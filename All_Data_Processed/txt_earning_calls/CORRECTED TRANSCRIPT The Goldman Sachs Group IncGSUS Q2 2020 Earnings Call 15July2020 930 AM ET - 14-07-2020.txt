your friends and your family remain safe and healthy during this unprecedented global health crisis let me begin on page of the presentation to review our financial results in the second quarter we produced net revenues of billion up versus a year ago the strength and breadth of our client franchise was evident this quarter as we delivered solid net earnings of billion earnings per share of and a return on equity of and a return on tangible equity of our results in the quarter were strong even while incurring higher credit provisions and litigation expenses both of which impacted our returns our second quarter results contributed to solid firsthalf revenues of billion net earnings of billion and an roe of and rote of litigation costs burdened our firsthalf returns by approximately basis points returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses the second quarter demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and was driven by significant new issue volumes and the countercyclical performance of our marketmaking activities we maintained our leading position the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 as the strategic advisor of choice for our investment banking clients with our strong league table positions across underwriting markets with extraordinary volumes in both debt and equity enabling us to pick up market share we delivered exceptional performance in ficc and equities on high levels of client activity deploying our risk intermediation expertise and our balance sheet on behalf of clients in a volatile market we continued to provide highquality advice to our wealth management clients and generated another quarter of solid consumer deposit growth in asset management we recognized gains from market appreciation in our public investments continued to harvest private equity positions and experienced a partial recovery in our credit portfolio from the first quarter importantly we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with an improving capital position amid high levels of market volatility and economic stress turning to the operating environment on page we are navigating an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop brought on by an extraordinary global health crisis during the second quarter we experienced both positive and negative forces reflecting the nearterm economic challenges related to recent business shutdowns counterbalanced by continued support from central banks and governments and market optimism as certain economies began to reopen however as we speak today the path to reopening in many us states and corresponding economic consequences remain unclear since our april earnings call our economists estimates for us gdp improved from an expected contraction in of to today driven by expectations of a faster rebound from a deeper trough that said on a global basis growth expectations for deteriorated from an expected decline in april to a contraction expected today with the second quarter reflecting a deeper decline in activity than expected three months ago the prospect for a steeper recovery in the second half is in no small part due to the forceful and rapid action by global central banks and governments which are providing exceptional levels of liquidity and ongoing fiscal stimulus these actions have been key to market resilience tempering the economic impact of the virus in the united states we are seeing early indications of economic improvement including the better than expected rebound in retail sales and notable improvement in unemployment in june to approximately from more elevated numbers in may as markets assess the impact of the virus in the second quarter and its potential economic consequence we experienced a rise in the valuation of risk assets during the second quarter the sp rallied by marking its best quarter since while broader global equity markets rose a similar amount investmentgrade spreads tightened by over basis points and highyield spreads tightened by roughly basis points this quarter in the context of these moves in financial assets strong levels of client engagement during the second quarter demonstrate the breadth and the strength of our franchise as we go forward as risk managers we continue to prepare for the prolonged economic challenges and look beyond market valuations and our overall assessment of risk we maintain a strong financial profile and remain agile with our balance sheet as we continue to serve our clients pivoting for a moment i am pleased to note that volatility in the first half of did not hinder our progress on most of our key growth initiatives on june we officially launched our transaction banking service to us clients on time and below budget despite the unexpected challenges of shifting our global team to workfromhome and launching the platform the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 remotely as of quarter end we have over clients on the platform and billion in deposits many of which we expect will become operational as clients begin their utilization of the platform over time second in alternatives we accelerated the marketing of a new credit fund called west street strategic solutions as a part of our transition to funddriven investing client receptivity has been very strong we believe this strategy is welltimed to capture opportunities in the market today and provide critical private financing to companies in need our approach is highly differentiated leveraging the broad global sourcing capabilities of goldman sachs just this week we have closed on over billion of commitments ultimately we expect to raise in excess of billion in the coming months what is most impressive is that our first close occurred in less than days entirely via virtual meetings we are broadening our client base to include leading institutions and pension fund investors that have not partnered with goldman sachs before these expanding relationships will be helpful to our efforts as additional strategies and funds are launched you will recall that this initiative was part of our strategy discussed at investor day in january and promises to be significant in our move toward a less capitalintensive more feedriven model for our investing platforms third in wealth management we continue to integrate our new high net worth business which we recently rebranded personal financial management yeartodate we have generated over client referrals between personal financial management and our flagship ultrahigh net worth private wealth business representing billion in assets under supervision opportunity as we now have a credible offering to serve high net worth clients that said establishing new wealth management relationships in the current environment with only virtual communications is challenging we would expect our progress to accelerate under more normal circumstances fourth we continue to expand our digital consumer business we were pleased to announce our new small business lending partnership with amazon which will allow us to leverage our proprietary digital underwriting decision platform using data shared by amazons thirdparty sellers to provide inventory and operational financing to support their growth this partnership which is being launched on a smaller scale at this moment is another example of our innovation and our ability to partner with leading corporations to deliver differentiated value to our customers our consumer partnerships also included our recent pointofsale financing engagement with jetblue and of course our credit card with apple before turning to stephen i would like to spend a moment on diversity and inclusion which is a critical priority for the firm and a personal focus of mine for many years like so many others over the past six weeks ive spent a lot of time listening and learning about the challenges we face as a nation on racial equity while goldman sachs has long sought to advance diversity and inclusion were still not where we need to be it is both a moral and economic imperative that we make progress we must be a diverse and inclusive organization to unlock our full potential as we serve a global marketplace that is diverse in all aspects including race ethnicity gender and sexual orientation lastly let me review our business resiliency and returntooffice strategy which has begun in our major offices globally the firm continues to seamlessly serve our clients while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrating the dedication of our people the strength of our technology and our business resiliency our firm has always had a teamoriented apprenticeship culture and we benefit from being and working together so as each of the communities where we operate reopens we are taking the necessary steps to gradually return to office in a safe manner the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 we are following the lead of our asia colleagues wherein hong kongs using a splitteam approach with up to working from the office were also making progress in europe where on the continent returned and in the uk where approximately of our employees are back in office recently in new york a small group of employees have returned to office going forward our progress will be dictated by circumstances in each region and we will adjust as needed we are taking many new precautions to ensure safety including through masks and social distancing and its certainly not business as usual but were making tangible forward progress as we take these steps we will continue to keep the health and safety of our people as our top priority in closing i would just like to say how proud i am of the people of goldman sachs they have worked tirelessly during this time to engage and serve our clients leverage technology to ensure our resiliency and prudently manage our risk and financial resources with that ill turn it over to stephen stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning let me begin with our summary results on page during the second quarter we saw very strong performance from our investment banking and global markets segments as clients were exceptionally active in raising capital in the equity and debt markets managing balance sheets repositioning investment portfolios and hedging risks across asset classes we also saw yearoveryear revenue growth in our consumer wealth management segment as we continued to expand our private wealth high net worth and consumer businesses gains across these three segments were partly offset by a decline in our asset management segment given smaller gains on equity investments versus a year ago before turning to segment results i want to spend a minute on capital particularly in light of the recent federal reserve stress test results on june we disclosed the federal reserves indicative stress capital buffer estimate for goldman sachs of which implies a common equity tier requirement of for the firm effective october while higher than anticipated this requirement is just slightly higher than our reported standardized cet1 ratio of as of june in fact our current cet1 ratio improved by basis points this quarter and is now basis points higher than where we started this year demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our capital while deploying balance sheet for our clients consistent with the federal reserves requirements for all large banks well extend the suspension of share repurchases into the third quarter but it is our intention to maintain our dividends both common and preferred while complying with the scb rule upon implementation furthermore we will continue to pursue our long standing practice of deploying capital to our business where returns are accretive and otherwise returning it to our shareholders as permissible and ever mindful of the environment as we consider the results of the stress test it is important to bear in mind that the firm like the industry experienced an actual stress test over the past few months the global economy contracted sharply and unemployment in the us hit levels higher than contemplated in the federal reserves severely adverse scenario during this period we maintained robust levels of liquidity and capital and despite the stress the firm emerged the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 from the second quarter stronger and continues to serve clients from a position of financial and competitive strength and with the objective of producing attractive returns for our shareholders looking forward we continue to believe that the to standardized cet1 target range provided at investor day is appropriate for our firm on a mediumterm basis but we recognize our nearterm capital requirement is higher in light of the stress test results we do not control the federal reserves scenarios and models but the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing the strategy outlined at investor day with a focus on diversifying our business mix and reducing the stress capital intensity of our balance sheet as david highlighted our execution of this strategy is advancing we have sold or announced the sale of nearly billion in equity investments yeartodate including our agreed sale of global atlantic just last week which will have positive implications for capital and balance sheet we remain committed to capital efficiency as we diversify our business and grow more durable revenues with that lets now turn to our business performance on page beginning with investment banking investment banking produced second quarter net revenues of billion up versus a yearago financial advisory revenues of million remain healthy but down versus last year amid fewer transaction closings consistent with the industry yeartodate we participated in nearly billion of announced transactions and closed over deals for billion of deal volume we maintained our number one position in both announced and completed ma league table rankings by a considerable margin while recent ma announcements have slowed our investment banking client dialogues remained very active with client interactions up over versus last year notwithstanding the continuing workfromhome dynamic in the second half we are watching for a potential pickup in ma activity both from companies coming from a position of strength as well as those challenged by the environment dislocated asset prices will help drive those opportunities as will the significant amount of private capital available for deployment that said macro and political uncertainty remain relevant and will influence outcomes as ma announcements declined in the quarter the headline for investment banking was in underwriting in these turbulent markets we have seen our underwriting market shares increase as clients have turned to goldman sachs particularly for more complex and innovative financings where execution matters in equity underwriting we delivered record quarterly net revenues of billion yeartodate we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting as our volumes jumped to over billion across more than deals we saw strong activity this quarter across ipos followons and private issuances convertibles also had record activity where we ranked number one in debt underwriting net revenues were million up from a year ago as we helped finance record us investmentgrade volumes and supported a broader reopening of the highyield market since the crisis hit our market shares in investmentgrade and highyield have increased globally driving our number four ranking in global debt underwriting this performance amidst the volatility of the last several months is the product of many years of strategic focus and investment in our client franchise given the pace of activity our investment banking backlog decreased significantly versus the first quarter this is a function of both the volume of our recent deal execution and slower replenishment it is also important to point out that the timeline from discussion to execution notably in financing has shortened in this period and therefore backlog may for the moment be an incomplete indicator of forward activity the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 revenues from corporate lending were negative million reflecting million of hedge losses for risk management purposes we maintain singlename hedges on certain larger relationship lending commitments as credit spreads tightened during the quarter we reversed much of the million hedge gain we saw last quarter with respect to relationship lending we also saw a meaningful reversal of corporate commitment draws in the quarter totaling billion in net paydowns as financing conditions improved and we helped clients access the capital markets the strong issuance market also enabled us to reduce our underwriting commitments in the deals book for example we successfully syndicated acquisition financings including billion for thyssenkrupp and billion for tmobile thereby reducing exposure to the firm moving to global markets on page where we experienced considerable strength in performance net revenues were billion in the second quarter growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity continued wider bidask spreads and strong risk management amid continued market volatility the business benefited from expanded market share as investment in the client franchise and our continued strategic commitment to a global business model with scale across asset classes bolstered performance turning to ficc on page net revenues were billion growth versus last year was driven by a increase in intermediation and increase in financing revenues in ficc intermediation we saw elevated client flows with all five of our businesses increasing versus last year in credit our performance benefited from broadbased client engagement and strength across investmentgrade highyield and distressed as well as bank loans amid wider bidask margins tighter credit spreads and high new issue volume we also saw continued success in systematic and electronic marketmaking including high utilization rates for our bond pricing engine and automated trading all leading to higher market share for the business in currencies we had another very active quarter with solid activity among corporates banks and hedge fund clients revenues improved as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume in the americas and europe our rates franchise also performed well on strong trading and highlevels of client activity as elevated volatility normalized amid coordinated global central bank stimulus in commodities strong trading performance was aided by high volumes and volatility across all of our businesses including oil natural gas and metals in mortgages net revenues improved significantly on strength in agency and nonagency trading partly offset by lower loan trading volumes lastly in ficc financing we saw considerable strength across repo and structured credit turning to equities net revenues for the second quarter were billion up versus a yearago equities intermediation net revenues of billion rose aided by robust performance in cash and derivatives amid elevated client volumes we saw strength across the board in commissions marketmaking electronic trading and etfs as we executed for a broad base of active passive hedge fund and systematic clients this reflects our multiyear efforts to leverage our scale and expand wallet share equity financing revenues of million declined yearoveryear driven by tighter spreads lower average client balances and weakness in europe given recent dividend cancellations finally across global markets we continued to invest in technology platforms to enhance user experience and straightthrough processing we also saw continued high levels of client activity on our marquee platform through the second quarter with our highestever external engagement in april moving to asset management now on page in the second quarter we generated segment revenues of billion down versus a year ago as a reminder this segment includes our platform that serves clients across a full spectrum of asset classes from liquidity to alternatives as well as our own onbalancesheet investing the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 activities as david mentioned we expect thirdparty investing in this segment to grow over time as part of our broader strategic initiatives management and other fees related to asset management clients totaled million up versus a yearago driven by higher assets under supervision offset by mix given growth in liquidity products equity investments produced million of net gains in the second quarter aided by asset sales and a significant rebound in the value of public equity positions more specifically on our billion public equity portfolio we recognized million of gains including approximately million in gains on avantor and sprout and significantly better performance across the broader portfolio despite recent gains we reduced the size of our public portfolio by roughly over the past five years on our billion private equity portfolio we generated eventdriven gains of approximately million from various positions including the sale of our uk student housing investment and airtrunk an australian data center both of which we announced last quarter these gains were offset by million of negative marks relating to certain covidimpacted and other investments this quarter approximately of companies in our private equity portfolio saw their performance impacted by covid19 lastly we also had positive revenues of million related to our consolidated investment entities in the private equity portfolio finally net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were million which include approximately million from net interest income with the remainder from gains on fairvalued debt securities and loans reflecting tighter credit spreads retracing nearly of the losses taken last quarter let me now turn to page where we provide further transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet on the left of this slide we show our equity investment portfolio broken out by sector geography and vintage we also provide new detail on our billion portfolio of cies these are primarily comprised of real estate investments of which billion are financed predominantly by nonrecourse debt at the bottom of the slide we show the diversification of the portfolio with only related to the retail sector and to hospitality on the right side of the slide we reflect our billion lending and debt investment portfolio which includes billion of loans that are predominantly secured and billion of debt investments we further break down these amounts by accounting classification sector and geography this portfolio comprises corporate and real estate loans and corporate debt securities we will continue to refine this disclosure to be responsive to questions from the investor community ill now turn to consumer wealth management on page in this segment we produced billion of revenues in the second quarter up versus a year ago driven by higher wealth management assets and higher consumer banking revenues for the quarter wealth management and other fees of million rose versus last year reflecting organic growth in the united capital acquisition assets under supervision rose versus the prior year to billion consumer banking revenues were million in the second quarter rising versus last year reflecting higher net interest income from credit card lending consumer deposits at quarterend totaled billion across the us and uk reflecting billion of growth in the quarter funded consumer loan balances remained stable at roughly billion of which approximately billion were from marcus loans and billion from apple card we continue to prudently riskmanage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 now lets turn to page for our firmwide assets under supervision total client assets increased to trillion up approximately billion versus the first quarter and up nearly billion versus a year ago this marks the first quarter in which we exceeded trillion in assets under supervision our sequential improvement was driven by billion of market appreciation billion of liquidity inflows and billion of longterm inflows on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide net interest income was million for the second quarter down sequentially and versus a year ago amid lower rates and an increase in our liquidity pool importantly and as i have noted previously as a firm our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks while our balance sheet is modestly assetsensitive given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets and hedge floating rate liabilities if interest rates remain stable we expect nii to gradually expand over time as our consumer deposits reprice next lets review loan growth and credit performance across the firm our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion down billion sequentially as we saw significant paydowns on corporate revolvers as i noted earlier our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was billion up million versus last quarter let me break this provision number down for you on the wholesale portfolio we took pool reserves of million as modeled losses under cecl were higher relative to the first quarter principally as a function of macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment and gdp worsening in the second quarter relative to similar inputs during the first quarter the million included both higher loss expectations and lower recovery rates we also took impairments on wholesale loans of million primarily related to credits in the industrials tmt and natural resource sectors included in the million of impairments was million related to hertz as the company declared bankruptcy this impairment was the largest in the quarter and was offset by gains on hedges which served as a riskmitigant with hedge gains reported in the lending subsegment of investment banking in our consumer portfolio provisions of million increased versus last quarter reflecting million of reserve build and million of net chargeoffs during the quarter we recognized firmwide net chargeoffs of million resulting in an annualized net chargeoff ratio of up basis points versus last quarter at quarterend our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at billion including billion for funded loans our allowance for funded loans increased basis points to for our billion accrual portfolio including an allowance for wholesale loans of and for consumer loans of next lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses of billion increased versus last year this includes higher compensation expense in line with revenue growth our noncomp expense growth was driven by million increase in brokerage clearing and exchange fees from higher client activity million of investments related to technology and new businesses including apple card and pfm and million in cie expense which should decline as we harvest these investments and a roughly million increase in litigation our reported yeartodate efficiency ratio was which was burdened by over percentage points due to litigation we continue to make progress on our mediumterm expense savings initiatives as set forth at investor day and expect to realize additional planned reductions in noncompensation expenses through the back half of the year finally our reported tax rate was for the yeartodate reflecting impact of higher earnings on permanent tax benefits and nondeductible expenses as noted previously we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 turning to our capital levels on slide as i mentioned common tier equity ratio for the firm was at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach up basis points sequentially more than recouping the decline seen in the first quarter the improvement was driven largely by earnings and rwa management our ratio under the advanced approach increased basis points to as higher capital was partially offset by higher rwas due to a full quarter impact of increased market volatility on the balance sheet total assets ended the quarter at trillion up versus last quarter we maintained strong liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging a record billion with growth largely commensurate with balance sheet expansion amid strong deposit growth on the liability side our total deposits increased to billion up billion versus last quarter which should enable us to maintain low levels of wholesale financing activity for the balance of the year as had been our intention in conclusion our second quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise and our ability to provide differentiated advice and market access in a volatile environment we maintain a prudent risk orientation mindful of continued uncertainty in the markets and the ongoing health crisis our core businesses are performing well and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan we remain confident in our financial position capital base and liquidity which set the foundation for our ability to serve our clients through this challenging time with that thank you again for dialing in and well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so my question on trading is towards the beginning of the year say at investor day we were talking about a little more focus on the financing side and felt like clients would pay for that and intermediation has been more commoditized and volatility was low and so what do you know intermediation spikes because the world goes crazy so im curious of two things on this front one is is the pickup in intermediation just a function of volatility and thatll subside as the world calms down has anything changed there in terms of pricing market share and the client needs for you thats part a and part b is on the financing front you did show progress it is growing but is there anything in the way the ccar stress testing goes that would frown upon that or would change your intention on continuing to grow the financing side david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks glenn thanks for the question its david thanks for the question im going to start at a high level on trading activity and i think stephen will answer the second point around financing and addressing your question as to potential impacts of ccar the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 theres no question that when we step back and we think strategically about our franchise we want to be in a position to serve our clients weve always had great confidence in the broad global footprint that we bring to global markets that were in all products all over the world and as our clients look to intermediate markets we have a full service capability to serve them theres no question that over the last decade in a period of very low interest rates and low volatility that has been a more commoditized service as you say in a period where theres enormous change and enormous volatility in markets we became super busy because our clients were super busy and the reason you see this pickup in activity is because there was a lot of activity from our clients i dont necessarily view that as permanent but at the same point it shows you that whether its in a more low muted environment where were well positioned to grow our financing business to serve our clients needs or in a period where our clients need more access to liquidity our franchise is very wellpositioned to serve them and i think weve got a benefit in this quarter from that positioning its obviously very hard to predict given the uncertain nature of the environment how this would continue id say upfront because i know itll be a question from a number of you that the activity levels that we saw at the end of march and in april were really extraordinary weve not seen the same level of activity over the course of the last five or six weeks since the beginning of june but i would say the activity levels over the last five or six weeks when looked at compared to activity levels in or still look pretty active and so we continue to see clients very very engaged in our markets business i think stephen should comment on financing ccar and how were thinking about that so ill pass to stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks david and thanks glenn for the question just to sort of pivot off of davids comments i would say the important thing to think about in the context of activity is that we were experiencing as david put it very elevated volumes at wider bidoffer and goldman sachs should have went to the market and didnt pull back and away from the market and in doing that weve picked up market share which i think will have lasting effect notwithstanding where the market goes in terms of its dynamic and the other thing i would point out is that in working through those flows we managed risk really well meaning we were not with elevated inventory we saw highvelocity turn in our risk in serving the intermediation needs of the clients and i think thats an important point to make on the financing side of the business overall its important to bear in mind financing in ficc was up about we saw considerable strength both in repo and in structured credit we saw similar activity on the equity financing side as well as it relates to scb and ccar i think that the ability of the firm to be agile and take our capital ratio up to kind of takes scb off the table and capital off the table in terms of our ability to present ourselves into the third quarter and beyond as ready and open to play the role we did in the second quarter which is stand ready to meet the intermediation and trading needs of our clients and i think the final comment id make just on capital is that we said during investor day that we would be agile meaning we would be agile with the deployment of capital in and around the businesses of the firm now at the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 time the questions that came to us were more about the ability to pull capital from the securities business not put to it in this quarter we moved capital to it returns were extraordinary super attractive and we were able to move that around as the kind of flexible organization that we like to think of ourselves as and well continue to do that based on what the market opportunity shows us glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi very helpful and thank you for all that one other question is you mentioned the sale of global atlantic i think that closes in a few quarters i think you guys should get a lot of respect for growing that from scratch basically just curious on how much of that what percent did you own goldman sachs own not the private client goldman sachs own sizing of the gain how much rwa that frees up and anything you could help on that considering its a good business its just really dense rwa i guess stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc no i mean glenn i think you characterized it exactly well and you hit the point which was our motivation for the sale itself which is this was a business that began in it was spun off in the second quarter of and over time because of its intensity as a financial institution it becomes more capitalintensive so obviously our motivation is to free up that capital and deploy it elsewhere around we were about of the ownership were selling out if not all then the preponderance of our position on that sale well release about billion of riskweighted assets and about million of attributed equity id also point out that this is part and parcel of kind of a larger move that will take place over the course of the entire year which is this will be part of about billion of sales off the balance sheet all part of our broader strategy of looking at lower capital intensity lower balancesheetintense investments and moving more towards thirdparty funds and so we will by the end of the year reduce that down by about billion that will relieve us of about billion of capital and about billion of riskweighted assets again global atlantic being part of that i would say roughly speaking almost half of that is done with the other half announced and spoken for and expected through the balance of the year operator your next question is from the line of christian bolu with autonomous please go ahead christian please go ahead and check your phone to see if its on mute christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp good morning thanks i was on mute there sorry stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey christian christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp so good morning david and stephen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp maybe just following up on the capital question just asked i guess if i think about your cet1 potential for another basis points of gsib surcharge maybe you might want some management buffer on top of what would be a minimum scb number your actual capital requirements could be approaching on the standardized side so maybe just help us think about how you think about getting that number back down to more like which is your longterm target and then sort of what are the implications for sort of your strategic growth initiatives to the extent you have to bring down capital by that much stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks christian so as i said in the prepared remarks we remain committed over the medium term to the range of to i think were executing at the moment in the moment meaning were in the midst of a pandemic obviously the results around ccar and the scb fixing was higher than what we had expected and perhaps reflects a view about where we are at a moment in the market but i think our strategy as articulated at investor day and frankly speaking what i described in the path toward reducing down capital intensity of our balance sheet investing are all part and parcel of our ability to take down what is otherwise meant to be represented in the peak to trough in the scb and so were executing now we are in a position having grown back our capital ratio to be within narrow distance of whats required but again thats a moment i wouldnt fix a permanent capital buffer nor look to amend what i view as our medium to longterm objective for a profile of the business which will benefit from key strategic initiatives which will lower the capital intensity of where were going and i think thats the forward path and so well remain quick on our feet as it relates to this but i just want to give you a sense of what the forward direction is for the firm itself christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp great thank you and then on cost very strong core cost control ex litigation in the quarter i believe you mentioned youd expect more noncomp benefit in the back half so maybe help quantify that for us and then maybe longerterm youve had a bit of a chance now to get a sense of the postcovid world and so how do you think about sort of structural expense trajectory particularly in light of that sort of billion target how much upside could there be in that number thank you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so in noncomp expenses as you suggest ex litigation our noncomp expenses are up about and a good portion of that increase is attributable to variable expense like bce so this is expense obviously related to the nature and level of activity that we experience in the business and the other portion of that increase is largely related to new businesses or largersized businesses than where we were a year ago so think the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 acquisition of united capital expenses associated with it or apple card and so expense control has been on the front of our mind what i expect to play out in the back half of the year will be as weve said previously the benefits from a reduction in double occupancy expense relating to real estate two buildings both in london and in bangalore that roll off and so as weve long planned and expected that will benefit us in terms of the reduction in noncomp expense overall on a more structural plane and thinking back to the billion of expense reduction that we articulated frankly i think we come at that number now with greater confidence in that number and frankly the ability to exceed it over the medium to long term and part of that is informed by judgments that we are making and analysis that were undergoing not just simply about the size of the firm but where the physical location of the firm can be that is our ability to take aggregation of people or whole businesses and look to move them to different locations either around the world or around the country and i think the flexibility and the agility that we can take from what weve witnessed in the context of the last several months only feeds our confidence and the ability to do that and therefore ability to hit the billion target or better over time operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning david good morning stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to ask just a followup on the funding optimization efforts that you guys have talked about before and certainly the deposit growth continues to surprise positively both on the consumer side as well as within transaction banking given that some of the growth appears to be tracking ahead of plan it sounds like youre quite confident on your expense savings targets from investor day i was hoping you could give us an update on the funding side as well whether you are still quite confident in that billion savings goal recognizing that a lot of its going to be dependent on term structure shape of the curve what have you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so on deposits your observation is right i mean total deposits for the firm now is billion thats up billion quarteronquarter marcus deposits now again through the retail channel are at billion that was up billion in the second quarter and were also seeing deposits come in though not yet operational in the transaction banking deposit side so the growth in the deposit channels overall has been really really positive the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 the question of whether we can harvest the precise level of savings of billion that we forecast rests largely on market sort of developments what i mean by that is the deposits in retail currently are from a financial point of view less valuable in the moment than where they were in the january investor day meaning weve seen fed funds come down by about basis points but we havent experienced corresponding beta on the downside in the retail deposit channel that will come over time as we develop a more sort of substantive and profound level of engagement with retail customers the reliance on rate will become less so and well be able to sort of capture back where we were but id say that much of what we premised our investor day presentation on was an assumption about normal markets were not in normal markets the precipitous decline in rates but not a corresponding decline in deposits will lessen some of the savings but i wouldnt sort of put too much of a permanent conclusion to that lets wait until we get to a more permanent state of a normal market to sort of judge that by the way by contrast we do see positive beta in other channels which play that way particularly in the high net worth channel but i think well need to sort of assess just the magnitude by the way none of that is to take away from the strategic value of this consumer and the overall deposit channel which is enabling us frankly faster than we thought to take out the wholesale funding channel and just by way of reference weve got about billion of wholesale debt through the balance of this year either maturing or subject to call and well be able to sort of act on that reducing down the liquidity that we hold all as a consequence of the growth that weve seen in the deposit channel overall steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc right and thanks for all that helpful color stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc maybe just a question for you david on the ma outlook and one of the concerns weve heard from folks is the challenging ma backdrop could very well persist just given low levels of ceo confidence and just uncertainty around the election and future tax policy i was hoping you could give some color as to what youre hearing from the csuite regarding appetite for ma and willingness to do deals and maybe what ingredients need to be in place to help reinvigorate deal activity here david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks for that question and of course youre right at a high level and weve always said this the number one thing that drives ma activity is ceo confidence and theres no question in this environment given the high level of uncertainty its much harder to see those same levels of confidence as a result of that as we highlighted in our opening commentary ma volume announced ma transactions in the second quarter were down and so as you would expect we saw a withdrawal of activity we obviously the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 saw closings on previous activity but we did not see replenishment in advisory transactions that we would normally see and id say that in march and april in particular and into the first half of may dialogue with ceos around forward strategic decisionmaking was very very limited people were in crisis mode and were very focused on dealing with the immediacy of the health care crisis and the crisis as it was affecting their businesses we had seen over the course of the last six weeks or so as economies around the world have started to reopen a reengagement by clients and ceos in their forward strategic view i would say that the dialogue levels right now are particularly robust i dont believe that well see shortterm activity but i would expect over the course of the next two to four quarters those activity levels will build as we have a clear understanding as to the overall direction of the health care issue that we all face and the overall economic impact that comes out of this and as people have more confidence theyll be able to move forward you did see one or two significant ma transactions during the course of the last week i want to be clear its not shut down but i think you need a more certain environment with better insight into the health care situation and the economic situation to see that replenishment normalize my guess is well get that but itll take a couple of quarters for sure operator your next question is from the line of mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning and thanks for taking the questions first one stephen just on the private equity sales this year i think you mentioned freeing up about billion of capital and if im not mistaken i think during the investor day you guys mentioned i think it was about billion over a period of three years so just curious is this more accelerated has that opportunity set expanded just trying to get an understanding of maybe the pace of that kind of strategic shift stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so you have the facts right i mean by the end of the year as i said well free up about billion which is of the way toward the objective of billion i would say that i dont view that billion as being in any way the limit of what we can get done the more we can advance and increase the cadence on the migration to lower capital density investing the better well be and well continue to pursue that obviously theres two sides to this that are both progressing i mean on one hand were effectuating sales that will relieve us of capital but were doing that not leaving ourselves in kind of a canyon of activity in that as we said during the prepared remarks weve really advanced on the raise of our first fund inside of days having a first close in excess of billion with a target of greater than billion and while we set out the objective of doing about billion of raise in and across a range of different funds i think we all have an expectation that well exceed the billion target we thought we would get to this year and look to revise targets across all of this as and when we think it appropriate but this is good forward progress and were very determined to see it happen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay thats helpful and just a followup just on the trading activity david i think you mentioned just higher activity yearoveryear even in the past couple weeks just when you think about it profit products and client type obviously we have ongoing volatility and uncertainty that kind of benefits the industry are you seeing any i dont know if i want to say like structural shifts in terms of goldman share gains more use of the electronic platforms additional client relationships that can maybe be more sustainable once some of this volatility starts to subside david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i appreciate the question michael there are a number of things going on that weve highlighted but to summarize or maybe put it in a different context that frames your question one of the things weve done over the last two years is weve thought very very carefully about our global markets franchise the way we wanted to center that franchise which was really around our clients we invested in a one gs approach that weve talked about that really tries to improve the client experience for our clients across that franchise and we started making an investment in those relationships improving wallet gaps improving shares thats an investment we started two years ago that was paying dividends but i think what you saw given the increased volatility and the heightened activity on the part of our clients we saw an acceleration of the benefits of some of that investment during the course of the end of the first quarter and the second quarter i think the real share gains there im getting a lot of feedback from clients directly that they really appreciate the way weve invested in the client centricity of that business the way weve kept the strong investment and really meeting their needs and i think weve reaped some dividends from that investment now as that continues well work to protect those share gains but id also highlight i still think theres upside for us when i look across the largest players in that business and i look at our share across the largest players and where were top three with the largest players while weve made progress i think we still have upside in the medium term if we continue to execute on our strategy to take more wallet share given the strength and the breadth of our franchise and were going to continue to remain focused on that operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy please go ahead and check to see if youre on mute betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you hear me david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc now we can stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 now we can betsy yes david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc now we can hear you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh okay all right thank you thanks for the time this morning i appreciate it stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so just a couple questions one i know that earlier there was a question around capital and how to utilize capital most efficiently and i wanted to raise it with regard to how seeing var traject over this past quarter and im wondering is there an opportunity here given the capital generation that youve been enabled to do and also the rwa compression that we lean into the var and keep var relatively high i know in the quarter it was up significantly qonq but how much of that is marketrelated and how much do you anticipate running at maybe a higher var than you have had in the past given your capital flexibility that you have stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so i think the premise of your question betsy sort of strikes at the answer which is we do have capital flexibility to elevate our var using var as a basis or as a metric if you will for extending into client needs so both responding to the need for intermediation and positions deploying capital against it and equally being responsive to the possibility of the market inflating such that var increases in the context of inflated notional positions with particular credits and so i think we feel very comfortable and part of the reason to take up our capital to sort of adequate levels relative to where we will be required to be i think gives us greater confidence to see var inflate to the extent that we are in a position to serve our clients in periods of continued uncertainty as davids been speaking about in the markets more broadly betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and was there anything this quarter in particular that drove var i guess last quarter it was an million average var and this quarter was million i know thats total but it was up across the board in the various categories maybe if you could speak to what you saw in this quarter that drove that var up and what you think could be sustained into the second half of the year and what that means for trading revenues jamie yesterday said you should cut in half your trading revenues for but where do you stand on that kind of question stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 well i dont think any of us are in a position to make such a declarative judgment about exact direction of trading revenues and through the second half of the year i think that what we need to do is set ourselves up to be in the service of clients and avail ourselves for the benefit of our shareholders of the opportunities as they present and i think david characterized it well which is the second half will be more characterized by uncertainty than any ability to forecast up or down in the market itself and i think were wellpositioned from a liquidity from a capital and from a risk point of view to be able to avail ourselves the one thing i would say as we think about risk in markets like this is drawing the distinction between whats liquid and whats not so when i look at the firm i think that inventory was managed in the pursuit of intermediation in the trading business exceptionally well we saw very high velocity as weve long been looking to work with our securities leadership to do in terms of seeing quicker turnover in inventory in support of trading activity when i look at illiquid this is an area where from a risk point of view we used market opportunities to lower for example commitments made in the deals book and took that book down and took risk down and positioned ourselves now to take on more risk in through the second half of the year to the extent that those opportunities present themselves and so i feel quite good and confident about where we stand from a risk position not limited what we do in trading activity which will present itself but equally around other areas of the firm with more structural and kind of less liquid risk to take onboard operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well my short question is look youre the number one advisor so what are you advising clients to do and how are you allocating the firms resources to back that up and the color behind that is it seems like the elephant in the room is look covid cases are going up i think death rates ph followed by about four weeks per an expert that we had on a call and then you have shut downs and youre seeing the shutdowns like in california and elsewhere so theres two scenarios here one is maybe goldman is needed less that investors and your clients go home and sit on the sidelines too much risk or maybe goldman sachs is needed more as you said more complex deals wider bidoffer spreads elevated volumes have more of a freakout market where you guys stay open for business so what are you advising clients how are you reallocating your resources for that and what are your thoughts on my questions david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well its a very uncertain environment mike its a very uncertain environment and so one of the things were advising clients is that its a very uncertain environment and they have to bring caution and planning to everything they do i watch tv and read the news like everyone else and im sometimes quite surprised by how certain people are i continue to be relatively uncertain as to the trajectory of all this as ive said before we need to understand the health care risks associated with the virus and get to a point where people feel safe and comfortable obviously a vaccine would be a meaningful step forward with respect to that while theres no question that theres progress with respect to a whole bunch of companies that are making the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 significant investments in a vaccine and there was positive news again this morning the exact trajectory of that and how itll be deployed and whether itll work and the effectiveness of all of that is still unclear and uncertain im confident we will get through this but the timing and the impact is relatively uncertain weve also because of the shutdowns economically all around the world have slowed economic activity theres no question as reopenings occurred weve seen a pickup in that activity but with an increase in viruses and this uncertainty persisting i think youll see a flattening in that economic pickup and that will slow the progress we make economically from here so we continue to revise clients to be thoughtful and cautious about that with respect to goldman sachs being open and ready and willing to serve our clients theres no question in the second quarter that our clients were extremely active and we were there to support them its unclear how active theyll be in the third quarter but there will be activity well be open and at the end of the third quarter we can kind of look back and say how that unfolded but i think weve proven and well continue to prove with great humility that we can be flexible we can work remotely we can adapt and we can also help clients adapt and so this is a very challenging time for everyone the human toll of this crisis is really very significant everyone is focused on their employees everyone is focused on their businesses and their stakeholders and their shareholders and i think that people need to be cautious because the economic repercussions of this will play out over the medium term and this is not going to be in my opinion a quick resolution and well continue to try to be nimble and flexible and help our clients navigate what i think will continue to be a very uncertain period mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc as a followup just as it relates to capital markets were all trying to fill in our models for the next several quarters what could be the next step in capital markets in terms of repositioning of portfolios due to the election and another government stimulus or reamplification continuing or you mentioned mergers where you said volumes are still above the level last year even if coming down people tend to give you a pe of on your earnings like a quarter such as this whereas you talk about the annuity with your clients so im just trying to figure out kind of whats the next step with capital markets at goldman sachs david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think our capital markets businesses have long been a leader and weve been positioned as a very very strong leader in ma advisory activity and equity underwriting activity for decades weve made a significant investment over the last decade in our debt capital markets business and i think over the last few years youve seen the benefits of that investment and i think were very wellpositioned to help our clients meet their capital markets needs capital markets is a volatile business yet through the cycle our capital markets businesses produced significant activity and significant profitability i dont have a crystal ball as to whats going to happen in the next six months ive had some discussions with people where people talk about some capital markets activity being pulled forward and theres no question that some refinancing has been pulled forward at the same point theres been a whole bunch of activity that we could have never imagined would have recurred because of the virus and the economic consequences of the shutdowns so when you look at industries like airlines and cruise and travel and leisure theres been an enormous amount of capital markets activity that was completely unanticipated and so as we look forward over the next six months i think therell be other things based on the macro environment that will either lead to a pickup in some the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 places or a decrease the one thing i know for sure is our franchise on a global basis is very wellpositioned to meet our clients needs as that activity occurs stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc mike the only thing i would add to davids comment is that and this goes back to the initial question you asked which is what are we doing with our clients i mean you can look in the capital markets at the need to apply more creativity to structured solutions for clients than perhaps what weve seen in kind of straightway issuance in more normalized markets look at the deal that was completed for united airlines which i think brings some interesting ingenuity and structure to what otherwise in the normal course would have been a fairly straightway financing and i think thats the nature and level of engagement with the clients that were experiencing and i think it responds a bit to the question of where the capital markets are going there may be more of a need of that right in the uncertainty that davids been addressing operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question appreciate all the time this quarter you guys made a purchase of folio an ria platform and was kind of curious if you could maybe give a little color on that was that purely for use by united capital or is there interest in providing thirdparty custody services in the ria space which is a market where were seeing some consolidation and theres a lot there were going from three to two strong providers of pure custody so just curious if thats part of the plan there stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think the way to think about it is is that in the end were looking to continue to build out kind of three components of that business theres obviously our ultrahigh net worth business theres the high net worth business pfm which was the united capital i think folio serves to clearly provide added heft to that component of what were trying to build the third leg in that stool would obviously be a more mass affluent consumer piece but the acquisition of folio was clearly aligned with the strategy begun under united capital and the provision of thirdparty custody more broadly so i think it fits both a generalized strategy but equally it is entirely consistent with what we were trying to build out in the high net worth or pfm space which was the united capital asset itself brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you for that stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thinking about your comments on the ma market interesting and very helpful about the pickup in dialogue in the last six weeks and clearly theres a lot of uncertainty as you flagged with health care and the economic trajectory but we also hear about the election uncertainty holding back some component of activity in the us are you seeing a difference or a significant divergence in the level of dialogue in the united states versus other geographies and is it the other geographies thats leading to the greater engagement or are you seeing it pick up in the us as well just the nuance on that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so sure brennan and what i would say is i dont see a difference in engagement levels in the us versus lets say the rest of the world engagement levels were way down engagement levels are picking up everywhere while the election is certainly something that i think will get a lot of attention over the next five months its still five months away and i think that the health care crisis and the economic crisis as a result of the health care crisis has had a much bigger impact on engagement levels than the election as to how the election starts to impact decisionmaking i can see it in some ways being an accelerant and in some ways potentially creating uncertainty and slowing things down but i dont think the election cycle is yet playing a big role in client engagement operator your next question is from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david and stephen thanks for all the time stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc so just want to drill a little bit more into the progress in transaction banking and really just trying to think about the scaling in that business clients today and making some progress on deposits i guess where do you feel like you are in terms of market share with those clients so are they kind of test driving the platform today but theres still kind of a huge opportunity of maybe more penetration and then as you think about kind of scaling that platform kind of what are they using today why are they using goldman sachs and whats the opportunity to do more with them david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 sure appreciate the question and i know theres been a lot of interest in this theres also been a lot of questions about our ability to execute on this if you go back strategically one of the reasons that we were very confident in building this platform is we were a big customer of other institutions and we saw a need based through our own experience and weve really put together what we think is a very very frictionfree digital platform that advances the connectivity that clients have to their financial institution and easeofuse in very very meaningful ways the rollout has gone very very well i think weve been very cautious and conservative as we talked about it particularly at investor day around client takeup i think one of the reasons we felt comfortable that we could build a platform and attract clients to it if we built a good platform is that we have relationships with all these clients these relationships are real they rely on us we lend to these clients and if we had an offering that was competitive we felt it was a reasonable ask of our clients to consider our offering i think what youve seen in this initial rollout is a lot of clients have considered our offering and the first and easiest way to consider it is to leave deposits with us to onboard get an account see the ease of use in doing that and leave deposits with us and so i think thats accelerated at a much faster pace than we expected we have had a handful of significant clients turn operational which is obviously where the business becomes much more attractive to us and i would expect over the course of the medium term we will grow a very substantial business where these clients become operational on our platform and that will lead to significant fee based revenue streams that will help that business grow but were in the very early stages our market share is tiny we dont have enormous market share aspirations but we will grow this business we believe nicely over the medium term and it will make a reasonable contribution to the overall diversification of goldman sachs devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific appreciate that and then just a followup question just around the comp ratio so yeartodate the accrual is versus last year in the first half so im trying to just kind of parse through how much of that is actually some of those expense savings coming through versus maybe leverage on mix or the fact that revenues were up so trying to think about the accrual and how you guys are thinking about that relative to where you were last year stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so the way we think about it is that in each and every quarter we take an accrual as at that quarter as to what we forecast we need to pay the organization and compensate the organization on a payforperformance basis and its not more than that theres no signaling thats embedded in it or otherwise i think a good deal of the savings is not anticipated in the context of lowering our comp ratio its really looking at the balance of expenses that i was addressing to an earlier question in terms of what we can do to bring down some of the noncomp expense and overall bring our operating expenses down but fixing this at as you may remember we were at last year and so this is an ongoing quarterbyquarter assessment of what we need to do taking a look at the overall performance of the business itself operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global securities please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 hey good morning maybe just a question on the scb and dfast just trying to if we look at trading as you guys pointed out and i agree youve seen almost a countercyclicality in trading revenues holding up very well in this kind of a stress test we just had from covid yet losses in trading through dfast are still pretty high so when we think about your scb going forward do you think theres any opportunity of sort of the fed sort of recalculating how they think about trading losses which could be a benefit to you or is simply the view to get the scb sort of down is to just continue to do what youre doing over time and remix assets just trying to see if you think theres a potential for a little benefit from the performance over the last six months stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so i would say that for us pursuing both paths of petition and action is right meaning theres a doit yourself proposition here which is to drive what weve been talking about that is lower capital intensity of balance sheet investing thirdparty funds and the like all of that is subject to selfhelp and we are minded to aggressively address that so as to bring the intensity down as a related matter i think as you would imagine we have been very active in our engagement and discussions with the fed about the very observation youre making which is when we look back historically at our own performance volatility carries a positive correlation to trading revenue and its not uncorrelated and we have a view about what that means in the context of what the downdraft would be and have been engaged in a very active dialogue with the fed on that topic how to handicap the outcome of that is an impossibility and so it is why notwithstanding that petition we continue to engage in selfhelp and look to remedy this on our own terms james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc well its good to hear youre at least asking and just maybe one quick followup on the advanced cet1 given the scb is based on standardized i mean is there any constraints does it matter the advanced cet1 i hate to say it that way but does it stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think the rating agencies appropriately take a look at the advanced and remember this has the cva component in it thats not represented in standardized and so youve got to be mindful in managing all of these capital ratios that theres not one but many constituencies to bear in mind and so we do that and obviously pay attention to all of these ratios in the context of how we carry ourselves operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sure thanks just one real quick one on credit is there any way you guys could give an update on kind of where youre at with regards to deferrals and delinquencies and then also how youre thinking about reserve builds from here i mean youve built the reserve a decent amount this quarter i mean is this the peak or are you guys sufficiently reserved for goforward losses thanks the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2020 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so why dont i start on deferrals or forbearance so its quite light across our whole portfolio theres only of total credit itself that is subject to forbearance its higher in the consumer portfolio its been about of the total portfolio that has taken up forbearance interestingly of those that do about are current on their payments but bear in mind thats a very small component of the overall risk profile of the firm at billion total so over across the whole of it its about its not significant in the context of how we operate and how we think about the risk overall given how low it is i would say as it relates to the consumer it is one reason why the coverage ratio that we have through our reserve on a consumer portfolio is as high as it is at thats not at all a reflection of our current experience in terms of losses losses actually are trending lower notwithstanding the moment in the market but out of prudence and caution and given how young that portfolio is and given the fact that forbearance can mask risk weve taken up our provision there more generally on your question about provisioning as you note we took a provision of billion in the quarter the methodology we use is the same we did in the first and will hold ourselves going forward which is we look at macroeconomic indicators including unemployment that sort of correlate well to expectations around default rates and then pull that through to avail ourselves of pool reserves and we broke that down in the prepared remarks which amounted to about million of the billion thats there with the balance being impairments and the consumer component of provisions that i spoke about it leaves us with a coverage ratio of about which i think is roughly in line with where the market is and accurately reflecting risk thats there so what happens in the forward itll purely be a function of what plays out in the market and whether certain of these macroeconomic indicators worsen or improve from here and that obviously will flow through our model and dictate the level of provisioning we take brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay since there are no more
