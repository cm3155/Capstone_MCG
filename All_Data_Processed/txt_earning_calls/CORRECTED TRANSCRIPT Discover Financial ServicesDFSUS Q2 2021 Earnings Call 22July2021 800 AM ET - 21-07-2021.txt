question followed by one followup question after your followup question please return to the queue now its my pleasure to turn the call over to roger roger c hochschild president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks eric and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call we had a very good quarter that highlighted the strength of our digital business model and solid execution on our strategic priorities against the backdrop of continued economic improvement this quarter was characterized by three important events first our card receivables grew sequentially in may and june causing our periodend receivables to be up quarteroverquarter this outcome combined with the strength in consumer spending and our account acquisition increased our confidence for moderate receivables growth this year and stronger growth in second we benefited from a gain in our payment services segment this gain is an outgrowth of a long audio gap commercial relationship and underscores our payments ability to forge innovative and lasting partnerships lastly we achieved a historic low in delinquencies which resulted from consumers strong liquidity position our conservative stance on underwriting and the proactive measures we took into the downturn to protect our credit quality this outcome also supported our reserve release this quarter discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 turning to the quarters results we earned billion after tax or per share these results include a million onetime gain but even excluding this gain our results were very strong at per share the drivers of the quarters strong results reflect the combination of our solid execution and supportive macro conditions total sales were up from a year ago and from the second quarter of retail sales remained very strong and there was significant improvement in te categories which were hardest hit by the pandemic even travel returned to growth in june compared to ph and sales volumes are accelerating the growth i cited is an increase from in the first quarter relative to the same period in we also see an attractive environment for account acquisition even in the face of heightened competition we have removed nearly all of our pandemic credit tightening and have increased our marketing investment to align with these actions these decisions supported new account growth of over levels with strong growth among prime consumers as our differentiated brand and integrated networks support our strong value proposition which centers on transparent and useful rewards outstanding customer service and no annual fees while the current operating environment is broadly constructive there are also some challenges as we have highlighted before the counterpoint of sustained strong credit performance is high payment rates which in the second quarter were over basis points above levels we may be seeing evidence that payment rates are plateauing and while we expect some moderation later this year we believe payment rates will remain above historical levels for some time even so we expect to strengthen our sales figures and the contribution from new accounts to drive loan growth through the back half of this year and accelerate in as we have said in the past we will invest when we see attractive opportunities and the actions we took this quarter would increase marketing expenses and investments in technology and analytics were an example of that approach these investments are consistent with our commitment to longterm positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio as they drive loan growth and enable a more efficient operating platform in our payments business we benefited from a gain on our equity investment in marqeta this gain was the result of a relationship that began a decade ago and we continue to see ph opportunities and innovative partnerships im very excited about our investment in sezzle that ph was announced last week as we look to expand our partnership with a leading buy now pay later provider we also continue to grow our global acceptance presence and announced new partnerships in bahrain and portugal adding to the two network alliances that we announced earlier this year our debit business continued to build on its recent strength pulse volume increased yearoveryear and was up from levels in addition to the influence of economic recovery this performance reflects the greater relevance of debit to many consumers through the pandemic period volume at diners has also recovered to some extent and was up from the prior years lows however volume is still below the prepandemic levels and may remain so for a period of time the strong fundamental performance of our digital banking model drove significant capital generation which this quarter was also aided by our equity gain we accelerated our share repurchases to million of common stock a level near the maximum permitted under the federal reserves four quarter rolling net income test we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders and going forward our approach will be governed by the stress capital buffer framework on our call last quarter we indicated that we hope to revisit our capital return for the second half of this year and im very pleased that our board of directors authorized the new billion share repurchase program that expires next march we also increased our quarterly dividend from to per share discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 with the current strength of the us economy im increasingly optimistic about our growth opportunities this year and beyond our value proposition continues to resonate with consumers our payments segment is expanding its partnerships and acceptance and our capital generative model positions us for strong returns over the long term ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone ill begin with our summary financial results on slide as roger noted our results this quarter highlighted the strength of our digital model solid execution on our priorities and continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment revenue net of interest expense increased from the prior year excluding onetime items revenue was up net interest income was up as we continue to benefit from lower funding costs and reduced interest chargeoffs reflecting strong credit performance this was partially offset by a decline in average receivables from the prior year levels excluding onetime items noninterest income increased driven by higher net debt count and interchange revenue due to strong sales volume the provision for credit losses decreased billion from the prior year mainly due to a million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a billion reserve build in the prior year an improvement in the ph economic outlook and ongoing credit strength were the primary drivers of the release net chargeoffs decreased or million from the prior year operating expenses were up primarily reflecting additional investments in marketing which was up and ph higher employee compensation which was up a software writeoff and a nonrecurring impairment at diners club also contributed to the increase ill provide more details on expense drivers and outlook later in the presentation moving to loan growth on slide ending loans increased sequentially and were down just from the prior year this was driven by card loans which increased from the prior quarter and were down yearover year lower yearoveryear card receivables reflect two primary factors first the payment rate remains high as households continue to have a strong cash flow position due to several rounds of government stimulus second promotional balances were approximately basis points lower than the prior year quarter while card receivables declined yearoveryear we considered a sequential increase to be an important data point reflecting continued momentum in account acquisition and very strong sales volume the high payment rate remains a headwind to receivable growth although we expect to see modest decreases in late looking at our other lending products organic student loans increased from the prior year we are well positioned as we enter the peak origination season personal loans were down driven by credit tightening last year and high payment rates we are encouraged by continued strong credit performance in the portfolio and have expanded credit from new originations moving to slide net interest margin was up basis points from the prior year and down basis points sequentially compared to the prior quarter the net interest margin decrease was mainly driven by a nearly basis points reduction in the card revolve rate discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 loan yield decreased basis points from the prior quarter mainly due to the lower revolve rate this decline reflects the impact of increased payments as well as seasonal trends yield on personal loans declined basis points sequentially due to lower pricing student loan yield was up basis points margin benefited from lower funding costs primarily driven by maturities of higher rate cds we cut our online savings rate to basis points in the first quarter and did not make any pricing adjustments during the second quarter average consumer deposits were up yearoveryear and declined from the prior quarter the entire sequential decline was from consumer cds which were down while savings and money market deposits increased from the prior quarter consumer deposits are now of total funding up from in the prior period looking at slide excluding the equity investment gains total noninterest income was up million or yearoveryear net discount and interchange revenue increased million or as revenue from strong sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards costs loan fee income increased million or mainly driven by higher cash advance fees with demand increasing as the economy reopens looking at slide total operating expenses were up million or from the prior year employee compensation increased million primarily due to a higher bonus accrual in the current versus when we reduced the accrual excluding this item employee compensation was down from the prior year as we managed head count across the organization marketing expense increased million from the prior year as we accelerated our growth investment we still see significant opportunities for growth and we plan to accelerate our marketing spend through the year to drive account acquisition and brand awareness information processing was up due to a million software writeoff fee increase and other expense reflect a million charge on the remainder of the diners intangible asset partially offsetting this was lower fraud expense reflecting some of the benefits from our investments in data analytics moving to slide we had another quarter of improved credit performance total net chargeoffs were down basis points yearoveryear and basis points sequentially the credit card net chargeoff rate was basis points lower than the prior year quarter and down basis points sequentially net chargeoff dollars were down million versus last years second quarter and million sequentially the card 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points from the prior year and basis points lower sequentially credit in our private student loans and personal loans also remained very strong through the quarter moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we released million from the reserves due to three key factors continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment sustained strong credit performance with improving delinquency trends and lower losses these were partially offset by a sequential increase in loans our current economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately by yearend and gdp growth of embedded within these assumptions are the expanded child care tax credits and the benefit from the infrastructure physical package beginning in late looking at slide our common equity tier ratio increased basis points sequentially to a level well above our internal target of as roger noted we are committed to returning capital the recent board approval increasing our buyback and dividend payouts reflect that on funding we continue to make progress towards our goal of having deposits between to of our mix discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 moving to slide our perspectives on continue to evolve as we see additional opportunities to drive profitable growth we have increasing confidence in our outlook for modest loan growth in as strong sales and our new account growth should offset the higher payment rates we expect nim will remain in a relatively narrow range compared to the first quarter levels of with some quarterly variability similar to what we experienced this quarter we anticipate a slight benefit from higher coupon deposit maturities and an optimized funding mix with yields affected by variability in the revolve rate our commitment to disciplined expense management has not changed and we remain focused on generating positive operating leverage and an improving efficiency ratio for this year we now expect nonmarketing expenses to be up slightly over the prior year reflecting the higher compensation accruals and recovery fees the increase in the use expense categories is closely tied to the economic recovery for example the high level of consumer liquidity is supporting elevated recoveries these recoveries have some costs associated with them but are more than offset by lower credit losses regarding marketing expenses we expect this will step up more significantly in the second half of as we further deploy resources into account acquisition and brand marketing with the continued improvement in credit performance our current expectation is that credit losses will be down this year compared to naturally a material change in the economic environment could shift the timing and magnitude of losses lastly as evidenced by our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in summary we had another very strong quarter we are well positioned for a positive topline trajectory given our sales trends and new account growth credit remains extraordinarily strong and the economic outlook continues to improve we maintained our discipline on operating expenses while audio gap returning organic growth opportunities and finally we continue to deliver high returns allowing for enhanced buybacks and dividends with that ill turn the call back to our operator to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi just wonder if you can good morning just wonder if you can give a little more color on the payment rate expectation i guess just what do you see and that gives you confidence in the moderate decline expected for the back half of this year and if you could talk about the how you weigh the risks that the payment rate may not moderate from here and then secondly on that are you seeing any differences in your fico bands in terms of the payment rate behavior thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great yeah ill take the call ill take the question john thanks for that so payment rates are frankly at a record high so if you looked at our trust data you can see that in june they came in at about and thats frankly thats an alltime high at least as far as back as so what were seeing when we look at the portfolio and on the portfolio the trends are similar but the overall payment rates a bit lower what were seeing is a couple of factors so one is a deceleration of the growth in payment rate and second we formed our expectation on the second half of the year based on all of the government programs that are out there and the most significant ones are expiring or have expired by the end of the third quarter so we expect that coupled with the strong economic activity and lower savings rate that were observing to result in a moderate decrease in the payment rate certainly in the fourth quarter in the third quarter it could be flat to maybe even up a mild bit but overall our sense is that weve approached the peak of this and its going to begin to tail off roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services and in terms of the mix by fico band its pretty broad certainly the higher fico skew transactor so youll have a higher payment rate in some of the mid ficos youve seen revolvers turned transactor but again to johns point we do expect it gradually to normalize discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great now thats helpful and then separately i appreciate the commentary around the loan growth expectation and you also expect some variability in your margin so what does that imply for your net interest income expectations if you could elaborate a little bit on that in terms of the second half trajectory there and possibly going into john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so ill touch upon it so the net interest income will follow loan growth but as you know in the fourth quarter the build on loan balance is skewed towards the last two months of the quarter so net interest margin is what ill say the trajectory is changing in a positive direction given the sequential loan growth we saw from first quarter to second quarter but again its going to be in the singledigits lowersingledigits is general expectation operator your next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess my first question is i know everyone is sort of waiting for the consumer to re lever and theres positive signs but maybe roger you could just speak to the competitive environment i mean obviously everyones chasing growth or wanting to grow or maybe you could just speak to how its out there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thanks sanjay as weve discussed in the past the card business is always competitive there was a nice little lull last year that ph were able to take advantage of and pickup even more market share but i think this is returning to more normal maybe a little heightened but more normal level of competition youre seeing new products out there increased marketing spend but as i look at our value proposition audio gap cost per accounts were achieving and the returns i feel very very good about the marketing spend were putting out there and what were generating for it sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great my followup is on the sezzle investment obviously theyre an up and coming buy now pay later company im just curious sort of if you could speak to that specific investment and how you see that unfolding for yourselves both in terms of the investment itself but also strategically inside of buy now pay later thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so in terms of our buy now pay later strategy therere really two parts the sezzle investment is really being driven by the payment side and thats similar to the investment we made in marqeta a while back our set of network assets are very useful for many fintechs in terms of just an easier way to process payments and connect to merchants in a wide variety of forms so id say thats the core of what were doing with sezzle discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 we also believe that potentially over time there may be opportunities on the banking side so in terms of our providing lending not necessarily with sezzle but in the buy now pay later space more broadly and again leveraging what we can do with unsecured lending and our direct merchant relationships but id say we havent announced anything on the lending side of buy now pay later at this time operator your next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning ryan roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc john or roger can you maybe just talk about the expectations for monetizing the marqeta gain how much do you expect to reinvest versus used for repurchases is it already factored into the buyback second can you maybe just remind us what the lockup is and your intention for the stake and maybe just lastly this increase in expenses that we have right now marketing and nonmarketing investments how much of these are being driven by the marqeta again and should we expect these to be one time in nature or should we expect them to stay in the run rate thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay all right ryan thanks so the marqeta gain was something that when we looked at the plan for the year we didnt frankly envision that that opportunity would turn out quite the way it did so certainly a nice outcome the spend that were seeing isnt dictated based on that size of the marqeta gain but more about the broad economic opportunity that were seeing right now to be able to drive positive growth so frankly well be spending at this level with or without the marqeta gain the kind of the lockup those points are disclosed in the s1 so you can reference that and get real specificity on it and then finally in terms of the expenses and are they onetime in nature so within the presentation itself we highlighted kind of three items that were significant so one was the bonus accrual unrelated to marqeta again and more broadly a reflection of whats happening in the business and the outcomes were seeing here in terms of generating positive returns the other item there was the diners intangible which we took the opportunity based on what we see as a change in the cash flows in diners to fully impair that and took a million writeoff discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 and then the third item was a million software writeoff so all those are part of our normal ill say hygiene factors so the last two items were what i would consider relatively oneoff and i wouldnt include those in the kind of operating cash flows going forward but as youre trying to get a sense for overall spend in we talked about accelerating marketing expense so the way i would think about marketing specifically is that we anticipate it to return to levels which would indicate a material acceleration in the second half of the year which again is tied to the fact that were seeing good origination opportunities to drive growth and longterm profitability ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color on that and maybe as my followup so you announced the new billion buyback but just given how high the levels of profitability are youre still going to be well above the level so can you maybe just help us understand the strategy of getting the capital down over what timeframe are you managing all into cecl day one and then maybe attached to that roger you talked about potential lending opportunities and buy now pay later weve seen others take some go at it organically some go via acquisition what would you expect to be the strategy for discover on a goforward basis thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services all right so ill hit the capital point real quick and then well flip it over to roger to handle it back second part of that question the second part of that second question i should say so the capital plan was based on a couple of different factors so one we want to be prudent in our distributions of capital and make sure that we allocate our capital to organic growth opportunities and then buybacks and dividends and then acquisitions as they appear so that hasnt changed whatsoever the planning in terms of capital overall is that we are committed to that as we look at the impacts of the cecl capital relief transition thats about basis points and then in the first quarter of next year towards the end of this year as we review the outlook for with our board well make recommendations with a couple points in mind the overall economic opportunity the scb and where we are with that and theres plenty of room there and then finally approaching the roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and in terms of buy now pay later there are many sort of different things we could do clearly going direct with the merchant relationships we have is one option we could work with partners i think the market is still very immature and thats why youre seeing many different combinations and it will evolve over time but we dont have anything specific to share at this time operator your next question is from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 hi good morning roger kind of a bigger picture question around technology spend just want to get your thoughts on where your head is right now whether youre kind of making enough investments in ai and machine learning and staffing different financial institutions are at different points of the cycle roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah it is a major source of investment for us and i would say the scarcest asset there is talent as opposed to technology dollars and then part of it is just making sure youre investing to monetize the granularity you can pickup with enhanced data and analytics so looking at the entire martech stack your personalization abilities what you can deliver through different channels so its a big focus i think were probably the only major bank where the head of data and analytics is a direct report to the ceo and so i think that reflects the importance we see on that and i feel very good about our level of investment donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator your next question is from bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you i appreciate it good morning question just a followup i guess on roger your investments in like marqeta and sezzle and just the thought i mean how are you working with marqeta how are these investments improving the product set if you would for discover and are there more of these types of investments or could they become acquisitions in the future roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so all of these investments start with a commercial relationship we are not venture capitalists we have no desire to get into that business but where we have a commercial relationship with a company where we think theres a lot of potential and there is a way to invest and perhaps extract additional terms maybe an exclusive arrangement or other commitments those are the types of opportunities we pursue and they are largely on the payment side and we may even given some of the opportunities were seeing accelerate that although again its going to be relatively modest in terms of acquisitions given the valuations im not sure i necessarily see doing acquisitions and this approach around partnership and investment seems to work well but we will look at it john and our payments team have a very strong business development effort and well consider acquisitions where its a capability that will help us monetize our payments assets robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc great thank you a followup on spend your chart on page the acceleration through the quarter relative to i mean are you surprised by the level of spend that were seeing and how do you think about that relative to the longterm trend i guess if you take this quarter you maybe had a compound growth from in but discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 were you surprised by this and the acceleration through the quarter and your thoughts on spend growth as you lap as you look at and onward roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i mean i think compound growth is a very challenging measure because it smooths an unbelievable cycle that i dont think any of us would have expected in so the yearoveryear spend growth numbers are unsustainably high for the economy as a whole the economy is growing above i think what economists would say its real level should be and so youre seeing that pentup demand from consumers we expect it to normalize at a strong level and we look to continue gaining market share given how were positioned but i dont think anyone is expecting retail sales to stay up forever operator your next question comes from mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks i had a question about the reserve levels could you give us some sense of what youre kind of contemplating both from a delinquency and chargeoff perspective in those reserves i mean i think trends have obviously been very benign and yet youre still almost basis points above kind of your cecl day one what do you need to see those reserves come down more meaningfully john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services mark thanks for the question so when we approach this quarter certainly the economic data was improving the portfolio is performing extremely well and the chargeoff trajectory we revised our guidance and now believe it will be below the prior year so all of those are very very positive from a reserving standpoint we did put a bit of caution in the kind of reserve numbers as a result of the various government programs that are out there so if you think about the eviction moratoriums foreclosure moratoriums various payment deferral programs and then the massive amount of government transfer payments that hit the economy we felt like that those contributed to driving delinquencies and chargeoffs below historical norms for our customer base so under cecl we reserve for life of loan and accordingly we were waiting for those programs to run their course and the cash flows to kind of feed through the economy and impact our customers and then be able to make call it a deeper change to the reserve levels so as i said earlier most of those programs ran their course in the third quarter we obviously have the child care tax theres a child tax credit we dont expect that to be an impact so in the fourth quarter we should begin to see more data that would allow us to take a different look at reserves and then into certainly our expectation is that the credit environment is very positive from a growth standpoint and accordingly well make reserves that kind of align with that mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it and then just one more question do you have any other private investments that look like they could be in a large gain position just based on any kind of subsequent funding rounds and the valuations those are done at discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so we have some investments yes we try to get in early and build out the commercial relationship as roger alluded to and were hopeful that the combination of working with quality companies and developing deeper commercial relationships will help those folks to be profitable and help us drive business in our payments area while giving us an option value for that investment so one would hope that theres more but at this point it would be way premature to speculate operator your next question comes from manu srivareerat from ubs manu srivareerat q analyst ubs securities llc good morning guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning manu srivareerat q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for taking my question i guess youve talked a lot about the benefits of having a differentiated product with flexible cash rewards now as things get back to normal and travel rewards become more relevant for consumers are you seeing any impact to your utilization levels is there any indication that consumers might have a shifting preference for travel and ph milestone rewards over cash rewards roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services weve been successfully marketing cash awards against travel rewards and every other type of card out there for decades so i wouldnt get too caught up in sort of the shift away from frequent flyer miles in i think it points to sort of the stability and structure of our program that we didnt have to make a series of changes we focus on continuously enhancing it a lot of people dont focus as much as we do on redemption so the ability to redeem at point of sale at amazon through our partner paypal so we are confident that we can compete with the travel rewards programs a lot of the miles cards really target the super prime transactors which isnt ours is much more a lendfocused model weve got a very good miles card ourselves that we market but again i feel really good that our rewards compete against anyone out there discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 manu srivareerat q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you for that and just as a followup how should we think about the rewards rate as you think about growing loan balances for example is there anything to that john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah ill cover this one so the rewards rate over time has been relatively stable its increased somewhere between bps and bps annually we expect that the programs and the reward structure will continue that trend while helping us to sustain a strong level of customer loyalty so we look at that increase as a natural evolution of a good investment in our customer relationships manu srivareerat q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you very much thanks for the color have a good day guys john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks operator your next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions mark really covered what i wanted to talk about in terms of reserves but id just like to followup on that slightly the observation was made that your reserve rate is about points higher than it would have been on day one day one was essentially an ideal economic environment low unemployment steady growth et cetera should we look at day one as a destination for where the reserve rate will go or more as a channel marker in terms of sort of an ideal operating environment john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah good question so the short answer is that it depends on the economic outlook and the portfolio performance i would say to give a kind of view on the marker when we look at the reserve rate back in call it january were at just over were at just over now that difference is about billion of reserves on the current loan book so if we have a level of confidence in the economic environment portfolio continues to be positive and the work weve done on analytics drive ill say positive credit performance there is an expectation in a benign environment that we should march back that way so i think its premature to say well get there theres a lot of discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 factors that could change but i look at that day one as a marker for a solid credit environment and a relatively strong performing credit book richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great okay thats very helpful thank you guys operator your next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning roger and john roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services hey good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc can you guys help square the continued strength in customer acquisition that you expect on one hand with payment rates remaining low for an extended period on the other you mentioned i think john the end of the pandemicrelated federal forbearance program is a somewhere is a catalyst for payment rate normalization but why do you think payment rates will remain elevated after that support has ended john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah ill start it and then maybe roger will add a couple of points on the back end so certainly if you look at frankly the projected gdp thats above normal levels for a strong us economy and thats as a result of frankly all of the activity and the transfer payments i talked about earlier i think theres a natural ill say transition from where we are today to something that approaches historical norms the savings rate is still high but its falling and so thats positive and in terms of overall sales activity versus payment rates we do expect the sales levels at some point to moderate partly because of yearoveryear comps and partly because of whats happening on economic activity but with that said i would expect that payment rate theres a bit of an inverse relationship and what were seeing from a growth standpoint is the sales activity the new account acquisition the payment rate is a bit of a headwind and then that revolve transactor rate aligning to payment rate but despite all that weve been able to grow from first quarter to second quarter so as that payment rate moderates a bit sales activity i think will be a lag to that and well be well positioned to grow in the fourth quarter and beyond discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats helpful thank you and if i may follow up on that as we look out to next year would you expect that process of that youve described in the sort of this payment rate and revolve rate normalization should that provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth such that we could actually see your loan growth start to outpace your spending growth john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services is still about six months away five to six months away so were working on it right now ill tell you this im positive in terms of how the business is positioned and what we can expect from a topline standpoint as well as credit and expense so those factors i feel very good about but to get into a level of specificity at this point its probably a bit early operator your next question is from meng jiao with deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys good morning and thanks for taking my questions i wanted to audio gap student loans as we head into third quarter its probably the first time in over a year that probably many college students are on campus i guess are you doing anything differently in terms of how youre approaching the start of this particular school year and sort of is it fair to say that marketing to students is going to be a large piece of that accelerating marketing spend that you guys have commented on roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services the third quarter is peak season for student loans but all the marketing is done before they get to campus volume was suppressed last year because for many of our customers we encourage them to take federal student loans and then use our private student loans to top off and if their expenses were lower because theyre paying tuition but not paying housing and food et cetera that had an impact on our volume on the other hand we did benefit last year from a major competitor pulling out of the marketplace so i would say were optimistic with kids going back on campus that this will be a strong year for originations and that we will continue to gain market share in the student loan product meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got you great and then secondly i think you mentioned growing confidence in ph your consumer quartertodate have you seen i guess a continued acceleration in that spending i know were roughly days into the third quarter and then secondly roger i think indiscernible are unsustainably high im just curious if you had any further color as to when you expect that to sort of normalize thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 ill start with that one i think it will take a while to normalize there is a good amount of pentup demand but also pentup liquidity in the form of the savings that have built up as well as just the open to buy that people have on their cards from sort of monthaftermonth of pretty high payment rate so i think that will provide some support on the other hand a huge amount of uncertainty in terms of what will happen with the delta variants and other factors that can drive the economy so we feel like were well positioned but unclear what the back half of the year will bring in terms of what were seeing so far this month i would say travel continues to be constructive but overall not necessarily accelerating but spend levels staying very strong operator your next question is from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i guess getting back to the bnpl is your primary kind of revenue or gross kind of opportunity in the sezzle on the lending side is that the way we should think about it roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services no you should think about it on the payment segment so transaction processing revenue and audio gap with payment processing and sort of connectivity to the merchant side and so thats sort of our first entry into buy now pay later has been more on the payment services segment as opposed to our direct banking side moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you one of the things that youve talked about in the past about buy now pay later is the question of whether it kind of encourages or discourages younger consumers from taking on a credit card and i think you had said either on the last call or one of the presentations that because of student lending brand of discover that you havent kind of seen that impact could you just talk a little bit about how you think about the value i guess of the student lending in terms of kind of and in terms of that marketing of the discover brand roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure we are very successful in the student card business i think the student loans help but also it has to do with the product the value proposition and some very good marketing and we see actually great credit performance from students because contrary to popular belief a lot of them are very responsible in how they handle their cards with student loans id start by saying we think its a great business its profitable i would say it is operationally complex but it also gets our brand out there with parents as well as students when theyre making a series of financial decisions so there are not that many banks that are in it at scale not that many too that have sort of the product set that we have to be able to leverage those relationships so its a key part of our banking strategy moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 got it and just a quick followup on the reserving point i guess i was sort of wondering if your reserves on day one included an expectation of a potential of a recession somewhere in the life of those receivables just as you think about it as we kind of enter would that be a lower probability just given the experience that weve had or is that audio gap think about it john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so when we did day one we looked at through the cycle of use so what essentially that means is we didnt look at the trough of delinquencies and chargeoffs nor did we look at peak so to extremely oversimplify it a bit of averaging with the help of a bunch of data scientists so that day one is a call it a normalized view of the credit environment operator your next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my questions and good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc i wanted to ask yeah i wanted to go back to your comment on competitive intensity and it certainly does feel like audio gap cash back cards has increased i think you alluded to intensity being a little higher than maybe the average historically so maybe just talk a little bit more about the dimensions of this competition is it spilling over beyond just higher direct rewards like the or rewards are you seeing any irrational signing bonuses introductory offers spend in three months get anything irrational are you seeing anything on the balance transfer side how is discover responding to this increased competition and is there is the increase in marketing spend in part because of this elevated competition roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so ill just start with the back half the increase in marketing spend is driven really by the opportunity we see so it is not by the competition i do expect the cost per account to be modestly higher than say levels was extraordinarily good but part of that has to do with just booking more new accounts and the marginal ones tend to be more expensive i do think some of the rewards products out there will not be sustainable longterm youve seen cash back offers come and go for a very longtime especially when we eventually get to a higher rate environment so far balance transfer demand is still a bit suppressed so were not seeing the overly long month zero percent offers discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 you are starting to see some of those high spend get type offers from some of the issuers that i think are most aggressive around growth but again nothing that i would say we havent seen before it tends to be different people at different times but this is part of the card business and what were used to competing against mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you and then i just wanted to ask about your debit product any update on that has that where are we is that being rolled out is there thoughts to expand the marketing or push behind it just any update on the debit product thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so given the excess deposits we had we really pulled back on the vast majority of our deposit marketing including that product but were very excited about the differentiation having cash back so we think were well positioned against the challenger banks as well as traditional banks and so well continue to ramp it up probably more so towards the back half of the year and as we get into mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you eric wasserstrom a vice president head of investor relations discover financial services stephanie i think we have time for one last question operator your last question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks so i just had two one is on the marketing i just wanted to make sure i understood what you meant by marketing expense anticipated return to levels are you saying that the back half of will be at a run rate similar to full year or the back half of is going to be similar to the quarterly run rate of john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so i think total year to be similar to total year of betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services that would require audio gap in the back half discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just separately on credit i know a huge debate in the group here is around payment rates and how were anticipating them to traject over the course of the next year or so one other question specifically for you is that if i recall correctly youve got a homeowner skew to your box and home prices have clearly accelerated significantly depending on the location so i know you look at your customers routinely and check how theyre doing financially are you seeing any signs of your customer base having refied and materially dropped their monthly mortgage payment requirements which would potentially keep your payment rates elevated for longer or how you think about this refi cycle and what it means for your customers and their financial health and how that translates to payment rate for you thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah we have and this cuts across past cycles we havent seen a link between sort of a refi boom and card payment rates and so i dont have any expectation that would happen this time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator i would now like to turn it back over to eric wasserstrom for closing remarks eric wasserstrom vice president head of investor relations discover financial services well thank you very much for joining us if you have any additional questions the ir team is available all day and of course whenever so thanks again and have a great day operator thank you
