closely monitoring economic developments and continue to believe we are operating from a position of strength as we head into the fourth quarter and now on to slide first the performance in the third quarter was exceptional with our third consecutive quarter of record ppnr loan growth continued to be broadbased and combined with the benefit from higher interest rates net interest income again expanded at a doubledigit rate from the prior quarter and fee income also expanded sequentially as a result of these factors adjusted ppnr increased by in the quarter this performance was driven by execution of our revenueproducing initiatives and reflected our continued disciplined expense management second we delivered another quarter of sequential growth in average deposits driven by commercial third we were pleased to drive doubledigit annualized loan growth again this quarter with this robust loan momentum and continued pipeline strength we are optimizing asset growth at the margin to maximize the return profile as we enter the fourth quarter fourth we are increasing our revenue and profitability guidance to incorporate the recent rate curve outlook zach will provide you with more details on that later finally we are positioned very well for potential economic uncertainty with balance sheet strength including higher capital levels and a reserve profile that is near the top of the peer group additionally our profitability and return on capital outlook is expected to continue to support further building capital ratios this places huntington in a position of strength with an outlook that will continue to be guided by our disciplined approach to customer selection and our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite through the cycle on slide let me share more details on our third quarter performance as i mentioned earlier we reported record net income which reflects our earnings power and ability to generate sustained top tier returns weve positioned the company to benefit from higher interest rates with their asset sensitivity and we continue to grow our fee income businesses this level of robust revenue supports our continued investment in key strategic initiatives which will sustain growth importantly we remain committed to our disciplined expense management and guided by our commitment to positive operating leverage finally as weve previously delivered on the tcf integration program and cost savings we remain focused on driving the incremental revenue opportunities from the acquisition let me provide a few updates on our progress to date weve added over revenueproducing colleagues in minnesota and colorado to support wealth management business banking middle market and specialty banking the commercial teams in the twin cities and denver are continuing to gain traction adding new customers and building pipelines in addition to the expanding middle market teams we are seeing accelerated loan growth in huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 some of our specialty areas such as health care and assetbased lending where we have recently closed a handful of sizable new relationships in colorado as a function of our expertise and local presence we are also driving increased productivity from the acquired branches where we have grown primary banking relationships nearly every month since conversion we believe this demonstrates relationship deepening and a positive reception to huntington product offerings our business banking expansion in minnesota and colorado is also showing substantial momentum were pleased to have already achieved a top three ranking or better for sba lending which were startups in both markets the launch of wealth management in the twin cities continues to track better than our initial projections the team has been fully built out and we are pleased with the caliber of talent we were able to add in this market while its still early the team is already contributing to relationship growth building pipelines reflect a significant customer opportunity even against a difficult market backdrop based on early successes we are seeing in twin cities weve expanded the wealth management business to denver with key hires added during the third quarter in our asset finance business which includes equipment finance and distribution finance which was formerly known as inventory finance our teams continue to capitalize on the opportunities to harness the combined scale to better serve our customers the business is significantly benefiting from that scale driving increased momentum and client acquisition and deepening of existing relationships were now the fifth largest bank owned equipment finance platform in the us an increase from number seven only a year ago these initiatives are ongoing and we expect them to be a significant contributor to our growth over the longer term we look forward to our investor day next month where we can spend more time on our overall business strategies as well as how these tcf revenue synergies factor into our consolidated outlook zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our third quarter results we reported gaap and adjusted earnings per common share of return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was as you saw on slide if you were to normalize tce for the noncash accounting impact of other accumulated comprehensive income that arises from unrealized losses on our afs securities portfolio our rotce would have been we are pleased with the sustained momentum in our loan balances with total loans increasing by billion and excluding ppp loans increasing by billion total average deposits also increased billion quarterover quarter and billion yearoveryear this growth reflects the focus on primary bank relationships preprovision net revenue expanded sequentially by from last quarter to million credit quality remained strong with net chargeoffs of basis points and nonperforming assets declining to basis points slide shows our continued trajectory of ppnr expansion we expect q4 to be another strong quarter as we drive sustainable profitability and highlight the earnings power of the company supported by organic growth initiatives and harnessing the benefits from the tcf acquisition we remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive operating leverage even as we continue to invest in the business turning to slide average loan balances increased quarteroverquarter totaling billion excluding ppp total loan balances increased billion or driven by both commercial and consumer loans within huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 commercial excluding ppp average loans increased by billion or from the prior quarter these results were supported by broadbased demand across our commercial businesses that is fueling robust new production line utilization remained relatively stable during the quarter on a core ci basis while we saw higher balances within distribution finance asset finance which includes equipment finance and distribution finance contributed with balances higher by billion this included million from distribution finance during the quarter commercial real estate balances also increased by million commercial growth continued in our middle market corporate and specialty banking segments which collectively increased by million during the quarter in consumer growth was led by residential mortgage which increased by billion driven by slowing prepays and higher mix of on balance sheet loan production we also saw steady growth in our vehicle finance business turning to slide we delivered average deposit growth of billion deposit growth was led by commercial up billion this expansion reflects our initiatives to drive primary bank relationships and new customer acquisition we remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at basis points for the third quarter on slide we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and nim core and net interest income excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion increased by million or to billion net interest margin increased primarily driven by higher earning asset yields as a result of our asset sensitivity position slide highlights huntingtons deposit pricing discipline our low deposit rate relative to the third quarter of along with an improved funding profile gives us the flexibility to remain disciplined on deposit pricing for the third quarter weve started to see our average cost of deposits tick up as expected were remaining dynamic in this environment we continue to manage the portfolio at a very granular and segmented level to ensure pricing discipline and with a focus on growing the primary bank relationships that bring lower cost deposits turning to slide weve been dynamically managing the balance sheet against the volatile rate backdrop this quarter we continued to execute on our hedging strategy to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term while positioning ourselves to benefit from higher expected rates in the short term in q3 we increased our downside protection by executing a net billion of receivefixed swaps and billion of collars well be proactive in managing our downside risk while closely monitoring the rate outlook our expectation is to continue to deploy downside hedging strategies over the coming months additionally we are actively managing the securities portfolio to both capture the benefit from higher rates over time and protect tangible capital we maintained the proportion of securities and held to maturity flat during the quarter and are reinvesting securities portfolio cash flows at rates above portfolio yields moving to slide noninterest income was million up million from last quarter we drove record activity within our capital markets businesses during the quarter with revenues increasing million which includes the full quarter impact from capstone capstones deal pipeline is healthy and we expect it to contribute to additional growth in the fourth quarter we remain pleased with the client engagement we are seeing in the wealth management business with positive net asset flows yeartodate the momentum in net flows has been outweighed by marketbased changes in assets under management resulting in lower overall revenue huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 deposit service charges were also lower by million reflecting the expected million impact from fair play enhancements that were implemented in july our outlook for the impact of these fee adjustments is unchanged from prior guidance our fair play philosophy is at the center of our strategy and is directly aligned with our mission of looking out for people we believe the effect of fair play continues to be a compelling value proposition for our customers and supports sustainable growth for the bank fee revenues were also impacted this quarter by a decline in mortgage banking driven by a lower return on our msr asset and lower saleable spreads moving on to slide noninterest expense increased million from the prior quarter aligned to our prior guidance core expenses excluding notable items increased million to billion this increase was mainly driven by the full quarter impact from capstone and torana it also included additional compensation expenses related to the strong revenue and production we are seeing in and impacts from merit and day count the underlying expense run rate remains very wellcontrolled our efficiency ratio which is an outcome of our revenue drivers and expense management activities came in at on a reported basis and adjusted for notable items was for the quarter on an adjusted basis this reflects a decrease of basis points quarteroverquarter slide recaps our capital position common equity tier ended the quarter at within our targeted operating range of to as we go forward our capital priorities remain unchanged with our first priority to fund organic loan growth with the robust return on equity we are generating from our core assets we are deploying our incremental capital to fund organic growth and drive cet1 towards the middle of our target operating range by year end our tangible common equity ratio or tce declined to as a result of aoci marks on the securities portfolio recall this temporarily reduces equity as value marks are taken and then accretes back over time importantly this does not impact our regulatory capital ratios our tce ratio excluding the aoci impact increased basis points to finally our dividend yield remains well above the median in our peer group at on slide credit quality continues to perform very well as mentioned net chargeoffs were basis points for the quarter this was higher than last quarter by basis points and down basis points from the prior year our consumer and commercial portfolios continue to demonstrate stability and credit quality nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for five consecutive quarters criticized loans have reduced both from the prior quarter and prior year allowance for credit losses was up basis points to of total loans reflecting a conservative reserve posture given the heightened economic uncertainty even as our internal portfolio metrics show stability turning to slide let me update our latest forecast for q4 our guidance assumes the consensus economic outlook through year end and incorporates the rate curve as of the end of september our loan growth guidance remains unchanged at high singledigit growth rate on a yearoveryear basis we are currently tracking toward the higher end of this range as a result of balance sheet growth and the rate curve outlook we are again revising guidance higher for net interest income we now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion to be up in the high to low percentage growth rate for the fourth quarter on a yearoveryear basis in fee income we now expect it to be down low single digits for the fourth quarter on a yearoveryear basis this guidance is reduced from our prior level we continue to see encouraging trends in core strategic growth areas within fees namely our capital markets wealth and advisory and payments businesses and the prior trends we have been seeing in other major fee lines including mortgage are within expected levels the change in our guidance is related to the decision to hold on sheet the guaranteed portion of our sba loan production huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 market sale premiums for those assets have reduced and it is now more advantageous for us to hold that production on sheet in q4 as opposed to selling we will forgo an acceleration of fees this quarter but benefit from higher spread income out into and beyond we believe this is a good economic return but will cause fee recognition in q4 to be lower than prior expectations on expenses our expectation is for core expenses to be up low single digits in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter we continue to maintain tight control of underlying core expenses while also seeing some impacts from compensation driven by the strong performance and profitability we are seeing in our results given the higher earnings we now expect our tax rate to be approximately finally before we move to qa id like to end with a few key points as steve mentioned earlier our business is performing exceptionally well right now with solid momentum in the underlying drivers and expanding profitability we also continue to see strength in our customer trends where they appear to be managing through the environment well and with solid credit performance notwithstanding these clear positives we are mindful of the heightened uncertainty and risks in the environment were closely monitoring the impacts from persistently high inflation rising interest rates geopolitical instability and market volatility the cone of uncertainty around the near term economic environment has widened and the probability of a recession is increasing a bedrock part of the way we manage our business is to be dynamic to ensure we have game plans ready and are positioned to act to manage through a multitude of scenarios while sustaining top tier performance and as always we are guided by our moderate to low risk appetite through the cycle we are operating from a position of strength and we are confident in our ability to successfully manage a range of economic environments were looking forward to hosting many of you at our upcoming investor day on thursday november 10th in new york city and via webcast were excited to share more about our strategic growth objectives and our targets to continue to drive top performance and value creation over the years to come with that we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 question and answer section operator at this time well be conducting the questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you and our first question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for all the time this morning what i wanted to just dig into is how we should be thinking about momentum into from a loan growth perspective youve got accelerating growth there and youve got some nim benefits that are coming from the mix shift and i just wanted to understand the dynamic as we should be thinking about loan growth versus peak nim given particularly the hedges that youre adding thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure great question thank you this is zach ill take that i think in terms of loan growth we continue to see quite a bit of momentum as we discussed in the prepared remarks even as were taking opportunities here in the fourth quarter to optimize where were driving that incremental production for higher capital returns and so expect to see continued momentum into the fourth quarter and that will continue into notwithstanding the economic uncertainty we continue to see demand from our clients and pipelines that even as theyre pulling through are refilling and so that indicates continued momentum out into and beyond and i think as we drive that well also benefit from higher asset yields to the point of your question and that will support expanding nim here into the fourth quarter in the near term betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the hedge impact can you just talk through how we should be thinking about that as we go migrate through the next four to eight quarters zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure as it relates to hedging sort of taking a step back we purposely took a series of actions in as weve discussed to increase the asset sensitivity of the business and to benefit from higher rates and that really bore through over the course of the last several quarters just in q2 and q3 of this year basis points of total core nim expansion and theres more opportunity ahead the strategy that were working through is really based on history where if you look at the longterm history around rate cycles typically medium to longterm rates begin to fall right at the peak of the fed hiking cycle and so even as were continuing to benefit from our asset sensitivity over the course of the early part of this year we have been adding incrementally to the downside hedge protection portfolio so as to protect against potential downside rate scenarios in and beyond at this point weve completed around of that total potential capacity for hedging which based on what weve done so far would protect around to of nim in down ramp scenarios out into those years that i mentioned from here i expect it to stay asset sensitive and that will based on our expectations drive additional nim expansion into q4 even as were continuing likely to continue to add to that hedge portfolio here over the coming months staying dynamic ph watching interest rates but continuing to protect against that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 downside so the net of those things should support continued loan growth as i said and help to protect and maintain really strong levels of nim as we go forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question so zach appreciate the comments on nii into the fourth quarter so the guidance indeed looks like another stepup that the growth rate will moderate as one might expect once we are sort of done with the feds tightening cycle maybe if you can just comment or give your thoughts around ability to sustain positive nii momentum after thats all finished it sounds like certainly the volume side sounds pretty optimistic but i would just be curious to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah its a great question i think that the model will be that sustained growth rate in loans coupled with the rising in the near term and then stable nim out into the future to really drive sustained continued growth in nii on a dollar basis the trajectory around nim in is very much a function of what happens with the economy clearly and where the rate curve is trending so its i wont give you a clear guidance at this point well talk more about that as we engage in future sessions but our expectation is that will look quite good from a nim perspective and that the volume growth will really support sustained continued growth in nii r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and if i could switch gears to the expense side for a moment the cost base may be a little higher than i would have expected into the fourth quarter are the compensation pressures will those sort of i mean are those related to just the strong earnings performance for this year will that base that weve got in the fourth quarter continue into next year as well in other words are some of ph costs transitory versus ongoing zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a good question really the proportion of expenses in the third quarter that were calling out as compensationrelated are really are in fact related to the exceptionally strong levels of production and revenue and ultimately profitability were seeing in and our baseline posture for expense management at this point is to be keeping the core underlying growth of expenses very well controlled and at a low level the model as weve talked about quite a bit over time is for us to selffund investments in our strategic initiatives execution on the tcf revenue synergies and our continued technology development program by driving efficiencies in the core operating expense base of the company through scale process automation et cetera huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 an indication of that is were continuing to optimize our branch network we just announced a week or so ago another branch closures that will be implemented in the early part of next year and thats just sort of how well drive that efficiency to continue to keep expenses growing at a low level and of course drive positive offering levers as we go forward so thats the run rate that we see as we get out into and of course well provide more clear guidance as we get closer to the beginning of next year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you very much i appreciate the time zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you the next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steve zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the deposit side so in the quarter you grew average loans by billion but deposits by billion and we saw this mix shift out of noninterest bearing into brokered zach what do you see as a risk of non interest bearing outflows right talk about the funding strategy and where do you see the mix evolving to zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a really good question and so its obviously a key area of considerable focus we really like the results were seeing on the deposit side in q3 and solid execution of our strategy of driving towards primary bank relationships and operating accounts even as were staying very dynamic in really managing interest expense and the trajectory on that exceptionally closely what i expect into the fourth quarter is more of the same so i expect to see deposits grow into the fourth quarter commercial led and even as of course beta and interest expense costs are beginning now to tick up as we go into the fourth quarter its kind of taking a step back in terms of the overall funding mix to the point of your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 as we see it were starting this cycle and beginning into the early stages of it from a really solid position relative to indiscernible cycles the loan to deposit ratio is relatively low noncustomer sources of funding are also relatively low and that leaves us in a good position to leverage diversified funding sources to fund indiscernible weve got of course deposits are the core and thats why were pleased that theyre growing but we do have the opportunity to leverage shortterm and longterm other sources of funding which well do in a diversified way to balance the funding sources and to be frank to put good tension in the system to really support our disciplined approach to pricing and deposit growth over time and so thats the model that well use and i think as we go out into the future we will see that balance funding steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then to follow up so based on the ranges that youre giving for the updated fourth quarter guidance we can get to a scenario where nim is flatter even down a little bit in the quarter fourth quarter could you frame for us how much nim expansion youre thinking about for and was your answer to scotts question that you think nim could hold flattish next year is that the base case thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so i do expect to see nim expansion into the fourth quarter it wont be at the same rate that weve seen for the last couple of quarters but i do think well see that continue to expand into the fourth quarter as we go into what happens kind of over the longer term out into the back half of is really going to be a function of where we see the yield curve going and the economy as i mentioned and so you could see stability you could see some downdraft well see i think its going to be a function of those drivers with that being said our focus as i said before is really on growing net interest income on a dollar basis and i think the loan growth that were bringing through will help to sustain and support that over time steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and steve zach deserves some type of award for the way hes managed his balance sheet so far in this environment thanks for taking my questions zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you its a team effort but appreciate the recognition stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc its also early innings thank you operator the next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ph hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc zach if i could follow up on the securities book i was wondering if you could just help us understand how the pay fixedreceive variable swaps have helped the securities book noting that your yields were up basis points in that book this quarter on top of a prior basis points it just seems like youre really getting that extra juice off the securities book so can you kind of just help us understand like whats the how long does that help you for on that swap side and then what are you expecting just overall size of the book to look like going forward thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question in terms of size we think the securities portfolio is right sized with respect to the size of the balance sheet at this point its about of total assets of earning assets and i expect it to stay proportionately at the same level for the foreseeable future were essentially managing it for our liquidity as a corporation at this point in terms of yields we did see basis point increase in portfolio yield into the third quarter which was obviously very helpful for nim if i was to reconcile that for you about basis points of that basis points was from the hedge portfolio just under basis points was from the impact of new money yields coming in during the quarter and the remainder of roughly basis points was driven by a reduction in premium amortization i expect that well continue to see rising yields out of the securities portfolio partly as a function of that just continued reduction in premium amort the hedge portfolio should continue to benefit us as well as the rate curve has ticked up just a bit incrementally from the end of the third quarter here and new money yields are pretty attractive relative to existing portfolio yield to give you a sense team is currently investing somewhere between and yields here as we enter october so that will continue to be accretive to yield as we go forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and just a followup ill ask indiscernible on that then zach that basis points held like how long is that helper in that part of the portfolio the swaps on the securities book how long does that carry forward for zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc it will continue to carry forward for a while here the tenor of those are multiple years and so we obviously have to see where the trajectory of the yield curve goes to the extent that they drive incremental benefit on a quarter basis but they will protect us for some time to come to the extent rates keep rising ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay thank you zach huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you the next question is from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey steve or rich can you talk a little bit about how youre balancing growth with i think steve your comment was potential economic uncertainty your numbers look clean but you did have a higher provision and you took your reserves up a little bit so talk a little bit about credit and rich maybe give us some help on what youre thinking on provision in reserves stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc let me start and ill turn it over to rich jon thanks for the question first of all credit was really good again this quarter and we feel very very good about our position we talked about it internally being a strong position that were playing from and youll hear us occasionally reference it externally as well balanced book balanced portfolio lot of discipline about aggregate moderate to low risk appetite over many years youve seen our credit metrics quarteroverquarter on the consumer side super prime were feeling obviously were feeling very good about it obviously were working it diligently theres a lot of portfolio review theres very active portfolio management underway constantly and the teams are doing a great job so now that i stole most of richs thunder let me turn it over to rich richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i was going to say theres not a whole lot to add there but as steve mentioned and the credit looks really good with basis points of chargeoffs for the year and ph credit class and npas are both trending down for several quarters with respect to the increase in the reserve coverage i mean the allowance went up by million in the quarter and most of that was coming from loan growth so weve taken this consistently prudent approach to our acl since covid hit in and we think that we got a good position of strength right now heading into a possible downturn as it relates to how were managing the growth versus where we are in the cycle i mean we are fundamentally laserfocused on client selection and we underwrite our clients at all times to how do they perform through the cycle and clearly with one coming up potentially were paying heightened attention to that but were always sensitizing for higher rates for stress with inflation and other variables as we underwrite our credits and thats not huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 changing so we feel that we can grow the balance sheet and grow it prudently and well move forward from there so we feel good about where we are jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay just as a followup on client selection your comment can you talk a little bit about the consumer as well i mean your numbers are incredibly clean but are you expecting some deterioration there over time or just give us your overall thoughts there rich richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah we are expecting it and really when you talk about deterioration i mean you are coming off a very low base right with all the stimulus money that came into the system in and into the levels of delinquencies and the level of chargeoffs are really unsustainable so what were looking at is more of a return to normal were closely watching the early stage delinquencies and theyre exactly where we thought they would be i mean they are up off of those historic lows but if you go back and you look at where delinquencies would have been in and were not at those more normal levels and with respect to chargeoffs weve had net recoveries in many of our consumer portfolios in the first second and even into the third quarter and we do expect over time that those are going to return to the norm but right now we feel very good about where the consumer book is positioned jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions the next question is coming from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i guess just following up on the last question first specifically on indirect auto i mean were seeing some pockets of i guess stressnormalization elsewhere i think your mix is a lot different indiscernible so much higher quality youve been so consistent obviously you have just like million of losses but specifically there can you talk about what youre seeing and if theres any changes that youre making either on the origination side or i guess were hearing about collections being tricky as well thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey matt its rich ill take that so weve been in this business for years and weve been through all sorts of cycles and as you know our model was one of focusing on prime and super prime customers and one of the benefits that weve developed over time is the ability to put in highly predictive custom scorecards with response to default expectations so were underwriting to not getting the car back in the first place and we are mindful of the fact that used car prices are coming down and we build that into our decisioning if you look on slide of the earnings deck youll see that while were maintaining really strong ficos and custom scorecard ratings our ltvs have come down steadily since the third quarter of and so weve got a very disciplined and sophisticated underwriting approach and the fact that were i think prudently bringing the ltvs down over time speaks well to huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 how the book is going to perform its a core competency of the bank we expect the chargeoffs to return to normal but for right now were enjoying what we think is a really strong core competency that we bring to that end of the business zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc even the normal matt is on a comparative basis to the industry just excellent so we underwrite for roughly bps of loss and obviously were not seeing that now matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just separately do you care to give us maybe a seconds kind of preview of the investor day in terms of what youre looking to accomplish you talked about strategic update and financial targets but anything you want to give us a little preview of thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure this is zach ill take that one thanks for serving up that question we are really excited about the opportunity to engage on november thursday in new york city and via webcast for investor day weve got quite a robust agenda planned well go through each of our major business lines each of our key functions like credit and risk management and human resources and well share kind of an overview not only of the strategy generally but also what our updated long term expectations are for financial performance and kind of the roadmap for us to get there so its going to be a robust discussion and i think will serve as a great launching off point for a series of additional conversations thereafter so really excited about it and look forward to three weeks from now matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay

bancshares inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question was for steve and steve i was laughing at your response to steves alexopoulos comment it was classic your efficiency ratio medium term target is and obviously with the help of the business strength and rates you went down to in the quarter and im wondering if the medium term range still holds in that youll look to continue to reinvest back in the business especially as rates are helping the denominator side of that equation stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc erika if we could defer that question to investor day i would be very pleased but i also very much appreciate the inquiry erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it i tried stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc you certainly did erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc second question is a follow up for zach im going to ask this question another way i think it was i saw it as an accomplishment that your period end deposits grew and you kept your cost of deposit to bps well below where i think everybody was expecting you to go so as we think about your outlook for good loan growth and some nii growth next year how should we think about deposit growth from here fully understand your message that you never got to search deposits in the first place but how should we think about core deposit growth outside of mix shift and additionally how youre thinking about the terminal deposit beta from here zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure its a great question erika let me see if i can expand on some of that so in terms of deposits our expectation is to grow core deposits into the fourth quarter as i mentioned earlier commercial just continues to perform very well i think were really benefiting from all of the investments that weve made to expand the strength of the team and expertise and capabilities not to mention the boost around tcf synergies which are really contributing and so that will be the core driver into q4 whats interesting on the consumer side i do huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 expect to see some continued downdraft in consumer core into the fourth quarter but actually pretty encouraging underlying trends whats happening in consumer is a bit of a tale of two cities where the underlying trend in customer acquisition household acquisition and primary bank relationship growth and the deepening efforts that weve got both in our offline channels and increasingly now on the digital channels are really working and were seeing nice expanding deposit gathering from those activities whats offsetting that is the welldocumented phenomenon of the elevated level of savings and socalled surge deposits from the covid era are running down and the net of those two things has been a modest reduction over the last several quarters i expect that to continue into the fourth quarter before the surge balance downdrafts sort of start to wane and the underlying growth that were seeing in that core activity within consumer start to come to the fore and so were encouraged about the longer term trends in consumer and as i look out over the period i expect to see deposit growth well continue to see commercial probably growing faster but what consumer contributing with net positive growth as relates to beta well see i think were pretty sanguine on this point that weve seen low deposit beta thus far and i think thats been shared very much across the industry and a number of the peers have seen that through the third quarter the market is becoming more active as i said earlier in the back half of q3 and continuing now into q4 so i expect to see beta rising in the fourth quarter its kind of as we expected so not overly different than what we have been planning for all along but that is trending and where it ultimately goes in my opinion is a bit theoretical everything continues to track generally to our plan thus far but where were focused is on our strategy drive the primary bank and operating account relationships stay very rigorous in terms of the detailed management and very dynamic in watching the market and ultimately ensure that we can keep supporting our customers and growing those relationships which so far has been working and thats what well keep doing erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks see you in three weeks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer
