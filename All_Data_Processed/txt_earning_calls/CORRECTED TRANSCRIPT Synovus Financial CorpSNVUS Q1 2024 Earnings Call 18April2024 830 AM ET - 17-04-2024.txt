president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jennifer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call our first quarter results demonstrate tangible progress on the strategic priorities that we have outlined for you over the last several quarters synovus produced steady loan growth in key commercial categories such as middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty ci as well as continued rationalization in loan portfolios where we have less meaningful deposit or fee relationships we generated core deposit growth in a seasonally weaker quarter and are seeing improving trends in noninterestbearing deposit diminishment as well as continued contraction in higher cost brokered deposits core and noninterest revenue categories continue to grow on a yearoveryear basis while operating expense control remains disciplined with investments in key areas continuing while keeping total expenses roughly flat our quarterly loan losses remain stable and our balance sheet continues to strengthen with further improvement in key safety and soundness metrics highlighted by lower wholesale funding and higher capital ratios our financial success is a direct result of how well we are meeting the needs and expectations of our clients through trusted advice and valued service in that regard synovus and our talented team members continue to be nationally recognized for service excellence we are extremely proud to report that synovus recently received greenwich awards for our performance serving small businesses and middle market clients we earned the fourth highest number of total synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 awards among the over banks that were evaluated we also continue to perform very well against our southeastern peers in the recently released jd power survey for consumer client satisfaction and trust our grow the bank initiative continued to gain traction in the first quarter as we finalized our new greensky program expanded our middle market banker team built our largest cib pipeline todate generated over new relationships from our business owner wealth strategy grew wealth aum by yearoveryear added a new commodities hedging capability and expanded existing relationships with approximately of our treasury sales to existing clients speaking of our treasury and payment solutions team we are excited to introduce a differentiated new solution called accelerate pay which alleviates administrative burdens faced by accounts payable staff and seamlessly integrates into existing workflows providing an immediate return on investment for our clients we launched this new capability earlier this month and the pipeline has been building steadily since the announcement lastly we have a long successful track record in community banking this quarter our community bank generated core deposit growth of almost million and our consumer bank produced growth of approximately million our longstanding wellpositioned core businesses continue to drive growth through a value relationship approach allowing us to invest in new sources of revenue and future growth now lets move to slide for the quarterly financial highlights synovus reported first quarter diluted eps of and adjusted eps of however a million incremental fdic special assessment reduced our reported and adjusted first quarter eps by following a million or eps impact from the initial special assessment in the prior quarter as previously mentioned we generated healthy and consistent loan growth in our highpriority commercial business lines including middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lending with these categories up annualized however periodend loan growth was flat in the first quarter due to flat line utilization commercial real estate and senior housing paydowns and payoffs and strategic loan portfolio rationalization efforts despite seasonal headwinds our core deposits grew modestly in the first quarter the team remains highly focused on accelerating core funding generation through sales activities and product expansion which led to an increase in deposit production of roughly million versus the fourth quarter and at a rate that was approximately basis points lower januarys noninterestbearing deposit decline was impacted by seasonality but deposit flows improved throughout the course of the quarter with a million increase in the month of march given the strength of our core deposit growth we reduced brokered deposits for the third consecutive quarter looking at noninterest revenue we experienced yearoveryear growth in key categories including treasury and payment solutions and our commercial sponsorship lines of business however total adjusted noninterest revenue declined modestly from a year ago primarily driven by lower service charges and wealth management income as a result of the consumer checking modifications and third quarter globalt divestiture also capital markets income was lower relative to more elevated levels experienced in the first quarter of given the strong correlation to loan production cost initiatives as well as ongoing diligence has led to flattish overall core expense growth yearoveryear while maintaining a level of strategic investments that positioned synovus well from a competitive standpoint in order to drive longterm shareholder value on the asset quality front credit losses were stable with previous quarters lastly given continued economic uncertainty we further bolstered our common equity tier ratio in the first quarter through solid earnings accretion and balance sheet management while completing a measured amount synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 of opportunistic share repurchases common equity tier levels are the highest in over eight years and currently sits in the upperhalf of our stated range of to now ill turn it over to jamie to cover the first quarter results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin as you can see on slide total loan balances were essentially stable on a linked quarter basis as expected our loan growth was muted as key strategic business lines saw growth which was offset by balance sheet optimization efforts and transactionrelated decline consistent with our focus on core client relationships growth in middle market commercial cib and specialty lines was million during the first quarter there is increased strength in the commercial real estate and senior housing markets as evidenced by higher levels of transaction activity over the last two quarters due to property sales and refinancing we expect this increased transaction activity to result in declines in these portfolios throughout we also continue to strategically reduce our nonrelationship syndicated lending and thirdparty consumer loan portfolios in the first quarter further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth consistent with our overall balance sheet strategy we continue to prioritize clients with meaningful deposit and noninterest revenue relationships while rationalizing growth in creditonly lending areas such as syndicated lending and thirdparty consumer lending that have a lower return profile or dont meet our strategic relationship objective our organic balance sheet optimization efforts will continue as we focus on balanced loan and core deposit growth turning to slide core deposit balances grew million sequentially during the first quarter the community bank and the consumer bank saw strong growth while seasonality contributed to a decline in deposits in the wholesale bank as we look to the remainder of the year growth from the wholesale bank and continued execution within our consumer and community segments should support core deposit growth within our previously stated guidance range client demand for time deposits remained elevated during the first quarter this growth combined with our continued remixing of noninterestbearing deposits pushed total deposit costs higher during the quarter we are encouraged by trends in noninterestbearing bearing as the million decline in january was followed by a significantly less contraction in february and million of growth in march brokered deposits declined million or from the fourth quarter which was the third consecutive quarter of contraction we expect further declines in brokered deposits in the coming quarters as we look at funding cost the aforementioned trends resulted in our total cost of deposits increasing by basis points to in the first quarter for the month of march total deposit costs was versus in december our cycle todate total deposit beta in march was versus in december moving to slide net interest income was million in the first quarter which represented a decline of from the fourth quarter the primary factors contributing to this decline included a lower day count which impacted spread revenue by approximately million a modest decline in loan balances and earning assets and further cost increases within our core interestbearing deposit portfolio deposit mix also impacted our margin for the quarter though as we mentioned trends later in the first quarter were somewhat more constructive than the averages for the quarter net interest margin ended the quarter at a sequential decline of basis points as the benefits of higher rates on newer production fixed rate asset repricing and the partial securities repositioning in the fourth quarter were more than offset by the core deposit mix trends and deposit cost increase as we look forward to the second quarter we expect relative stability in the net interest margin synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 slide shows total reported noninterest revenue of million in the first quarter adjusted noninterest revenue was million and declined million or from the previous quarter and was down million or yearoveryear on a sequential basis commercial sponsorship income declined by million primarily related to a decline in back bookrelated greensky fees we expect relatively stable quarterly commercial sponsorship fees for the remainder of the year boli revenue was also elevated in the fourth quarter impacting the quarteroverquarter comparison these declines were partially offset by higher mortgage wealth management and capital markets fees when looking at the yearago quarter core banking fees increased driven by treasury and payment solutions fee growth of approximately as well as the impact of our second quarter qualpay investment also other noninterest revenue increased sharply yearoveryear primarily from the expanded greensky relationship these tailwinds were offset as a result of the consumer checking modifications implemented last year also wealth management income was down yearoveryear due to the globalt divestiture in the third quarter of despite a slower first quarter for capital marketsrelated income we expect capital markets growth in led by our middle market and cib business lines we continue to invest in core noninterest revenue streams that deepen client relationships such as treasury and payments solutions capital markets and wealth management which have demonstrated healthy growth over the past few years moving to expense slide highlights our operating cost discipline reported and adjusted noninterest expense was impacted by a million incremental fdic special assessment the total impact of the two special assessments was million including the initial million recognized in the fourth quarter reported non interest expense was million and adjusted noninterest expense of million was down million or from the prior quarter adjusted noninterest expense increased million or yearoveryear which was almost entirely driven by the million incremental fdic special assessment incurred in the first quarter employment expense was down yearoveryear benefited by our head count reductions made over the past three quarters seasonally higher employment expense inflated noninterest expense by approximately million in the first quarter which impacted earnings by an estimated importantly we will remain proactive with disciplined expense management in this revenuechallenged environment as a result adjusted noninterest expense should be relatively flat in excluding the fdic special assessments imposed in the fourth quarter and the first quarter moving to slides and on credit quality our allowance for credit losses ended the first quarter at million or up from million or in the fourth quarter consistent with the prior quarters we continue to raise the allowance to reflect asset valuations credit migration trends and a heavier weighting toward downside economic scenario net chargeoffs in the first quarter were million or basis points compared to basis points in the fourth quarter and basis points in the third quarter which excluded the loan sales the nonperforming loan ratio increased to of loans as credit metrics migrate from historically low levels total criticized and classified credits rose slightly but remain at very manageable levels first quarter net charge offs and credit metrics were impacted by one particular commercial and industrial credit which accounted for basis points of net chargeoffs and is expected to be resolved later this month we have a high degree of confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio and we will continue to reduce our nonrelationship credits and manage the portfolio with a heightened level of diligence in this more uncertain macroeconomic environment as seen on slide our capital position continued to increase in the first quarter with the preliminary common equity tier ratio reaching and with total riskbased capital now at retained earnings supported synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 capital accretion in the first quarter additionally our efforts to rationalize growth within certain segments resulted in a modest decline in riskweighted assets which further supported the increase in our capital ratios against this backdrop we executed about million of common stock repurchases in the first quarter which equates to approximately basis points of capital we will continue to target a cet1 ratio within a range of and and aim to maintain a robust capital position against what remains an uncertain macroeconomic environment looking into the second quarter we would note that our riskweighted asset optimization is currently underway that is expected to result in a subset of our loan portfolio being eligible for a reduced risk weighting when completed this should support our capital ratios and provide flexibility for incremental capital deployment this incremental capital deployment is contingent upon the analysis and documentation of the eligibility of certain loan portfolios for reduced risk weighting we will share further details on the results of this exercise over the near term finally on april we reclassified billion of our securities portfolio from availableforsale to heldtomaturity this reclassification will reduce the interest rate sensitivity within aoci and thus the variability of our tangible common equity ratio ill now turn it back to kevin to discuss our guidance kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie ill now continue with our updated fundamental guidance for the remainder of based on first quarter experience and our existing pipelines periodend loan growth is still expected to be to in growth should be supported by the continued success in middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lines offset by rationalization in nonrelationship credits and commercial real estate and senior housing payoff and paydown activity our current forecast for core deposits indicates growth within a to range for the year aided by seasonal tailwinds as the year progresses and new core funding growth initiatives with the last fomc rate increase now having occurred roughly nine months ago we believe deposit costs are in the process of stabilizing and with some residual upward pressure remaining into the second quarter should result in a peak total deposit beta for the cycle between and under this forecast for deposit cost our current outlook points to the revenue growth at the lowend of our negative to range largely impacted by the continued deposit remixing that we and the industry are experiencing our forecast is based upon a stable interest rate environment and does not include any potential benefits from the ongoing riskweighted asset optimization exercise net interest income should improve in the secondhalf of this year as fixed rate asset repricing overcomes deposit repricing and remixing noninterest revenues should experience growth this year as pipelines for capital marketsrelated fees remain strong we continue to execute on our core growth and treasury and payment solutions and the new greensky forwardflow program continues to build our adjusted noninterest expense growth guidance is unchanged after adjusting for the impact of the first quarter fdic special assessment excluding the special assessments in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of we anticipate our adjusted noninterest expense will be relatively stable this year we continue to closely monitor and manage our loan portfolio to uncover any credit deterioration or systemic themes across industry and geography we expect the firsthalf of the year net chargeoffs to continue to be relatively stable at approximately basis points given current credit migration trends assuming a relatively stable economic environment and considering the impact of certain large individual losses we expect net chargeoffs to be flat to down in the secondhalf of the year synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 moving to the tax rate our current forecast points to the upperhalf of our to range finally our common equity tier ratio is at the highend of our target range of to and we will remain opportunistic with measured amounts of share repurchases to manage capital levels prudent capital management remains our top priority to ensure we have strong and liquid balance sheet for all economic environments through the actions we have taken over the past several quarters synovus is wellpositioned to meet the needs of our clients while operating from a position of strength amid this evolving economic landscape we are focused on growing the bank through the expansion of relationships and the delivery of new sources of revenue all while improving returns and building an even more riskresilient bank and now operator this concludes our prepared remarks lets open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you well now begin the questionandanswer section operator instructions the first question is from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jon kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey kevin if i can try to get you offscript a little bit if i can stocks off a little bit this morning i would say its been a battleground in terms of feedback and i think the quarter looks okay to me maybe soft in a couple of areas fine in others some positive trends also emerging but curious how you see it maybe a chance to defend your stock a little bit how do you see the putsandtakes of the quarter where do you think you need to do better what do you think is going well just curious on your thoughts to start the call kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah jon look i love the question because i think thats whats on my mind you look at a lot of the information we provided today it really comes down to two areas margin and credit because when you look at our expenses and you look at fee income i think we continue to meet and exceed our expectations there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 so lets dig in a little bit first on margin were off basis points this quarter and that is largely a function of deposits and that was higher than what we had modeled so when you look at what caused it it was fairly evenly split between our noninterest bearing decline our interestbearing nonmaturity deposit cost increases and a little more cd remixing and i dont want to get into the weeds around each of those because we could spend the rest of the call but i expect those trends to improve and as we look at some of the things that weve already done as well as some of the trends that weve seen this quarter which would include some positive trends around dda i think those headwinds on the margins will abate and as jamie said in the prepared remarks we would expect this quarter to be flat and then as youll hear later there are some things that we have in place both from the fixed asset repricing but also some of these trends changing that will allow us to expand our margin by to basis points by yearend getting us right back to the that we shared back in january and that obviously assumes flat rates that does not include any impact of any of the potential use of any capital that we would realize as part of this riskweighted asset optimization exercise so quarter was down more contraction than we thought i think we have a path to expansion and one thats very similar to what we talked about back in january now on to the credit front we had stable net chargeoffs this quarter including one very large credit that has since been resolved and that credit really impacted our credit metrics this quarter basis points of our charge offs and it also represented basis points of our increase in npls having resolved this credit this month that will ultimately result in a commensurate decline in npls meaning that without that credit npls would have actually declined this quarter and maybe whats most important is what i just said there at the end which was we expect our net chargeoffs to be flat to down in the secondhalf of the year based upon our portfolio metrics and trends now some have probably questioned how can that be given some of the metrics well one of the things that we did this quarter we initiated a deep dive through our entire multifamily portfolio very similar to what we did last year in office and similar to what we did with the hospitality industry back in covid and that led to a downgrade of four credits which totaled right around million so that deep dive represented of the basis point increase in our criticized and classified ratio also on the provision front given what weve seen on valuation across all asset classes this quarter we added a qualitative adjustment to the allowance of just under million to account for higher loss given default if we were to see any sort of defaults on the cre side without that adjustment our allowance would have actually declined quarteronquarter and ill just remind you that our cre portfolio continues to perform very well we have an npl ratio of basis points and we only had million of npl inflows this quarter so when i look at everything in totality and i think about the two areas that probably had some softness to your point i look at the stability and improvement in those areas and when i couple that with our expense discipline and our increased forecast for fee income and then you add on top of that the potential to have incremental capital from our riskweighted asset optimization i feel like our opportunities in the forecast outweigh those of the risk jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good yeah those are the issues its credit and margin so appreciate that kevin and then just to follow up quickly jamie for you kevin just mentioned it but what do you need to do for the rwa optimization efforts who needs to bless it when could it happen and how much capital do you think it could free up thank you synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jon thanks for the question hey look youre aware weve been working on improving our roe for multiple years and recently we put a lot of effort into our review of what is consuming our riskweighted assets weve been looking at real estate line ci unfunded commitments and general kind of return for every dollar of riskweighted assets that we put on the books some of these strategies affect our gotomarket strategy some of them affect what we do as far as our inorganic strategies like the sale of business lines that we did in but the effort were talking about today is around certain loan categories that could be eligible to have reduced risk weighting including mortgage government lending securitization exposures and multifamily term loans the largest impact of this effort is coming from loans that qualify for a reduced rwa treatment within our lender finance portfolio but in order to achieve that risk weighting down to in many cases relative to the risk weighting we have today we have to perform proper analysis and documentation in light of the regulatory capital requirements under the simplified supervisory formula approach and unfortunately we havent completed that effort so we cannot give specific details on the impact of capital ratios but as we said in the prepared remarks as we show in the deck we believe it could be meaningful given what we have completed todate we think the impact could be billion or more reduction to riskweighted assets and the impact to cap ratios could be greater than basis points so if we successfully complete this work and given where we are with capital were already at the higher end of our range and thats our intent is to stay at the higher end of our target range and so well likely deploy this capital any capital generated from this when its completed to either securities repositioning or share repurchases and kind of try to maintain our capital ratios at the given level we say you asked about what could this be and we feel confident about the billion or more comment the upside is probably around billion and so we have work to do but we do expect to complete it in the near term and well report back once we get further along jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good thank you very much andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks jon operator thank you the next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 yeah so i guess just following up on nii and the nim outlook so you always had this expectation around no rate cuts in your guidance so im trying to think through around whats changed versus whats not changed can you talk about the pricing competition in your markets like we had one of your peers reported yesterday talked about a significant pickup in pricing competition on deposits in the southeast markets are you seeing the same thing and just the level of visibility around nib mix and the peak deposit beta that you called out in the slide deck thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp ebrahim as we talked about in the past i dont think the pricing competition is going to abate i mean everyones in the market for liquidity and as an industry we traditionally use price to attract new deposits and so we havent seen a big change there we also havent seen any of the competitive data to suggest that rates are going higher as a matter of fact when we look at our production this quarter for new deposits we actually declined about basis points and so weve kept our rates roughly the same and that has left us in a competitive position roughly in the same place our production was up about quarteronquarter so i wouldnt suggest to you that theres a big change in the competitive landscape i think its always very competitive and were looking for ways to position ourselves not just with rate but other ways to win new deposits but i havent really seen a big change in the pricing backdrop jamie do you want talk a little about nib and how we think about that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim let me just speak to the first quarter going to the second quarter because this is the inflection point right we had basis points of deposit cost increase in the first quarter and obviously given our margin outlook we expect that to abate in the second quarter so lets kind of go through the components and in the first quarter the driver of margin compression on the liability side was nib declines and then increased interest bearing cost and when you think about those individually for noninterestbearing deposits as we showed on slide the trends there are positive and we had a january where we saw a large amount of attrition in that portfolio but then we saw stabilization in february and growth in march and we expect the stabilization to continue in nib given the change in trends now to be clear we expect nib as a percent of total deposits to decline as we head through yearend but we think that that pressure will be much more moderate than what we saw early in the year when you think about interestbearing deposits the pressure on the first quarter call was driven by increases in each category of now money market and cds when you look at the nonmaturity deposits on money market deposits the average rate of money markets for us has been flat since december when you look at the now account the average rate of now accounts has been flat since january so were seeing stability in these portfolios now time deposits do continue to creep up due to production being higher than the rollingoff rate of time deposits and the growth in the portfolio but what id say about that is when you look at the second quarter we have billion of maturities in time deposits and our new and renewed rate on time deposits in the first quarter was right at i mean so we have billion maturing at and are going on new production in the first quarter for new and renewed is so very similar so thats just going to we expect that to be reduced pressure going forward to the cost of interestbearing deposits and so combination of all of those things on the liability side along with a normalization of loan fees less interest reversal and the residual benefit of the first quarter hedge maturities give us confidence in the second quarter margin which is the launching point for margin expansion in the secondhalf of the year synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color so thank you for walking through all of that and just separately on credit also so we build reserves has your macro view changed in terms of what youre seeing in the markets today for the economy for the credit book today versus back in jan or is this result based essentially just putting aside some money being conservative im trying to get a sense of are you seeing signs within the portfolio that imply a little bit more worsening than you expected a few months ago andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ebrahim no no we are not and matter of fact when you think about the general macro economy were actually seeing general improvement in the outlook there and you can see that in our waterfall and the change in the allowance you can see that that pushed towards a reduction in the allowance this quarter and as kevin mentioned earlier the performance was really the deep dive we did on multifamily now just to be clear as he mentioned we havent seen a degradation in the quality of that portfolio but what we have done is just increased the allowance based on what were seeing out there with valuations with office occupancy just out of prudence and so the allowance increase you see is based on that youll see an increase in the allowance associated with cre due to that move we have increased the allowance to loan ratio in cre about basis points in this quarter and so but again thats indicative of the environment more than the performance of the portfolio ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just on that multifamily deep dive we downgraded four loans anything else i mean theres obviously a lot of chatter about supply coming on over the next year or two so im assuming you kind of worked through that and the four loans that you downgraded is all you kind of identified as having any signs of weakness robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey ebrahim its bob thanks for the question yeah just as kevin mentioned those four credits were downgraded to what we would classify as a special mention status just based on interest rate stress as it relates to coverage we have great sponsors there we dont see really any significant loss content more just getting making sure we had the classification right and again it was just four multifamily loans that moved to special mention but nothing changed in terms of our outlook for any kind of loss content relative to multifamily and we still feel like yes theres some supply issues in pockets in certain markets but again from our perspective theres a lot of equity in these projects rent increases have been going strong for a few years theyre settling now and actually retracting a little bit but theres a fair amount of cushion in these projects and certainly the demand is still there relative to housing singlefamily housing constraints kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and ebrahim ill just reference slide in the appendix where we give you a little more detail on the entire multi family portfolio including the fact that of it is student housing again very low ltv performing at a very high level npl ratios of only basis points so the deep dive as bob said weve done in other asset classes just to synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 get that look and your question was did you find anything else obviously if we had found anything else you would have seen greater risk migration ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you for taking my questions andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you ebrahim operator thank you the next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so looking at the outlook slide its based on flat rates from current levels and im curious i know the forward curve is changing by the minute but assuming the current one does play out and we did get two cuts or something in that range do you still think we would see this nim expansion to bps in the secondhalf of the year and are you still in this adjusted revenue growth range if we do get those cuts andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah i mean the simple answer to that is and to your point the forward curve changes all the time which is why we gave our guidance to flat rates why we did it in january as well but when we look out there what we would say is during an easing cycle we do expect to see margin pressure we remain relatively neutral to the front of the curve so we do expect once deposit cost stabilize to be at a similar spot when we come out of the easing cycle as we were going in but during the cycle we would expect somewhere between and basis points impact to the margin but with the forward curve to your question on the fullyear revenue we think that the forward curve given where it is today would be less than impact on revenue for synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got it so you wouldnt see that nim expansion and youd be below the lowend of the range if we did get cuts jamie thats what youre saying not materially ph but it could be below andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp it would be less than a impact it depends yeah we gave guidance steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp to the lowend of the range but itd be less than kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp again steve and thats before steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp we would do anything with the riskweighted asset thats just based on the current baseline forecast steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it yeah okay and then on this large ci credits that you guys called out i believe you said a couple of times it was resolved now does that mean that npas associated with this just go away in or does that also mean that maybe youre getting recovery on that loan what does resolve mean robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey steve its bob it resolved through bankruptcy we took the chargeoff this quarter the npl obviously it stayed into the second quarter but its been refinanced and resolved so yes that npl should go away steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 ph it wont come out got it okay thanks and then kevin i had a big picture question so i loved reading your annual report where you talked about this grow the bank mantra right in the shareholder letter again when i look at this year i get why expenses are flat because the revenue environment is pretty tough but when i looked in your markets right i mean most banks would be very envious of your markets how do you think about this balance of investing enough to really take advantage of the growth potential in your markets and as the environment improves do we expect this pace of investments to improve because honestly your loan growth is not much different than banks that really have a much worse footprint than you have just wondering when do we start to see synovus deliver growth thats really commensurate with the great markets that youre in thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp look steven its the question that we wrestle with every day in terms of investments is how much do you spend today for longterm shareholder value and we are leaning in behind the scenes were at zero for this year but were still adding team members in our commercial area our private wealth area were investing in technology and you never spend enough you always want to spend a little more we take a very financial approach to how we look at investments in terms of earnback period and whether thats adding a new resource or adding a technology we look at how long it takes for that investment to pay back and we continue to keep a very regiment approach to doing that but as revenue grows were going to increase the level of spend we want to make sure positive operating leverage for us is less about something were trying to do i just think its good stewardship for shareholders we want to invest as much as we can as presented by the revenue growth that we have so yes as revenue improves in and youll see us invest more and i couldnt agree with you more we have a real opportunity in the southeast not just because of the demographic shifts but as weve said you look at our jd power survey you look at our greenwich survey our clients tell us that we serve them better than our competitors and in that case we should not only get the benefit of the growth of the southeast but we should get higher market share growth by taking clients from our competitors so yes we want to continue to invest prudently we do use revenue growth as a calibrator on how much were willing to spend as margin starts to expand as the economy provides us more growth well spend more money and lastly just on the loan growth side i think in our loan slide youll see that the areas that we continue to invest in we are growing we are up annualized in middle market cib and specialty but because weve been rightsizing the balance sheet weve been downplaying our shared national credits as well as senior housing which has had a fairly big headwind on loan growth and weve seen some more constructive activity on cre that allows us to see some payoff activities that we havent seen for some time so as we get to a more normalized level on shared national credits and senior housing and we get our pipeline start to build again on cre when you add in the strategic growth youre going to see that loan growth go back to levels that are far higher than they are today and ones that i think you would point to as being higher growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect thanks for taking my questions synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you steve operator thank you the next question is from the line of catherine mealor with kbw catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc kevin you talked last quarter about a ppnr growth rate from fourth quarter to fourth quarter of being about to and as we think about your revised guidance kind of the lower end of the revenue range it feels like nii is inflecting but a little softer is there enough in what youre seeing in fees and expenses to still get to that to ppnr rate or is the nim and rate environment eating into that a little bit to where that high singledigit growth rate is really going to be more of a event kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp this decline in margin this quarter kind of delays that sort of high singledigit ppnr growth maybe into a little bit based on this forecast but as jamie said we have a lot of levers were working on right now that would allow us to potentially increase our forecast on the revenue front and were going to keep the expenses where they were forecasted originally so give us some more time as we work through this year but to your point based on this basis point decline this quarter in margin it would delay that sort of quarteroverquarter increase in fourth quarter and to your point maybe into but well continue to update this forecast as we get to the conclusion of the riskweighted asset optimization program catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful it makes sense and then as we think about indiscernible higherforlonger environment youve given great disclosure and discussion jamie about the difference in the margin once we start to see rate cuts that to basis points that you talk about how do you think about what growth how growth changes when we start to get cut your guide is to without cuts but is it fair to say that when we start to get cuts that growth could actually start to accelerate and then if were kind of higherforlonger will we stay at the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 lowend of that growth range just kind of curious about the dynamics between growth and margin in the rate environment thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we do believe that easing would be stimulative to growth on the loan book we also believe i mean when you look at our client profile a marginal rate cut or a marginal rate hike does not have it does not have a tremendous impact on the credit outlook of our clients like when we look at the credit impact of easing and tightening we think that our kind of our fdm disclosures are a good indication of the rate impact there and only of those have any sort of rate component to the modification and so we dont think theres a big credit impact but theres also in an easing environment there are positives to fee revenue and so we believe that it will be a net positive to your point on the loan side to loan production but also to capital markets fees to mortgage fees core banking fees and so there are when you look across the income statement we think it will be positive to loan growth we think it could ease deposit mix pressures and we think it will be positive to fee revenue catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that makes sense so ph with fee i think we focus so much on just the margin right in the higher forlonger versus the environment ph when we see rate cut but it feels like theres enough with all that you lay out and thats really why youre kind of thinking about only a less than change in nii if we start to get cuts in the backhalf of the year along the forward curve andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah makes sense all right great very helpful thank you operator thank you the next question is from the line of gary tenner with da davidson gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning a couple of questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 on credit just that good morning just that large ci credit that you called out a few times could you be any more specific in terms of kind of industry and maybe the issues surrounding that particular credit was it a longer term struggling company or maybe just some color on that robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey gary its bob thanks for the question its an aviation credit south florida sort of bankruptcy working through we were a co senior lender with another lender involved in subordinated debt behind us worked through the bankruptcy as a going concern sale that option didnt materialize as well as we thought it would we increased reserves on the credit we actually had to credit fairly well reserved and when we took the chargeoff it was pretty much equal to the reserve amount so we think we managed it the right way it was from our perspective it had good equity in it but for a number of specific factors that i really wont get into in the bankruptcy but nonetheless the best option was to get it refinanced and sold through an asset sale thats exactly what happened and we ended up taking the charge and getting it resolved so does that help gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co yeah it does appreciate that and then just in terms of the expectation jamie for a flat nim in the second quarter given the commentary about the trends in the first quarter i think the cost of deposits in march was essentially flat to the quarter and you flagged pricing on now accounts and money markets has been pretty flat so other than some additional mix potentially and a small amount of upward push on cd based on the kind of repricing of those it feels like the flattening even is a little bit conservative am i missing something as im interpreting your comments on the nim andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp your comments on the deposit side and the funding calls are spot on and thats what we see as we see a little bit of pressure due to nib declines ongoing now we havent seen anything in april that would turn us from that impact april has been constructive todate we would expect to see a little bit of pressure on time deposits but as i mentioned the maturities are at a similar rate as our new and renewed production rate so thats where we are on the deposit side and we do expect to see stability as i said on the nonmaturity interestbearing deposits and then when you look at the first quarter margin it was also impacted by loan fees being lower than typical its impacted by interest reversals and we think that those are more of a first quarter event and will not be continued and so there are tailwinds there to the margin but for now our guidance is for flat in the second quarter but those are the individual components as we see them gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of jared shaw with barclays synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning everybody andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc maybe just following up on the question steve was asking about the market when you strip out some of the noise from portfolios that youre exiting would you say youre being successful in attracting newtothebank customers right now or is most of that core growth coming from existing customers and can you comment i guess a little bit on the competitive market with maybe some of the bigger peers are they still losing customers overall or do you feel like theyre maybe doing a little better job or recently retaining those commercial customers kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah absolutely not only winning customers we start with winning talent and so you look at those areas that we highlight as strategic growth initiatives middle market over the last three years weve increased our bankers by roughly and those bankers are continuing to win new business business from the institutions theyve come from as well as just prospecting efforts and so the growth in middle market both on the loan and deposit side is coming from that new talent and from new clients on the cib front we have ftes were up to right around million in loan outstandings another million of growth this quarter six new clients we have onboarded this year and so thats coming from brandnew relationships and expanding existing relationships our specialty lending area both for our lender finance as well as our restaurant services again new clients expanding the existing relationships so in every situation not only are we winning talent we are winning the competitive war of taking clients from other folks so thats the game as i said earlier we have a great marketplace but if you think rising tides raise all boats then youre missing an opportunity we want to get more than our fair share of growth and were doing that in those areas offsetting that are areas that were running down credit and that doesnt mean that were losing clients in many situations were just deemphasizing growth in those areas and letting certain loans to payoff and paydown so we are super excited the competitive landscape with the big banks to your point theres always opportunities anytime theres a merger there continues to be some personnel changes that occur which allow us to go out and get more talent in these marketplaces weve been adding it in all of our metro markets and really across all of our footprint and look you go back to the fdic data last year to talk about this we grew market share in the state of georgia by basis points in the msa of atlanta basis points and so for me thats the real message is weve got to get talent weve got to grow at a pace that meets our shareholders expectations but most importantly weve got to take share from our competitors synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats great color thanks and then maybe shifting just a little bit im looking at slides and and looking at the maturity schedules of office and multifamily over the next two years whats the expectation with those maturities is your appetite to try to retain those if possible or whats the i guess health of those loans being able to be taken out somewhere else away from the bank robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey jared its bob just to start on that and jamie can touch on it as well but certainly our first and foremost priority is to work with our clients again to kevins point if it is a relationship client somebody that were doing business with and the loan matures and were going to work to retain that client and thats our first priority now if its a nonrelationship transactional piece of business and we dont have much of that but we do have some and as kevin mentioned in his comments around remixing the balance sheet a little bit we may choose to exit or get that refinanced but it really comes down to client selection we think weve got good clients that can move through these maturities weve certainly done a lot of analysis on what does the rate environment look like and what the capital markets look like relative to maturities stress testing cap rates et cetera so we feel okay about our ability to move through our maturity schedule without what i would consider to be significant credit events now though there will always be some stress there but we feel good about it particularly as it relates to multifamily office maybe to your point would be a little more stressed relative to valuations because thats kind of where we are in the cycle but from our perspective we have a little over of our office book is currently rated and that book has been analyzed enormously and were sitting at around and thats relatively stable to last quarter and six loans in there make up a majority of that number so assuming that we can kind of work through those six and we dont backfill we can kind of get through the office maturity wall as well so were feeling pretty confident about our ability to manage through it kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and bob the only thing id add to that is that when you think about each asset class theyre a little different but almost of our multifamily is in construction so when those are completed theyll go on to permanent financing were not generally a longterm permanent financier for those and so therell be a kind of a natural churn and what weve seen the last two quarters is a fairly healthy level of payoff and paydown activities both from sales as well as just refinancing through some of the agencies and so i think the important part is to bobs point were going to keep the clients we want to keep and those asset classes that we want to continue to lend into those that will go into more permanent financing the markets are opening up and its going to be a much more constructive environment and then well be able to backfill those with new construction projects and new cre developments behind that jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks a lot operator thank you the next question is from the line of michael rose with raymond james synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions jamie i was just hopeful that on slide you can give us some color around your beta assumptions on the way down and maybe how you arrived at some of those thatd be helpful thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah michael as we think about betas this is actually pretty similar to what we discussed a few months ago is when you look at our portfolio and this is why we included that slide to really give some clarity at a high level of how do we think about repricing deposits in an easing environment and so you have obviously you have a portion of the portfolio thats noninterest bearing then you have a portion of the portfolio thats really high beta and its a little more systematic and those are time and brokered and we do expect to see those brokered deposits will reprice at a very high beta same with time time would just be dependent on the maturities but then you get into the half of the portfolio half the deposit book that is either standard and low beta or high beta and so the standard and lower beta is around of the portfolio those are easier to reprice because theyre largely standard rates but their rates didnt go up as much in a tightening cycle so we dont expect them to go down as much in the easing cycle thats why we have the lower beta there and then on the exceptions and higher beta of the deposit book those we do expect to see decline at a higher beta you can see our assumptions on the slide but those will take those take conversations in some part that will likely be a little bit slower to reprice now we have plans for all of this so the timing is really up to us it depends on the environment it depends on the competitive landscape there are a lot of different factors that will go into it but thats how we have it set up were ready to go even though it looks like the timing of it continues to get delayed michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful and then maybe just as a followup from a kind of a regulatory aspect i think theres some fear that some of the bigger bank rules after what happened with nycb could get pushed down to banks sub100 billion can you just kind of talk about kind of what the cet1 ratio kind of looks like when including kind of the aoci impacts no matter what some of the larger banks are kind of contemplating at this point thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah on the capital when we look at that our cet1 inclusive of aoci is and we feel fine about that as we look at our capital ratios including aoci we think that theyre manageable we think the aoci accretion will happen over time we believe about of the aoci will accrete back in over by the end of next year so thats where we currently stand and on capital ratios we mentioned this riskweighted asset work that is expected to improve capital ratios but its interesting we havent determined exactly what we would do when we get to the finish line on this but its an interesting question when you take into context the cet1 inclusive of aoci like the cat iv banks because securities repositioning would not necessarily impact that because its already in your capital ratios synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 and so thats one of the considerations we think about when we get to the finish line what does it look like where are we within our target or above our target range and what do we do about it that is one of the considerations michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks michael operator thank you the next question is from the line of stephen scouten from piper sandler stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone thanks for the time i guess i was curious kevin you mentioned deposits probably were pressured a little bit more than you had expected can you talk about was that certain segments certain geographies rural versus maybe wholesale or like kind of what the moving parts of that incremental pressure was or is it more about that mix away from noninterestbearing still thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well its both i mean the mix away from noninterestbearing is the first thing but then when you look at the primary reason that were seeing increased expenses or increased rates its on the cd front and so part of it has been just as more balances move into cds the actual remixing the impact that that rate on that portfolio has on the overall portfolio is the bigger issue as jamie mentioned when we look at the individual categories like money market and now those rates have actually peaked and in some cases ticked down a basis point or two so it has really more to do with just the remixing into cds and those rates as the question earlier have stayed very high in the competitive landscape so weve had to keep our rates higher as well we have tried to shorten the duration there our oddterms rate is five months so were going to have the opportunity if rates were to decline to reprice those deposits much more quickly than if they were months but its really more due to the remixing thats happening there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and stephen let me give you one more data point as you look kind of one layer deeper a lot of the deposit outflows that we saw in the first quarter were with our larger clients but when you look within the community bank which you can think about those as being our core clients we saw growth significant growth in transactional deposits and so on now accounts in the community bank they were up quarteronquarter if you look at money market accounts they were up quarteronquarter so thats strong growth with our core clients and those are the type of trends that we want to lean into and help fee as we go through stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 yeah thats an important distinction appreciate that and then just one clarifying question on the you talked about like a million move in the reserve from a qualitative basis is that kind of encapsulating what you show on slide with the change in your weightings towards the various economic scenario andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp no thats separate that would be in the portfolio component of that and thats separate than the economic outlook stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect very helpful thanks guys appreciate the time kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you steve operator thank you the next question is from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning this is brian wilczynski filling in for manan i was wondering if you could talk about going back to credit the breakdown of your nonperforming loan balances with ci aside from that one credit that you charged off this quarter i asked because a few of your peers have cited weaker ci this quarter and im wondering if there are any broad themes youre seeing from an industry perspective robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey brian its bob i would say no broad themes certainly if you look at our nonaccrual ratio and ill set the one credit aside just for this discussion so would drop us down to around million giveortake of non accruals about of that is ci so but no specific industries in there most of those ci credits have either specific reserves on them or weve already marked those credits to where we think is appropriate and the exit is in process so yes the nonaccrual portfolio would be more heavily weighted to ci today but from our perspective its a manageable number of credits we have credits above million and we can put a pretty good pencil on a number of those as it relates to resolution plan so when you start ph wheeling it down it is ci heavy but we think we got a very quantifiable number and more importantly what we see in terms of new inflows is very light so we think the ci piece is going to be continue to be a little more idiosyncratic theres going to be some but thats the way we think about the corporate space and then when you look at sort the other components of our overall rated portfolio weve got a senior housing component in there because its been through the pandemic and the labor cost increases its beginning to stabilize so that would be more of a positive synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 and then finally it would be cre would be the third piece and thats specifically related to office and as i mentioned earlier i think were around of our office portfolio is rated and when we drill into those numbers as kevin mentioned the deep dives there that weve done on office and multifamily dont give us any significant concern about just a backlog of new potential problems so as we work through those office loans that will take time and that framework of those kind of categories is whats kind of guarding our chargeoff guide as kevin mentioned earlier that we think we can begin to see improved chargeoff numbers toward the back of the year certainly into assuming that we kind of remain in a rate environment an economic environment that were in and that we dont see really any surprises but our analysis doesnt reveal that today brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate the color thank you and then just as a followup i was wondering if you could unpack your rate sensitivity to the longend of the curve do you get a material benefit from the increase in the 10year yield that we have seen over the past few weeks and if so how do you see that playing out through the end of thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we continue to be assetsensitive to the longend of the curve so the increase in rates is beneficial to us its similar conversations that weve had before where when you rollforward from the december conference to the january earnings announcement we spoke to a 5basispoint difference in the margin expectation in the fourth quarter due to the change in rates thats a good indication of that asset sensitivity to the longend of the curve and its approximately brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and is that primarily from i would imagine thats primarily from fixed rate loan repricing do you have any color on how much is coming due over the next three quarters andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so on the securities portfolio we have about million a month in paydowns and so thats just steady flow steady repricing you see our book yield on the securities portfolio thats part of that accretion and then we have about a billion mortgage portfolio that that is paying down at about a year brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you brian operator thank you we have the next question from the line of timur braziler from wells fargo synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe can we get an update on what you expect the cadence of brokered deposits declines to look like throughout the course of the year and then as we look at broader time deposit growth just your appetite there it seems like theres some ability for the balance sheet maybe to use some balance sheet liquidity and maybe not grow time deposits as fast as theyve been growing maybe just give us your thoughts about just the loanto deposit or the cadence of brokered deposit paydowns and then your appetite for time deposits andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah timur great questions on brokered we do expect to see those continue to decline as we go through the year its safe to use million to million per quarter for that on time deposits youre exactly right first if you look at wholesale funding were down over in wholesale funding yearoveryear and so that gives a lot of flexibility on the liquidity side to choose the most economical way to fund the bank now with regards to time deposit part of that is client demand and so we have to react to where clients are on what theyre looking for on their deposits and theres a lot of attraction to time deposits and so we need to be there for them with a competitive rate but youre right the pressure to get incremental liquidity is simply not there given all the avenues we have for liquidity and we could slow down the decline in brokered we could use online bank or we can grow the time deposits we do expect core deposits to be relatively stable in the firsthalf of the year and then we expect to see growth in the secondhalf of the year and so we will continue to analyze and be balanced on the profitability and the client demand piece of that but thats how were looking at it timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then within the loan book just in the ci portfolio indiscernible of ci loans that are the finance and insurance companies can you give us an update as to what that entails and then more specifically what component of those loans are to borrowers that are using that as leverage to make other commercial loans kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp look the portfolios our lender finance business and as jamie talked about earlier maybe to give you some comfort around the asset quality those are the portfolios were looking at to get the reduced riskweighted asset treatment so as jamie mentioned risk weighting down to potentially a riskweighted treatment which means that theres good sponsorship theres good coverage on the assets and to your point these are not levered assets these are assetbased structures that provide repayment within the ability to liquidate those assets synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 so its not a levered portfolio per se its wellstructured its assetbased and ultimately may qualify for a actual lower riskweighted asset treatment timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator thank you we have the next question from the line of russell gunther with stephens russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc just wanted to good morning just a couple of quick followups the first on growth just wanted to get a sense for what inning youd say we were in in terms of the strategic decline in nonrelationship loans i understand this is included in the guide but it would be helpful to get a sense of the magnitude of the impact and timelines for that headwind to abate and kind of get back to that growth to your outlook that you were discussing earlier kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp look when you look at the quarter we had about million of declines in the snc portfolio another million in thirdparty those will continue for the foreseeable future number one remember that both of these were surrogates for the securities portfolio when we had excess liquidity and so in this environment unless we are seeing better economic we would expect that sort of run rate to continue so expect somewhere around million to million of runoff each quarter so that would not change now the good news is that could be more than offset as we get to some of these marketrelated declines so once senior housing gets to kind of their final portfolio size and the real estate portfolio builds back their pipeline to offset some of the paydown activities i think that those marketrelated declines will more than offset the growth there we will more than offset these strategic declines which would put more of the growth back towards that mid singledigit level russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thats great okay i appreciate that there and then just switching gears onto the fee guide could you guys just remind us the outlook for greensky to contribute this year and then the capital markets expectation as well just confidence in that yearoveryear growth rate and drivers there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 we if you look at the first quarter on greensky it played out as expected we had a strong quarter a little less than million of revenue associated with that and going forward the reason for the revenue will change so if you think about it that deal closed in the first quarter so we had a passthrough of the loan book but going forward its the flow arrangement and in the flow arrangement we actually expect revenues to be in a similar area slightly below the first quarter but in a similar area per quarter as we go through with regards to capital markets we feel really good about we think its going to be a strong year for capital markets coming off of the first quarter and increasing as we go through the year and the components of capital markets we have client swaps which are relatively low at the moment but we expect to see growth in lead arranger fees the agency fees and we expect to see those as we go through and we think that can be one of the good drivers when we said overall nir growth in the low to mid singledigits and a lot of that is capital markets we think that the strength there will continue as we go through this year kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and to your point to jamies conviction those are in our pipeline today and our pipeline in cib and wholesale are the largest they have been in some time and so its not just forecasting we actually see the transactions that well be able to execute on russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc i appreciate it guys thank you both operator thank you we have next question from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks just a quick question for bob as it pertains to the office maturities are any of those tied back to medical office is that blended in with the number robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp chris its blended as the total office book and then christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay indiscernible robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp excuse me yeah the medical component is about million giveortake of our total office book christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc so we can proportionately adjust the maturities by that that was all i was saying on that so synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp no im sorry chris theres about million of medical office loans in our current office portfolio that does not include the asset sale we did on the institutional medical office building so we still have about million of mainly speaking community banking medical offices that are in our office portfolio today christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and bob are you seeing any further stress on debt service coverage ratios as it pertains to office or has that largely been reflected in the criticized component robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp its largely been reflected chris i mean we certainly its still migrating and theres certainly still a slight negative bias to office obviously youve got valuation changes and we certainly feel good about the markets were in but some of them are more stressed than others but from a debt service coverage perspective it would be reflected in our current rate status of around basis rather on the rated book so obviously lease expirations and lease rollovers and those types of things are what were doing every day and analyzing those looking out to our maturities and when these leases roll over or the sublease activities et cetera so a lot of variables in our office analysis which is kind of built into our sort of normal portfolio management businessasusual activities today and its reflected in our current risk ratings and we feel good about the accuracy of those right now christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for all the disclosure on this we appreciate it robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp thanks chris operator thank you the next question is from the line of brandon king with truist securities brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey a twopart question on the net interest margin expansion the to basis points in secondhalf of this year how much of that are you expecting to occur in fourth quarter versus third quarter and then second part of the question is looking beyond that is that a certain pace that we can expect going forward or it could even be more just looking at your fixed rate loan repricing schedule ph just looking to andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2024 yeah brandon thats a great question we do expect to see that expansion largely in the secondhalf of the year and late in the year is an important time for that expansion and largely due to some hedge maturities in the fourth quarter we have million of hedge maturities in the fourth quarter at pretty low rates and those will be impactful to both the fourth quarter and then incrementally again to the first quarter in i think when you think longer term about our margin what i would say is first think about the headwinds on the liability side we clearly saw those in the first quarter we expect those to be mitigated in the second quarter as we see stabilization in both rate and mix and so then you look at the margin and you think about the benefit of the fixed rate asset repricing and so that really becomes powerful and its a multiyear benefit and so weve talked about that in the past but that benefit will flow through assuming rates stay relatively stable and well continue to see that benefit and so when i look longerterm and i look at the fourth quarter of this year and i compare it to the fourth quarter of there is about a 20basispoint benefit due to fixed rate asset repricing and there are a lot of variables that can impact that outside of those fixed rate repricing benefits but thats a pretty important tailwind to the margin and so yes we expect the margin expansion to continue as we get into next year but just due to the fixed asset repricing but i just wanted to be really clear on that one brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay very helpful and lastly on the rwa optimization once thats complete how are you thinking about basically deploying that capital generated into securities repositioning versus potentially buying back more shares andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thats a great question and its something that were currently working through and well make the decisions on that once the analysis and documentation is complete because its a pretty hefty lift to get to where we want to be and make sure that weve done everything right but the way we are thinking about that is looking at our capital ratios and we also look at our capital ratios inclusive of aoci because we think that cat iv banks in the way that regulators are looking at it we think that that matters as well and so we want to be balanced in how we deploy it but assuming things play out we likely expect we would expect to deploy a large portion of it to securities repositioning deploy some of it to share repurchases but really just try to stay at the highend of our target range of cet1 to and so more to come on that you can be sure that as soon as we have everything locked down which we expect in the near term we will let everybody know brandon king q analyst truist securities inc

being in attendance today and your continued interest in synovus id also like to thank and recognize all of our team members who are listening in today our financial results as we presented them this morning are a direct result of what you do daily to serve our clients and to differentiate us from our competitors our first quarter results reflect a contraction in the margin and we believe that this will reverse into expansion for the year to come our fee income expectations have risen our expenses are being wellmanaged on the credit front as weve shared today lots of metrics but the summary is the outlook for chargeoffs is stable to lower even as we build our allowance higher and from an overall business activity standpoint were seeing some green shoots our loan pipelines are starting to increase a bit and sales activities across our client segments are picking up as weve shared in recent quarters our strategic focus is on leveraging our trusted and valued approach to serving and advising our clients to deepen relationships and to deliver prudent and profitable growth as we navigate an uncertain economic and interest rate environment we are equally focused on strengthening our returns as well as our balance sheet which in turn translates into a more riskresilient profile i truly believe that we have progress throughout the remainder of this year and even into and we will continue to build upon our momentum and return the bank to a more diversified and consistent growth orientation for our investors we look forward to seeing many of you in the upcoming conferences in
