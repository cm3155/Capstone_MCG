thank you sean good morning we appreciate everyone joining us this morning ill begin on slide number financial and operational results remain strong and demonstrate unique scale and positioning of our businesses broadly speaking macro uncertainty and market volatility are elevated the challenges of persistent inflation rapidly rising interest rates quantitative tightening and geopolitical conflict are very real the combination of these events occurring simultaneously presents unique challenges that are likely to continue in the quarters ahead however i remain optimistic in allys outlook given the strength of our businesses and the power of our people and culture staying true to our culture has enabled us to successfully grow through various economic environments in the past and that will continue as we navigate the environment ahead our focus and actions for all stakeholders will remain rooted in our do it right philosophy in june we pledged to reach equal media spend across mens and womens sports beyond the financial impact supporting equality is the right thing to do and we hope our pledge inspires others as well were well underway with our recognition of supplier diversity month in july this initiative is integral to our broader goals for financial and social inclusion and while we arent done weve seen a significant increase in diverse spend since the programs inception ally will remain nimble and ready to pivot quickly to the evolving landscape we remain intensely focused on controlling what we can control and have further heightened our emphasis on prudent investment discipline and expense management given the range of possible economic outcomes jenn and i are deeply engaged with our business leaders on ensuring only the most essential projects and hires are prioritized our industry leading auto and insurance businesses have deep relationships with thousands of dealer customers over allys history we have proven to be a reliable and adaptable partner driving growth and value creation again through various economic cycles across ally bank we continue to see solid customer momentum and engagement across the array of complementary businesses so while different operating and economic environments will be encountered we remain true to our longterm strategy of serving customers and staying nimble as operators lets turn to slide number where ill touch on a few highlights from second quarter adjusted eps of core rotce of and revenues of billion reflected another strong quarter of financial results rotce was approximately excluding the impact of oci the scale and depth of dealer relationships coupled with healthy consumer demand drove strong originations in the quarter that requires a meaningful initial provision expense under cecl that positions us well to drive accretive risk adjusted returns going forward recent ccar results conveyed the strength and resilience of our company overall our preliminary scb of was down basis points from the exam capital and liquidity levels also remain healthy within auto consumer originations of billion represented our highest quarterly flows since and originated yields expanded basis points quarteroverquarter to industry vehicle sales were down and yearoveryear across new and used respectively despite that headwind our ability to generate strong consumer originations shows the scale of our auto business and depth of application flow credit normalization in the second quarter continued in line with expectations and retail ncos of basis points remained well below prepandemic levels we are monitoring for market indicators of consumer health including wage and price inflation employment conditions deposit balance changes and overall debt payment trends from an auto industry production perspective the story remains consistent supply chain challenges continue and demand remains robust resulting in low levels of inventory and therefore support for used vehicle values dealer health also remains very strong jenn will discuss used vehicle dynamics in more detail in a moment and i think it is very important for you to understand whats actually happening in the industry frankly im not sure the constant focus on used car price implications on allys earnings is warranted with an insurance written premiums ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 of million reflected lower overall inventory levels and industry sales investment portfolio performance remained solid but below last years record levels turning to ally bank retail deposit customers exceeded million expanding yearoveryear and representing our 53rd consecutive quarter of customer growth as weve indicated in recent months retail balances were pressured by elevated tax payments observed across the industry while retail balances declined nearly billion in the quarter they were up yearoveryear and total deposits of billion account for roughly of our funding profile our compelling consumer engagement and product adoption trends remain compelling ally home originated million in the quarter reflecting a disciplined approach to navigating a rising interest rate environment i also think its important to note that our partnership model isolated us from some of the substantial operating volatility others have reported equity markets resulted in a decline in ally invest assets while accounts actually increased versus prior year ally lending generated record origination volume of million which nearly doubled yearoveryear as we continued our expansion of merchant relationships and volume in the healthcare and home improvement verticals ally credit card reached billion of loan balances up more than yearoveryear and now has over active cardholders up from prior year and corporate finance generated another solid quarter of loan growth with the held for investment portfolio reaching billion deep partner relationships and expansion into new verticals has enabled steady disciplined growth in that business lets turn to slide number where ill touch on the value proposition weve established ally has a unique combination of established leading and scale businesses coupled with newer and growing businesses specifically more than million customers span our leading auto and deposit businesses and more recently we benefited from accelerating growth from card lending and invest areas we saw as white spaces for our company in ally bank our position as the number one alldigital bank is fueled by more than million deposit customers which have grown at a nearly annual rate since its founding in weve been relentlessly focused on digital disruption and leveraging shifts in consumer preferences including nearly digital interactions within deposits and invest within auto our 100plusyear history has positioned ally as the number one prime auto lender as weve simultaneously grown dealer relationships to over up more than in the past few years the scale of our operations enables our full spectrum adaptable approach to consumer and commercial auto lending that has proven resilient as operating and economic conditions change our alldigital auto auction platform provides an attractive disposition channel and realtime data into used vehicle trends nationwide our auto collections team has also enhanced its digital engagement with consumers from here were focused on strengthening all of our customer relationships as higher engagement has significant benefits with a few examples just mentioned and also highlighted on the page looking ahead we know our customercentric modern digitalfirst approach will position us to drive further customer growth strong engagement and value in the years ahead i think the important takeaway is that while covid might have accelerated the benefits of our business model we dont believe a great unwind will happen now as the pandemic is slowing our model was built because we believe it is how consumers want to bank today and in the future we also think car ownership was again proven to be a mainstay in consumers lives yes we will have fluctuations in various quarters just like everyone but long term the company remains poised for substantial value creation last quarter one of our key stakeholders perhaps said it best ally is one of the great corporate transformation stories of our lifetimes ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 obviously i could not agree anymore and suggested a longerterm focus on our evolution and sustainable earnings power is a much better indicator of our focus and success so we will keep our head down we will keep taking care of customers we will be smart and dynamic operators and we will be disciplined stewards of capital deployment i still firmly believe that is what drives longterm value creation and that is our focus and with that jenn over to you jennifer a laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb and good morning everyone ill begin on slide with a few consumer health indicators we are watching closely starting with our deposit accounts the average savings balance remains well above pre pandemic levels across all income bands while balances have started to normalize they remain robust despite elevated tax outflows strong spending and persistent inflation in retail auto we generated a increase in application flow while industry sales fell weve continued to see strong demand particularly in the higherincome segment where we originate the majority of our loans on the bottom left delinquency levels remain generally favorable especially in the highervolume higherincome deciles and lastly both frequency and severity metrics remains below levels driven by healthy payment trends and elevated collateral values while we expect further credit normalization we are starting from a strong position and have prudent underwriting and servicing strategies to navigate a variety of macroeconomic environment lets turn to slide where weve included a snapshot of key measures demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet our liquidity capital and reserves remain robust and above prepandemic levels cet1 ended the quarter at reflecting nearly billion of excess capital relative to our internal operating target of and based on recent ccar results our stress capital buffer has declined basis points to resulting in nearly billion of excess capital relative to scb requirements our deposit portfolio represents of funding relative to in and we maintain access to multiple efficient funding sources enhanced by our investment grade rating allowance for loan losses of or billion represents over times our reserve level in and approximately million higher than cecl day detailed results for the quarter are on slide net financing revenue excluding oid of billion grew nearly million or yearoveryear despite a decline in lease revenue this represents the eighth consecutive quarter of expanding net financing revenue performance in the quarter was driven by continued strength in origination volumes and auto pricing growth in unsecured consumer products normalization of excess liquidity and hedging activity partially mitigating impacts from short term rate increases adjusted other revenue of million reflected solid performance across our insurance smartauction and consumer banking businesses revenues declined yearoveryear as we generated significant investment gains in the prior period provision expense of million reflected robust origination volume and the gradual normalization of credit performance loan growth across retail auto unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance drove million reserve build while cecl provisioning is a headwind for the current period strong originations will drive accretive longterm risk returns net chargeoffs in the period of million remained below prepandemic levels but are up versus prior year which included a net recovery in the period noninterest expense of billion includes the seasonal increases in insurance weather losses and continued investment in technology and business growth as a reminder the prior period included onetime items related to the ally foundation sic ally ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 charitable foundation and retirement eligibility benefits gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively including a impact from the provision build moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of expanded basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear total earning assets have been relatively flat as excess cash normalizes but total loans and leases are up nearly billion versus prior year overall margin expansion reflects the structurally enhanced balance sheet we have built over several years earning asset yield of grew basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting the same nii drivers i just mentioned retail auto portfolio yield expanded basis points from the prior quarter as originated yields moved materially higher we are pleased weve been able to capture significantly higher rates while growing origination volume as rates have increased our payfixed hedges against the retail auto portfolio have delivered a meaningful linked quarter benefit on an absolute basis hedges were a slight drag on yields for the full quarter but have moved into a positive carry position and will help drive portfolio yields above in the third quarter yield also expanded across commercial portfolios and credit card as they benefit from higher rates looking forward we expect earning asset yield expansion driven by our leading market position in auto finance continued growth across our newer consumer portfolios and the impact of higher interest rates turning to liabilities cost of funds increased basis points quarteroverquarter but declined basis points yearoveryear the increase in average deposit cost reflects higher benchmark rates and a competitive market for deposits particularly in the direct bank space other borrowings increased billion on average this quarter driven by fhlb advances and efficient funding alternative broadly speaking funding costs will move higher as the fed continues with the tightening cycle but we remain confident in our ability to manage interest expense due to our customer value proposition that goes beyond rate core funding status and access to diverse funding sources the growth and strength of our businesses on both sides of the balance sheet allowed us to achieve a 4plus percent nim this quarter for the next few quarters the rapid increase in benchmark rates will pressure margins as deposits initially repriced faster than earning assets over the medium term we continue to see a strong nim in the upper turning to slide our cet1 ratio declined to as earnings supported billion in rwa growth and million in share repurchases last week we announced a dividend of per share and has completed approximately billion in repurchases through june we remain on track to complete our billion buyback program for and will remain flexible and disciplined considering potential changes in the macroeconomic environment on the bottom of the slide shares outstanding have declined since we resumed share repurchases in and since the inception of our buyback program in our priorities remain focused on maintaining prudent capital levels while investing in the growth of our businesses and returning capital to shareholders lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points remain below prepandemic levels and are normalizing in line with expectations the chargeoffs of a specific credit in the corporate finance portfolio added basis points to the consolidated nco rates for the quarter as a reminder ncos in this portfolio can be uneven but the business has averaged annualized losses below basis points over a sustained period in addition our new unsecured consumer products will drive higher consolidated losses and higher risk adjusted returns as they grow retail auto portfolio performance continues to reflect resilient consumer payment trends and favorable loss given default rates supported by elevated vehicle collateral values in the bottom right 30day delinquencies increased due to typical seasonality and a gradual normalization of consumer trends but remained below 60day delinquencies are equal to however they are elevated due to the impact of strategic repossession timing changes that have improved further loss rates we expect ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 gradual increase in delinquencies as consumer trends normalize postpandemic and we are closely monitoring additional inflationary pressures we have continued to invest in talent and technology to enhance our servicing and collection capabilities and remain confident in our ability to effectively manage credit in a variety of environments on slide consolidated coverage increased basis points to reflecting growth in our retail auto unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance portfolios the total reserve increased to billion or million higher than cecl day levels retail auto coverage of increased basis points and remains basis points higher than cecl day under our cecl methodology our baseline forecast assumes stable unemployment ending the year slightly below before gradually reverting to a historical mean of about on slide total deposits of billion declined billion as increases in brokered cds partially offset a decline in retail deposits retail balances decreased billion quarteroverquarter driven by elevated tax outflows as weve mentioned previously our portfolio includes significant balances from affluent depositors generally more susceptible to tax liability outflows consistent with prior cycles we expect flows from traditional banks to direct banks will increase as the price gap widens especially with savings rates now exceeding we saw retail deposit growth in june and continue to expect growth on a full year basis we added another customers in q2 our 53rd consecutive quarter of customer growth loyalty and engagement across our million customers are reflected in industry leading and consistent retention of and growth of multiproduct relationships turning to slide we continue to drive scale and diversification across our digital bank platforms deposits serve as a gateway to our other banking products which enhance brand loyalty drive engagement and deepen customer relationships we also see a clear path for expansion among our newer pointofsale lending and credit card products which are helping to offset more cyclical businesses like mortgage our focus on delivering integrated diversified and digitalfirst capabilities for our customers supports our outlook for continued growth and accretive returns in the years ahead lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was driven by growth in retail auto balances and yield and solid credit performance the increase in provision expense versus prior periods resulted from cecl reserve build to support over billion in consumer originations with attractive risk adjusted returns looking at the bottom left the originated yield of was up basis points from the prior quarter reflecting significant pricing actions we have put more than basis points of price into the market through last week and expect to originate at over for the quarter while maintaining consistent underwriting standards reflective of strong dealer engagement while pricing data will move around from quartertoquarter and should be viewed through the tightening cycle we are pleased with the momentum todate and remain confident in our ability to generate higher yields from here we continue to see elevated retail trading activity and lessee buyouts which create temporary headwinds for retail portfolio yields and remarketing gains that will normalize over time ill talk about these dynamics in more detail on the next page on slide we have provided perspective on used vehicle values and the associated impact to current period earnings we are aware of and understand the heightened focus on used values given the increase over the past two years as weve outlined before there are offsetting impacts to ally that net over time as used vehicle values rise and fall in this environment elevated collateral values continue to drive a positive impact of loss severity which contributes to lower net chargeoffs from a lease perspective option proceeds remain elevated with more than of lease terminations are purchased by the lessee or dealer which limits our ability to monetize the off lease gains ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 while collateral values have been a benefit to lease gains and credit losses the main driver of increased used vehicle values has been limited supply of new inventory lower inventory has reduced commercial assets by approximately billion and has increased retail trade and activity both of which are a headwind to net interest income we expect each of these factors to gradually reverse as supply chains improve and new vehicle production normalizes these dynamics will likely occur unevenly over the next several quarters and years but in aggregate should not result in a meaningful impact to earnings on a net basis turning to slide our leading agile platform is built to adapt to dealer and customer needs in a comprehensive manner reflected in our performance and the multiyear growth of our dealers we now have over active dealer relationships up more than over the past three years we continue to focus on deepening these relationships and increasing application flow in the upper right ending consumer assets expanded to billion up on a yearoveryear basis retail auto assets increased billion in the quarter and are up over billion from prior year based on current market conditions we see a clear path to over billion of consumer originations in commercial balances ended at billion as new vehicle supply remained near historic lows in the quarter turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page auto volume of billion represents our highest quarterly origination level since used accounted for of originations this quarter also reflecting a high watermark and a testament to our ability to adapt to market conditions our disciplined and consistent approach to underwriting and entrenched dealer relationships have driven increased originations while maintaining consistent fico and nonprime trends turning to insurance results on slide core pretax income of million decreased yearoveryear on the impact of lower industry vehicle sales dealer inventories and elevated investment gains versus prior year the increase in losses was primarily driven by weather claims which were at an alltime low in the prior period total written premiums of million reflected lower unit sales and inventory levels across the industry we remain focused on leveraging our significant dealer network and holistic offerings to drive future growth in the insurance business turning to corporate finance on slide core income of million reflected disciplined growth in the loan portfolio a yearoveryear decline in other revenue from elevated investment gains in the prior period and stable credit trends net financing revenue was impacted by interest rate floor on a portion of the loan portfolio which limited yield expansion following initial rate hikes given the current level of benchmark rates we expect yields to expand from here the loan portfolio remains diversified across industries with assetbased loans comprising of the portfolio our billion hfi portfolio is up yearoveryear reflecting our expertise and disciplined growth within a highly competitive market mortgage details are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of dtc originations reflecting tighter margins on conforming production and reduced demand from refinancing activity mortgage remains a key product for our customers who value a modern and seamless digital platform we are prioritizing a great experience for our bank customers an enhanced risk adjusted return which may lead to changing origination levels in any given quarter or year our partnership model ensures we avoid considerable operational volatility seen across the industry ill close by thanking our ally teammates who remain the driving force behind our strong operating and financial results and with that ill turn it back to jb ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks jenn finally ill close with a few comments on slide number i maintain a tremendous amount of pride leading our company over many years weve developed a purposedriven culture which is integral to our financial and operational performance ingrained within that culture is the unwavering focus on delivering for our teammates customers communities and stockholders this broad and deeply ingrained purpose will define our longterm success im sure youve seen various letters from ceos to shareholders write about the power of purpose in guiding your company and management teams that is a message we certainly embrace inside of ally and part of the reason i have the confidence that we will be able to deliver durable returns for our shareholders i continue to challenge our teammates to see around corners focus on essentialism adopting owners mindset and live our purpose to be an ally for all its embedded in our culture and has prepared us for changing times allys results this quarter demonstrate were equipped to successfully navigate and win in challenging environments with that sean lets head into qa sean leary headinvestor relations ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one follow up catherine please begin the qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks jenn you had talked a little bit about the pricing actions that youve taken so far can you talk a little bit about like how far that can go and at what point do you think the impact on the monthly payment will kind of limit the ability to take price so can you just talk about that a little thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thanks for the question moshe maybe some pricing comments on the asset side and then ill go over to the liability side but on the asset side moshe we have been really pleased with not only the flow weve been able to originate but the pricing actions weve taken which i mentioned is about basis points and through the second quarter were looking at kind of close to a beta relative to fed funds in retail auto pricing now going forward we got to be measured in terms of our ability to continue at that pace i think if you look at last cycle its more like a beta so somewhere in the middle there well be opportunistic we love the flows were seeing the returns were seeing and well continue to put price in but weve been at a beta probably will fluctuate a little bit as we move ahead especially as were anticipating another eight hikes in the forwards ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 and id also comment its not just retail auto we see a lot of opportunities to continue to see yield expansion we are growing our unsecured portfolios ally lending credit card we see really robust originated yields in the low teens for ally lending and the upper teens for credit card and were growing those very quickly you can see a path kind of at a billion to billion in those portfolios corporate finance continues to grow we hit a high watermark at billion and hfi this quarter continuing to see a clear path to about billion and yields expanded from there and then last but not least weve been really i think thoughtful around our investment securities portfolio managing duration in the book also putting hedges we have about billion notional against retail auto and that takes about a quarter of our retail auto portfolio and flips it to floating in a rising rate environment so yeah moshe on the asset side which is a very powerful driver of nii and nim we continue to see just robust growth robust ability to put pricing and yields on the books and ill just make note that we had a billion increase in loans on a yearoveryear basis its the highest loan growth weve ever seen with really great pricing momentum and then on the deposit side id say moshe things have materialized as expected i think were really pleased with the positioning were up deposits funded weve had about a pricing beta relative to fed funds we could see that accelerate a bit from here but weve got access to diverse and efficient funding sources we put on about billion of term funding at locked in some duration at great rates so we feel really good about both sides of balance sheet and moshe we really see that we can generate that upper nim as we head into the medium term moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much and just you talked a bit about credit normalization and the reserve and auto kind of being basis points above cecl day and up basis points in the second quarter how should we think about the pace of reserving and what should we or that level of the reserve relative to retail auto loans as we go through the rest of jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and let me just hit on what i think most parts at least are picking up across the media and the outlets this morning i mean look we had incredibly robust retail auto originations this quarter the highest levels that weve had since and the vast majority of the increase in our reserving this quarter is a result of loan growth and its accretive loan growth serving our customers positioning us well to drive accretive returns over time to generate that 16plus to 18plus percent rotce that we guide to and so we are kind of unapologetic about a reserve build this quarter and the vast majority of that again was retail auto growth as well as growth in some of our other newer products and moesha from there well see reserves bounce around a couple of basis point i mean as youre pointing out were up basis points on coverage rates a lot of thats just seasoning of the portfolio timing of when originations flow on and the portfolio flows off especially the post covid portfolio vintages but we see pretty likely stable from here could migrate down more towards that day seasonal level over time but were not in a hurry to do that especially considering some of the uncertainty on the horizon relative to macros moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you moshe operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess i have two questions one is as youre thinking about the medium term for nim i know you mentioned in the high could you just give us a sense as or in the upper i think is the words to used could you just give us a sense as to upper is that like plus or is that plus and i know its maybe you dont want to be that specific on the call but its just a bit of a debate out there what upper means to you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure i mean let me jump in on this betsy as we think about the longterm earnings power of the company look we delivered over this quarter could we see that coming down a bit to kind of plus in the medium term yeah and then in between now and the medium term it could bounce around a bit from here because you know our balance sheet we have liabilities that reprice faster than assets were going to see if we realize the forwards another hikes between now and december and so there could be some pressure on our margin just because deposits are going to reprice faster than assets but as i just mentioned in response to moshes call weve got terrific momentum on the assets side that will eventually catch up to the liability side its just a matter of timing as we go between now and kind of the tightening cycle but feel really confident medium term around that 37plus percent number with things moving around a bit here just relative to the forwards betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then could you just give us a little more color on the comments that you had around the delinquencies when you were on page i think you mentioned that you had taken some actions or recognized some parts of the portfolio differently maybe than you had in prior quarters so maybe you could give us a sense as to what drove that delinquencies up and if you could speak to what your expectation is as you look out over the next six to months how you see that trajecting either seasonally or structurally because the financial slide was removed the financial outlook slide was removed from this deck and theres been some questions on how youre thinking about the delinquencies in the ncos there thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 yeah sure so first on the delinquencies ncos were meant to the guide so on delinquencies look youre seeing some normalization flow through both the 30day and the 60day is all within our expectations i did mention in the 60day look were always investing in new strategies and new approaches to help our customers keep our customers in their car as longer so i made note of one of those around repossession timing which is essentially just giving our customers a little bit more time to pay weve had tremendous success with that approach and that just keeps that 60day number up temporarily as were rolling through this new policy but its normalization of the portfolio as expected there are some seasonality in there from a delinquency perspective and then some policy changes that are driving that growth what i would say relative to ncos is were still performing relative to the guide that we provided last quarter and quite frankly we didnt include the outlook slide because nothing really has changed betsy so under this year migrating slowly back up to that to by i mentioned the nim guide still intact and we still see a trajectory to that to 18pluspercent rotce and ill note this time its exoci so hopefully theres no confusion on that front which with continued really strong performance here in jb mentioned we printed rotce exoci well be kind of in that range for full year as well so i just want to be really clear we didnt put the financial outlook slide in simply because of longer term medium term guide every single quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you i appreciate the clarification there jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc absolutely thank you betsy for the questions operator thank you our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i wanted to go back to a question moshe asked about that the repricing of the loans and sort of when you might see more stress for the consumer to make those payments or demand erosion i mean if we go back in time can you just talk about when you hit up against these pricing levels and sort of what the impact might have been jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure sanjay so we have not traditionally seen increases in interest rates impact demand and i would say that this cycle is very similar to what weve seen in the past and if anything providing additional tailwind simply because supply has been constrained we continue to estimate million to million consumers on the sidelines simply because they cannot find a vehicle to purchase and you couple that demand with our model that has consistently grown dealer relationships dealer engagement and in a period where you see a reduction in sales units were generating a increase in application flow so strong demand a model that continues to win across prime and in particular prime used and we really dont see this slowing down i mean keep in mind a 100basis point increase in pricing for a car loan is to a month and according to some data this week thats kind of two loaves of bread these days so were not seeing a lot of price sensitivity just from the car interest rates and in particular id say in the more affluent segments and if you look at page ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 that i provided this morning we do see really strong application flow in the higher income earners which weve defined as kind of over and our average in terms of income of our customers that were originating with is over so in that segment with the supply constraints and with our model we really dont see this slowing down and we dont see a lot of price sensitivity for the interest rates nor do we even for the car which is materially higher these days sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc so hopefully that gives you some color sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no thats very helpful and then maybe just a followup question on the originations that was a really strong number im just curious how much of that is being driven by units versus share gains versus inflation maybe you could just touch on like ltvs and sort of the migration of ltvs as well thank you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure i mean look sanjay we are seeing really strong unit application flow but as weve come through covid definitely the price per unit is driving the strong flows and so ive guided towards kind of billion plus in terms of retail flow this year we would still see really strong originations as contract values potentially come down with used vehicle values you know weve modeled a reduction in used vehicle values but that simply will be replaced by a shift to more units so we dont see the overall number changing although we could see higher units driving net flows as we head into and beyond to be determined weve modeled used vehicle pricing coming down but i think theres a lot of dynamics around the supply chain that could suggest that it stays elevated for longer and then on ltv its been interesting we dont actually see an overall change in the ltv just as you look at the dynamics between new and used so not changing very materially at all i think on severity were monitoring that very closely weve modeled into our nco rate simply the fact that used vehicle values do come down about but again i think theres potentially some upside against that sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you very much good results jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you sanjay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc jb maybe a bigger picture question for you jenn highlighted numerous times the robust growth you saw i think jenn said best growth since markets are obviously flashing a bit of yellow lights right now and weve heard commentary from others regarding competitive forces in auto intensifying so just want to get a better sense for how youre thinking about growth at this point in the cycle and maybe any tweaks that youre making to underwriting at this point just given whats happened with the pricing of vehicles jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah correct ryan thanks for the question so we hear and we see the yellow lights flashing too and we do think the overall industry is tightening and competitive pressures are intensifying so we would definitely agree with those statements but i think it comes back to a little bit the power of the model that we built the relationships that weve established so i mean i dont think you can overstate the importance of growth in the dealer count which is now 22400ish dealers thats up over the past several years and then also just the relationships weve established with big players and new players like echopark carvana and others and while theres questions around their models were still seeing really strong flows from them in really high quality paper and so for us we have not at all changed underwriting standards i think our fico chart or fico analysis is pretty boring through time it really hasnt changed jenn just talked about ltv we really havent seen that change dti credit quality of the book remains really well intact obviously the question jenn and i when we sit down with our auto teams and our credit partners and our cro debate is around this outer look on severity if you get a meaningful decline in used car prices does that expose us again you dont see speculation in auto lending and we think to jenns point you priced in all that risk already in our assumptions around used car so for us its back to you take care of your customers you serve them very well and it provides nice rewards in terms of just seeing really strong flows id also look at other stats around what are we seeing are we seeing any changes in auto decisioning or not so right now credit underwriting remains disciplined i think the reason were winning is were just getting a bigger look we make it easy for dealers and so the flows are really strong obviously i appreciated sanjays comments a minute ago about how strong of a quarter it was and again whilst we may flash a miss on eps i think jenn and i would take that all day long because we put on really really accretive high quality loan growth that times going to contribute meaningfully to earnings and again back to looking at this paper for this quarter jenn talked about plus i remember ryan when we sat down at your conference in december and kind of one of the questions you posed to me was the rising rate outlook and we talked around auto loans being able to achieve an type of yield while youre seeing it now and so i think a lot of really positive dynamics and we would not want anyone to have a take away that weve altered credit appetite up or down to achieve this its just really strong relationships working well with your dealer partners so were really proud of the results this quarter ryan ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe just one final from me and i appreciate you remembering our conversation jenn maybe just the outlook for funding and balance sheet dynamics i think you said that you expect retail deposit growth for the rest of the year and i think you highlighted you saw growth in the month of june just how do you think about the level of growth in deposits from here and maybe just help us think about the notion of growing deposits versus lending securities shrink versus further tapping wholesale funding how do you think about using each of those as a lever to fund the balance sheet thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and youre spot on you were listening well ryan we are expecting full year retail deposit growth and weve been pleased so far with june results which have been solid and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks as you see that price gap widen between the direct banks and the traditional banks we tend to see outsized flows into the direct banks and in particular to ally so were confident in the growth from here i think in addition to that especially as were investment grade rated at this point we do have options to tap into alternative funding sources we did about billion of term funding this quarter locked in some duration around twoanda half years at incredibly low rate so were really pleased with some of the brokered cds weve put on the books fhlb we had some modest unsecured and secured issuances as well and well just continue to be opportunistic as we think about alternative funding sources but we feel really good about the liability stack the strength of our businesses the pricing that weve had to date has been very much in line with expectations and well just navigate the future the same way we have done in the past and us continuing to focus on strong value for our customers and continuing to be opportunistic or broad across a broad diversified set of funding alternatives ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you ryan operator thank you our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc hey guys thanks very much for taking my questions and good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning john ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc both you guys have referred to assuming lower used car prices i mean maybe can you detail like what kind of cadence youre expecting and what type of overall trends there and then just i guess the second follow on question is how does that affect the lease margin over the next several quarters jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure john let me just talk about what weve modeled and then what were seeing in reality and consistent with prior quarters we are modeling a pointtopoint reduction linearly in used vehicle values from the end of to so its a precipitous drop weve done that just to be mindful of the environment we know used vehicle values are elevated and we wanted to be just very prudent in how we modeled our medium term outlook so thats what weve modeled in there certainly as youd see used vehicle pricing come down youll see some pressure on gains some of that as ive mentioned several times could be slightly offset by lbo and dbo dynamics but all things considered you might see used vehicle value gains and yields come down a tad from there i mean of course theres also increases from rates there but there could be some modeled pressure on lease yields what were seeing in reality is very different yields and used vehicle pricing has remained robust heading into and as all of the dynamics that weve been talking around strong consumer strong demand continuing especially at the intersection of prime and used we dont see that slowing down from a demand perspective and supply continues to be challenged we continue to see oems inventory levels kind of bouncing around the bottom of 20day supply and theyve historically run 80day supply plus so favorable supply and demand dynamics could support used vehicle values to outperform our model so hopefully that gives you some color john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah i appreciate that very much thanks guys jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure operator our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous your line is open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys jenn i just wanted to zoom in on your deposit comments a little while ago a lot of the price action youve taken has come at the end of june and into july so just wondering if you could talk about how the receptivity has been to that so far for the first three weeks both on the balance side and the beta side ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah rob look were really pleased with flows that were seeing so far in june were mindful that were six hikes into a potential hike year here so i think as weve noted in the past well continue to lag rate as the fed fund rate increases and we dont need to be a leader across the industry but look were moving into a rapidly rising fed funds tightening cycle and so you could see some additional increases in pricing on the deposit side but as ive mentioned i think were really wellpositioned from a value proposition perspective with our customers as well as the fact that were deposit funded and we have access to alternative funding sources so were feeling good about our position were mindful of this kind of unprecedented increase in fed funds ahead of us but know that we can continue to navigate with confidence and continue to win and as i mentioned were really pleased with june flows and expecting full year deposit growth this year robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thanks and you also talked about putting on some more short term borrowings in the quarter can you just talk about how you expect that to factor into the funding mix going forward jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean were going to continue to do more of it opportunistically i mean you saw us add on that fhlb even in the fourth quarter continue to add on that fhlb in first and second quarters of weve had secured and unsecured issuances and i think youll see all of that going forward on an opportunistic basis and we look at everything in terms of pricing in terms of investor opportunities the market so we dont have any hard and fast numbers but were going to continue to leverage diverse funding sources as we move forward robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks a lot jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you rob operator thank you and thats all the time we have for questions id like to turn the call back to mr sean leary for closing remarks sean leary
