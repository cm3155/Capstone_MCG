fourth quarter since net earnings were billion resulting in earnings per share of and an roe of i would note that we took a billion litigation charge during the quarter which burdened eps and roe by and respectively overall our business performed well and against an improved market environment relative to the challenging backdrop experienced a year ago for the full year we generated firmwide net revenues of billion nearly matching last year which was our highest year in years we reported a return on equity of and a return on tangible equity of litigation impact to roe and rote was approximately basis points for the year we had a number of accomplishments in our incumbent businesses across the firm performed well and our new business initiatives progressed as planned as we navigated a dynamic operating environment over the course of the year on the revenue side our global markets business produced stronger results in an environment that improved over the year driven by strong leadership and a clear focus on client service we generated solid growth in ficc driven by strength across our franchise including rates commodities and mortgages we grew firmwide assets under supervision to record levels we also delivered strong equity investment performance which is an important precursor to our alternatives platform expansion plans the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 in investment banking our performance was solid in the context of lower industry deal volumes we held a commanding lead in our ma business and maintained our number one position in equity underwriting while our operating expenses grew as a function of litigation and investments in our businesses we actively controlled our costs across both compensation and noncompensation providing capacity to fund our growth from this position of strength we achieved important milestones in across our key growth opportunities we continue to institutionalize our one goldman sachs operating philosophy keeping clients at the center of everything we do we launched the firms first ever credit card platform in partnership with apple and generated over million in net revenues across our broader consumer banking business we completed the initial build of our digital transaction banking platform and processed over trillion of payments on behalf of the firm our platform rollout to third party clients remains planned for the first half of this year we acquired united capital bolstering our capabilities to provide a full spectrum of wealth management services to individuals we realigned our investing businesses into a cohesive unit to support our alternatives growth platform we enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of the firm by integrating major portions of our operations and engineerings teams into our businesses and we strengthened our engineering capabilities with strategic hires of a new chief technology officer and a cochief information officer and added talent across the firm importantly we made significant investments to expand our client franchise grow and diversify our revenues and operate more efficiently including these investments our overall performance was solid even though our investments reduced our returns in we are confident that they are improving the longterm profitability of goldman sachs turning to the operating environment on page in the fourth quarter we had solid engagement with our institutional clients and strong growth with our individual clients notwithstanding corporate client sentiment remained more measured during the quarter we saw steadily rising asset prices improvement in the secured funding markets as the federal reserve took steps to bring stability throughout the quarter and particularly over yearend we also saw progress to a brexit resolution following the uk general election and improvements in the uschina trade tensions including the phase one agreement these conditions contributed to a support of marketmaking backdrop relative to a year ago looking forward our economists continue to expect global gdp growth in excess of over the next two years in the us the fourth quarter provided a backdrop of solid growth evidenced by a steepening yield curve and continued strong consumer sentiment conditions remain supported by the federal reserves three midcycle rate cuts in going forward we expect us growth to continue to run at about given robust labor markets low inflation and strong wage growth in europe growth continues to remain relatively low given manufacturing weakness however in china trade headwinds appear to have moderated with both monetary and fiscal stimulus supporting growth estimates of nearly while we continue to monitor economic data and emerging geopolitical risks including escalating us iran tensions based on what we see today we remain optimistic that the current constructive environment for economic growth can continue next i would like to take a moment to discuss the situation with 1mdb as we mentioned last quarter we are in ongoing discussions relating to a potential settlement of issues related to 1mdb with the relevant authorities across multiple jurisdictions including most notably the us and malaysia given the nature of these negotiations we determined the need to take a litigation charge in the fourth quarter as i noted earlier our legal provision in the quarter was billion with the preponderance related to 1mdb while there can be no assurance of the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 reaching a settlement or the timing if we do our conversations with authorities are progressing and remain active we are working hard to bring closure to this matter as quickly as possible as ive said in the past we do not believe this matter is representative of our longstanding values over the past several years we have taken the time to be selfcritical and reflective to ensure that our culture of integrity collaboration and escalation only improves from this experience these efforts will continue lastly before passing it over to stephen i would like to briefly address our upcoming investor day which will be held on wednesday january through a series of presentations from john stephen and me and our business and control side leadership we hope to provide our stakeholders additional insight into the firms strategic direction we will provide a detailed review of our strategic priorities by business including new products and services that we have highlighted to you previously we will also provide financial targets and goals by which our progress can be measured we hope you will join us for the day either in person or via webcast with that i will turn it over to stephen stephen m scherr chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc thank you david lets turn to page before reviewing our financial results id like to spend a moment discussing our new financial disclosure on january we announced a realignment of our segments which form the basis of our earnings presentation today we now report the following four businesses investment banking global markets asset management and consumer wealth management we believe our revised financial reporting reflects our ongoing commitment to transparency the segments more closely aligned to how we now manage the firm with clear lines of management responsibility and leadership over each segment the segments importantly also reflect how we serve our key clients including corporations governments institutions and individuals and lastly the segments provide for greater accountability in the execution of our forward strategy as our initiatives are executed and reported importantly i would note the key structural change to eliminate the investing lending segment is consistent with our business strategy and will allow you to track our lending and financing activities alongside the relevant businesses as well as to allow our progress in a more transparent way also of note and consistent with our broad commitment to transparency we elected not to create a corporate segment this is a different approach than many of our peers who retained costs or capital at the corporate level we believe our process of allocating all firmwide costs and capital is a prudent management tool and a more comprehensive way of evaluating the true performance of our businesses next let me itemize several of the more significant elements of our segment changes which we listed in our recent 8k filing as i mentioned the most significant change was the elimination of investing lending now the results of our lending and financing activities are included within each of the four segments for example corporate lending activity is included in our investment banking segment this encompasses relationship lending transactionrelated financing and broader lending to our corporate clients secured or collateralized financing activity on behalf of institutional clients of our securities business is now reflected in ficc and equities financing within our global markets segment lending related to our alternativesinvesting businesses including investments in debt securities and real estate credit is reflected in the asset management the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 segment and lending to our individual clients across all wealth bands is in the consumer wealth management segment additionally we now report the firms onbalance sheet equity credit and real estate investing activities in our asset management segment this segment houses both gsam and our merchant banking activities for asset management clients supporting our thirdparty alternatives business expansion consolidating our onbalance sheet and thirdparty asset management investing activities is consistent with our forward strategy to that end this segment includes management and incentive fees associated with asset management clients across the full spectrum of asset classes from cash to alternatives and will also include the impact of quarterly valuation changes the balance sheet positions held in public and private equity investments another significant change is additional disclosure in our new consumer wealth management segment including wealth management fees incentive fees private banking and lending revenues as well as consumer banking revenues this segment houses our longstanding private wealth business as well as our newer consumer offerings broadly speaking and as i noted earlier the new segments align with the client orientation of the firm investment banking global markets and asset management encompass the firms engagement with corporates governments and institutions and consumer wealth management includes our engagement with individuals with that as background let me review the financial results of the firm on the basis of our new segments starting on page investment banking produced fourth quarter net revenues of billion up versus the third quarter but down versus a robust fourth quarter last year for the full year investment banking net revenues were billion our second highest ever down from a record reflecting lower industry deal volumes fourth quarter financial advisory revenues of million were up sequentially but down versus last year consistent with lower industry volumes in we participated in trillion of announced transactions and closed deals for nearly trillion of deal volume contributing to our number one ma league table rankings looking forward conditions for continued ma activity remain solid client dialogues are healthy financing markets are open and we are seeing active interest across a variety of sectors we also continue to see strength in our backlog coming into the new year notwithstanding solid revenue bookings from deal closings in the fourth quarter moving to underwriting equity underwriting net revenues of million were up versus the third quarter and up versus last year for the year we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting supported by billion of deal volume across more than transactions during the quarter where we saw particular strength in our us and european equity businesses we participated in leadership roles on several of the largest public offerings turning to debt underwriting net revenues were million up versus the third quarter and up from a year ago reflecting higher assetbacked and leverage finance activity our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our number two high yield league table ranking revenues from corporate lending were million these revenues relate to a net billion funded portfolio of corporate loans now held in investment banking as well as our portfolio of corporate lending commitments as background there are three components to our corporate lending portfolio relationship lending to our corporate clients credit extensions for strategic activity including acquisition financing and lending to our broadening footprint of corporate clients where we target attractive returns looking forward given our active level of strategic dialogue our expanding client footprint and strong corporate relationships we remain optimistic the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 about the continued level of commercial engagement by our corporate clients aided by the current backdrop of wellfunctioning and constructive capital markets moving to global markets on page net revenues were billion in the fourth quarter up versus last year our growth was driven by a better market backdrop in ficc versus the end of last year and strong performance in our equities businesses for the full year global markets generated billion of net revenues up versus driven by stronger ficc and higher equity financing performance in the fourth quarter ficc net revenues were billion up sequentially and up yearoveryear our growth versus last year was driven by higher ficc intermediation revenues where we saw better performance as well as higher ficc financing revenues notably in repo four out of five of our ficc marketmaking businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the continued strength of our client centric model and improved diversification of our business mix our rates franchise in the us performed particularly well as we executed on behalf of our clients and navigated the broader market environment effectively in commodities our business performed well across the board driven by significantly stronger performance in oil natural gas and power and investor products in mortgages net revenues rose aided by strong client activity and performance in agency securities in currencies net revenues improved versus last year amid a better geopolitical backdrop despite lower volatility we saw strong performance and activity around the general election in the uk and saw healthy corporate deal contingent hedging activity in the quarter lastly in credit we saw better investment grade performance in the us and emea offset by lower client activity as we have discussed previously we are working to further improve wallet share with each of our clients across both risk intermediation and financing while investing to expand our capabilities to automate workflows serve our clients electronically and deliver structured solutions in efficient formats turning to equities on page net revenues for the fourth quarter were billion down versus the third quarter but up versus a year ago equities intermediation net revenues of million rose versus a year ago on stronger cash revenues in the us and asia and strong performance in lowtouch and blocktrading partially offset by lower derivatives activity equities financing revenues of million were up yearover year reflecting improved spreads and higher client balances financing activity remains a strategic priority for the business given it has historically exhibited attractive returns and considerable adjacent benefits to our broader equities franchise particularly for our growing systematic client base moving to asset management on page collectively our asset management activities produced net revenues of billion in the fourth quarter up versus last year driven by stronger equity investment performance for the full year asset management generated net revenues of billion in line with the strong as growth in equity investment revenues offset lower incentive fees fourth quarter management and other fees related to client assets under supervision totaled million up versus a year ago offset by lower incentive fees across the asset management segment we managed aus totaling trillion at yearend and we will cover firmwide aus trends in a few moments next our equity investments generated record quarterly net revenues in the fourth quarter of billion up significantly versus last year driven by gains on our public and private investments approximately of the gains were eventdriven including sales or marks on public securities as we took advantage of harvesting opportunities the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 the fourth quarter showed material improvement relative to the third quarter where we experienced headwinds on certain large equity positions including avantor tradeweb wework and uber during the fourth quarter those positions taken together rebounded and for the full year produced gains of approximately million in the quarter we also exited our position in uber and reduced our position in tradeweb our public portfolio was billion at yearend where appropriate we will continue to reduce the size of certain positions in the public portfolio net revenues from lending activities in asset management were million and primarily relate to loans backed by commercial and residential real estate lending revenues include net interest income and marktomarket gains on debt investments on page turning to consumer wealth management we produced billion of revenues in the fourth quarter up versus a year ago that driven by our leading ultrahigh net worth business ayco and our newly acquired united capital highnet worth business and our consumer banking businesses for the full year consumer wealth management generated net revenues of billion essentially unchanged versus a year ago as strong consumer banking growth and higher management and other fees offset lower incentive fees for the quarter wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of million up versus last year reflecting organic growth and the united capital acquisition assets under supervision rose to billion at yearend we also saw lower incentive fees while private banking and lending revenues were relatively stable consumer banking revenues were million in the fourth quarter up more than versus last year reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and higher loan balances consumer deposits at yearend totaled billion across the us and uk up nearly versus last year funded consumer loan balances totaled approximately billion of which billion were from marcus consumer loans and billion from credit card lending the slowing pace of growth in our marcus unsecured loan business reflected the anticipated growth in our credit card lending from the launch of apple card while still in early stages of growth our consumer business generated a total of million in revenues for the firm this year from a standing start just three years ago now lets turn to page for our firmwide assets under supervision total client assets for which we earn a management fee including those in asset management and consumer wealth management totaled a record trillion in the fourth quarter up billion versus the third quarter and billion versus a year ago our growth was driven by billion of longterm feebased net inflows from fixed income and equity including the acquisition of united capital billion of liquidity net inflows and billion of market appreciation switching gears on page lets address net interest income and our lending portfolio total firmwide nii was billion for the fourth quarter up sequentially and yearoveryear driven by loan growth this nii measure is more comprehensive than the one we previously highlighted in debt il and most notably now includes all nii from global markets activities for the full year we reported nii of billion up driven by deposit and loan growth in consumer wealth management increased lending in investment banking as well as more lending activity in global markets next lets review loan growth and credit performance our total loan portfolio was approximately billion up approximately billion sequentially and up billion versus a year ago with the yearoveryear increase encompassing corporate commercial real estate wealth management and apple card loans the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 our provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was million up million versus last quarter driven primarily by idiosyncratic wholesale impairments and loan growth in our apple card portfolio provisions related to our marcus portfolio were modestly lower quarteroverquarter our firmwide net chargeoff ratio increased by basis points sequentially to approximately basis points in the fourth quarter our losses remain in line with our expectations given the current point in the cycle we continue to monitor the portfolio and broader risk factors and believe our credit exposure remains appropriately sized we also take note that in we will experience a full year of loan loss provisioning related to growth in the apple card portfolio this growth in provisions will occur under the new cecl accounting standard which requires reserves for the expected life of loan importantly the reserve build for growing credit card portfolio does not reflect actual economic losses incremental reserve build will depend on loan growth but given our expectations for card growth we expect our total firmwide loan loss provision to be higher than in with regard to cecl adoption based on our loan portfolio as of yearend we expect to record a day one increase to our reserves of approximately million in the first quarter which will not impact our income statement or eps this will result in a onetime aftertax reduction to retained earnings of approximately million which for regulatory capital purposes will be phased in over the prescribed transition period next lets turn to expenses on page our total operating expenses of billion increased billion versus the fourth quarter of last year reflecting higher compensation and litigation expense in the quarter as well as our continued investment for growth on compensation as we have said in the past our philosophy remains to pay for performance and we are committed to compensating top talent our full year compensation ratio of is roughly flat versus and our compensation expenses were flat yearoveryear over the course of we reduced compensation expenses across many of our businesses to improve operating efficiency and to support incremental compensation expenses related to our growth initiatives where revenue production is beginning to materialize as we have said in the past longer term we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses on noncompensation expense our cost for the full year rose versus last year with litigation expenses and investment spend contributing to that growth specifically litigation expenses accounted for basis points of the percentage increase while investments in technology and new businesses including specifically marcus apple card transaction banking and united capital added another basis points we also incurred additional expenses from our consolidated investments for the full year the total pretax impact of our organic business projects including marcus apple card and transaction banking is approximately million resulting in a drag of roughly basis points on our roe at investor day we will talk more about our plans for these businesses to scale over the coming years and how we expect them to be accretive to our returns for the full year our efficiency ratio was which includes a basis point impact from litigation expense finally on taxes our reported tax rate was for the fourth quarter and for the year our tax rate this quarter reflected the impact of updated guidance from the us treasury regarding the beat tax and incorporates the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 an adjustment to prior quarterly accruals relating to this guidance given this updated guidance we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately turning to select balance sheet data on slide lets begin with capital our common equity tier ratio was using the standardized approach down basis points sequentially driven by lower shareholders equity our ratio under the advanced approach increased by basis points to due to enhancements in loss given default severity modeling that were favorable to the ratio our slr of was flat sequentially during the full year we returned a total of billion of capital to common shareholders through both share repurchases and common stock dividends our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of million shares down over from our peak in our book value per share was up versus a year ago as you will recall our share repurchase authorization for the ccar cycle beginning in the third quarter of was billion or billion a quarter in the third quarter we repurchased only million carrying forward the unused authorization in the fourth quarter we repurchased billion utilizing approximately million of the prior quarters unutilized capacity going forward we carry a repurchase authorization of approximately billion over the next six months as we make capital return decisions we will continue to balance our priorities of prudent capital management and the return of capital in excess of what is needed for investment that is shareholder accretive as such the magnitude of our forward repurchases will as always depend on our earnings capital levels and competing investment opportunities now turning to the balance sheet total assets ended the year at billion essentially unchanged versus the third quarter and up versus last year driven by higher client activity and areas of growth across the firm on the liabilities side our total deposits increased to billion up billion versus last year while our total unsecured longterm borrowings were billion down billion over the same period over the full year we refinanced approximately billion of parent vanilla debt maturities with approximately billion of issuance relying more significantly on our growth in retail and other deposits as we continue to diversify our funding sources this trend toward deposit growth and reduction in unsecured longterm borrowings should continue before taking questions i would like to spend a moment to discuss the billion organic growth initiative announced in that initiative comprised a number of important efforts on which we continue to execute including client expansion in investment banking wallet share growth in global markets consumer loan and deposit growth lending and financing deployment and asset management growth as we go forward we will continue to execute on these initiatives but our focus and communication will instead reflect more ambitious firmwide performance targets to be introduced on investor day we will not be focused on revenue targets but rather on returns and efficiency consistent with our broader longterm strategic plans to drive shareholder value these targets will also reflect growth opportunities that were not included in the original billion such as transaction banking and credit cards we look forward to discussing our new targets in detail at the end of the month in conclusion our fourth quarter was strong leading to full year performance that was in line with the evolving macro environment and reflective of our continued investment in new businesses we aim to operate more the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 efficiently and drive higher returns in the future and look forward to sharing our medium and longterm objectives at investor day in approximately two weeks time with that thanks again for dialing in and well now open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions audio gap and your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much i dont know what to expect on this one so doing more lending across the franchise and it clearly is working and you now break out for us intermediation versus financing in trading or in markets and i think theres opportunity to do more there some of your peers do a lot more on the financing side so the small question is are we going to see more at investor day in terms of metrics that we can help model and build and evaluate performance on and thats question one on that and question two on that is can how quickly can you expect those to a grow and b enhance returns over the next year or two stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks glenn its stephen ill take your question i guess on the small question you asked which is should you expect more disclosure and the frequency of it i think the answer is ultimately yes as it relates to lending broadly around the firm there are a number of categories of lending that will over time become more material and as they become more material we will both by obligation but equally by interest look to provide incremental more information on that lending i would say consumer is a good example of that as between unsecured consumer lending and equally what were doing on the credit card side i think broadly speaking in lending i would say mindful of the cycle our clear plan is to grow financing revenues in both ficc and equities to answer your direct question and i would say the type of lending thats going on there is largely in the repo business in ficc its in prime in equities i think from a credit risk point of view we like and can digest and evaluate that risk notwithstanding where we sit in the cycle more broadly and i think metrics in global markets around that lending again will continue to grow out last thing ill say as it relates to investor day look were going to lay out certain targets at the enterprise level we will be more disclosive about individual businesses but i think equally important investor day will be the beginning and not the end of a dialogue around this so that the numbers just dont standalone and we give you context for rate of growth and how were managing it the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay i appreciate anything there and then on the expanding the corporate client base the specific question i have is are you fully cut over on processing goldmans cash management payments and where are we in terms of dialogue with signing on any clients david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so in transaction banking as we have said from its inception we would be the first customer and then we would look to bring on clients of the firm we are the first customer and i think as was mentioned during the script we have been processing payments on behalf of the firm across five currencies and totaling about trillion in terms of whats getting processed and so thats going well and the firm is obviously benefiting from that as in to the extent that we keep as a customer lower operational deposits on deposit with commercial banks in that regard we have all along been in dialogue with clients of the firm first in the context of getting their sense and input as to what this platform ought to look like how would we design it so as to meet pain points that they are experiencing that collaborative engagement has been going on and we are now engaging these clients as future customers of the firm in the context of transaction banking with certain of them already putting operational deposits on deposit with the bank and i think as weve said in youll see that client roster and that participation in the business grow operator your next question is from the line of christian bolu with autonomous please go ahead christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning david and stephen firstly thank you for the new disclosure its very helpful my first question is on credit provisions it looks like about a third of the credit provisions are and the vast majority of sequential quarter increase in provisions came from the asset management division but when i look at sort of the nii disclosure on page it looks like only of nii comes from asset management so not sure what the mismatch is there but just let me just step back here a little bit help us understand what exact kind of lending goes on in the asset management division maybe a bit more color on the credit quality there and the overall return profile of that portfolio david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks christian for the question so let me start with kind of the geography and the segment so in our asset management business sits alternatives lending so think about that as a portion of the old debt il so this is mezz and lending thats made on a principle basis so what you see reflected in that line is both net interest income thats derived from those assets and equally volatility in the valuation of those debt assets themselves so that describes the geography of it in terms of what played out over the course of the year in provisioning so the delta in provisioning for the full year was million about million of that was found in the consumer wealth management business and the vast majority of that was related to provisioning to the growth in apple card i should point out it was not related to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 any either impairments or off model if you will provisioning related to the balance of the consumer business it was related to growth in apple card the balance of the million call it million or so related to impairments on loans across a variety of different segments asset management being one investment banking being the other and that was around corporate wholesale credit it involved impairments across a range of different industries most notably in energy some in manufacturing none of which were material in the context of the firm and so thats the way the provisioning divided up as between impairments and loan loss provisioning for the growth largely in the apple card portfolio christian bolu q analyst autonomous research okay thank you helpful david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure christian bolu q analyst autonomous research maybe stepping back on the balance sheet as a whole youre kind of sitting close to trillion which is more or less kind of the highest level since the financial crisis in so just help us understand just broadly speaking whats driving growth and sort of the returns youre getting for deploying incremental balance sheet and then just longer term how critical is balance sheet growth to driving revenue growth and how does that sort of factor your longer term thinking around capital return stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i would say a couple of things first as a general matter our balance sheet growth is itself purely a function of being in the service of client demand so were guided entirely by where demand lies for client petitioning of the firm in the context of the flow of our business so over the course of we deployed balance sheet by example against repo where there was demand for liquidity particularly in the context of the various uncertainty that existed in the repo market we grew balance sheet so as to stand as an intermediary of liquidity for our clients so it grows as a function of client demand i think as we think about areas of balance sheet growth we think about it purely in the context of accretive returns for the firm its not a revenuedriven proposition it is really about can we deploy balance sheet on behalf of clients so as to generate accretive returns to the firm and thats kind of the true north if you will thats where the compass points in terms of how our balance sheet ultimately fluctuates and candidly as the cfo i look at balance sheet much as i do liquidity or any other resource around the firm as allocating in the pursuit of accretive growthoriented opportunities and shareholder return for our stakeholders operator your next question is from the line of michael carrier with bank of america please go ahead the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning and thanks for taking the questions maybe first just revenue trends were strong in the quarter i think you mentioned corporate sentiment is still a bit muted which i think can take more time so just curious if youre seeing any improvement on the corporate front and then on the institutional side were there any asset purchases during the quarter that had much impact on global markets david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks for the question michael theres no question i think that the environment during the course of the year improved as the year went on and while id say corporate sentiment has still lagged a little particularly given some of the macro overlays like uschina trade et cetera theres no question in the fourth quarter the environment improved based on the data or information we can see across activity and dialogue with clients i would say that its improved in the fourth quarter and the trends that were seeing early into are a little bit more positive and so those would be the usual things that we could look at across activity set with respect to your second question there were no material asset purchases that impacted global markets michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay and then just quick followup on the efficiency ratio im sure you guys will get into that in two weeks and there is a lot of noise this quarter but i think in the past you mentioned i think kind of being the height of investments i just want to get an update on does that still pertain and we should start to see some improvement on the efficiency ratio as the revenues in some of the newer areas start to gain traction stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks michael so on the efficiency ratio at investor day in my presentation i will go through kind of that migration and give you the elements of it obviously it feeds both in the context of revenue and expense and so well go through that in terms of your question on the height of investment i have said and would reiterate here that is the depth of investment when you look at investment across three of our discrete products namely marcus apple card and transaction banking and equally id made that reference and again reiterate here excluding the reserve calculation which i obviously spoke of in the context of the prepared remarks so when you look at the investment ex reserve for those three initiatives is the lower point and i think well start to see reduced expenditures relating to that i would say that overall and then again this relates back a bit to your efficiency question my expectation around noncompensation expense ex litigation is that it would run roughly flat in relative to where we are the whole ambition of what were doing around expenses is trying to create operating leverage and efficiency so as to continue to fund investments around the firm and thats not investment limited to the three products that i spoke about but equally across technology investment around the infrastructure of the firm and the like and so well start to see that play out obviously in the context of flat expenses yearoveryear our hope and expectation the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 is that well start to see higher revenue generation from some of these investments which will play out positively in the context of the efficiency ratio itself operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off just digging into some of the new segment disclosures particularly the consumer wealth side of the business and clearly what stood out most to us and you alluded to this earlier in the call was the pre tax margin running much lower somewhere close to clearly the new business initiatives the significant drag that thats had on the margin is quite evident but i was hoping you could speak to what inning youre in currently just in terms of the platform build out and new investment for that strategy specifically and just through the cycle how we could think about longterm pretax margin potential for that segment as you continue to scale and maybe begin to run a bit closer to some of the peer comps stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure so let me answer the question generally we have disclosed obviously information around expenses and pretax our intention at investor day is to go to pretax margin and returns across the whole of the business and then in the context that that will provide you in investor day our intent is to continue to do that on quarterly earning calls like this so you should have an expectation that well continue along that path id also say and ill reflect on this here generally but more specifically in our investor day our intent is not to leave you in the dark as to the consumer wealth management segment in terms of overall margins meaning we want to give you a sense of where the wealth business sits that is the pwm business which obviously demonstrates a much higher margin than what the segment reveals with the segment being in effect burdened by the continued growth in investment spend in the consumer space so we will separate that out my guidance to you in terms of expectation is that the wealth management segment or subsegment within that performs at a much more market level margin than the way in which the segment otherwise illustrates but again we will decompose that for you with context as we move forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 no thats great to hear stephen and just one followup from me as it relates to the provision appreciate the detail you provided in earlier question the guidance calling for higher provision in i dont think that comes as a big surprise to anyone but just given expectations for a healthy step up in provision simply due to cecl implementation and some consumer loan seasoning i was hoping you could maybe help us frame a bit better whats a reasonable provision level or run rate expectation if theres change in the macro but we simply have to reflect the impact of cecl with an assumption that youll see relatively steady growth in consumer loans stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah look i think generally speaking our own budget is in the realm of call it billion to billion in terms of a broader budget i would say a lot of that reflects continued growth in the apple card portfolio as well as lending more generally but again as you grow from a negligible level at the inception through to what we hold both in terms of roughly billion of where we are and what that growth will be in the ensuing year obviously that provision through will be exaggerated youll see it that way but thats just part of the overall growth as an aside the provisioning growth related to apple card again more from a standing start is itself burdened by cecl relative to where provisioning would have been so its marginally more exaggerated in the context of the life of loan component to cecl and the like now what i offer you by way of budget is just that it obviously will depend on the pace of loan growth broadly the pace of loan growth in apple card which we are going to calibrate based purely on risk parameters and our own judgment about the tone and nature of the market in which were operating operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hey betsy hi stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i had a its a little bit of a philosophical question around lending and how youre thinking about your various loan books and the question is kind of coming from the perspective that im thinking youve been working with a balance sheet thats a high velocity balance sheet and im wondering if you perceive your various loan books as moving more from a velocity balance sheet towards a storage balance sheet is there anything in there im thinking about do you hedge some of your loan books now are there some that youre going to continue to hedge some that you would not consider hedging does it impact how we think about the capital and the capital the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 allocation to loans im wondering if that resonates at all with how youre thinking about the loan books in the various stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc segments stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah no no no its a very good question id say the following first theres nothing about what were doing in growing our loan book particularly around consumer for example that is in effect substitution for business that well continue to do of a capital markets orientation around lending so for example and we look at the two consistent with trends that each market shows and kind of risk parameters and levers that we hold to manage risk ill give an example if you think about corporate lending so for example lending we make by way of acquisition financing that we provide to our clients what i look at in the context of our deal book has a lot to do with size but equally with velocity turn so right now our deal book turns at inside of three months thats an important metric to think about as we manage corporate lending and capital markets related lending thats going on thats less of a relevant consideration if you will in the context of growth in our consumer loan book or what we do around apple card as a component of that there were quite careful to consider what we do about provisioning how we think about the qualitative overlay to the size of our provisioning as we look at a maturation of that portfolio start to look at more onpremise data as it relates to our consumer portfolio as opposed to third party metrics and so we think about these two things in some sense differently in terms of what you apply by way of the rigor and metric and overlay in managing that risk but equally we obviously look at the totality of lending thats going on and the rate of growth as it relates to the overall balance sheet in the firm itself so i hope thats helpful and sort of our broad philosophical approach to lending betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and does it then come back towards capital and what kind of capital ratios you need what im hearing is on the consumer side maybe more capital consumptive but obviously theres an roa associated with that that should pay for it whereas on the banking side that velocity suggests that it might not be as capital consumptive as commercial whole loan in a different organization stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah in a way id answer that question again to sort of stick to sort of a broad view of it all from the firm were driving and growing new businesses at the firm that inevitably will carry with them more durable and recurring fee revenue they therefore will by definition carry with it less stress loss in the context of it they will in some sense the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 be less capital dense than where they have been and so were going to evaluate risk return against the capital thats required against each individual business and render judgments there as to what those returns look like on a capital adjusted basis where we want to deploy capital where we dont i guess what im suggesting to you is its a much more dynamic process than not but overall it fits within the component of growing and building businesses that have less stress draw and therefore the potential for lower density from a capital perspective operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi stephen i think you said noncomp should be flat in but in almost every noncomp category went higher so is that specifically because just why is that is the question whats changing stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so mike maybe the way to answer that is let me decompose a little bit of the growth yearoveryear in noncomp expense so as you know we reported a increase in noncomp expense about was related to litigation im not going to sort of foreshadow of where that will be but just understand in the component of growth of the was just that about another to was related to broader investment around the firm whether thats tech investment consumer transaction banking and united capital now thats going to grow but that segment of noncomp expense is going to start to sort of graduate off as those businesses start to hit a certain level of maturity and as i have said were looking to prune expenses all around the firm so as to create operating leverage and fund the continue investment expense thats there and then finally i would say there are certain elements of investment entities and other components of expense growth in noncomp that equally will come off over time so i just draw that out what i do want to tell you is that as we get to investor day were going to give you a certain expense target that were going to look to harvest out of the firm in very concrete terms that will help feed what ive been describing which is an objective of creating capacity for reinvestment in the firm over time and so thats why when i guide you that direction as being flat it is consistent with creating that capacity there will be growth some of the growth will come off others will be funded by capacity we create in and around the firm mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thats helpful and then just one big picture question both david and you stephen mentioned well functioning and constructive capital markets you said the trends early in are more positive i guess why do you think thats the case and do you think this time its different versus the past decade do you think these improvements are sustainable or not or whats your level of conviction in other words we havent heard you on the earnings call david or stephen for a long period of time so we cant tell your relative constructiveness on the market so just a little more color on that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc all right well i appreciate the question mike and i dont know that i can help you with my relative ill try to reiterate some of the things that i said and hopefully it will be helpful context so i do think the economic environment at the moment is constructive what i said on the call about the us economy and our expectation of growth of about in we have relatively high conviction on i can give you a set of things from a macro or the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 geopolitical perspective that could change which would significantly shock confidence and therefore change that picture but i think the chance of that happening in at this point seems low its not zero but it doesnt seem likely i think that theres been a slight improvement and thats what i said when i was asked earlier when we were talking about corporate sentiment a slight improvement in corporate sentiment as we came to the end of the year and there was some progress in the year on some of the macro overhang that would have a tendency to affect corporate sentiment and so i think you have a slightly more positive corporate sentiment heading into and i do see some indications around deal activity that look a little stronger in the fourth quarter and as we step into the first quarter of this year so i do think its constructive i made comments with respect to sluggishness in europe but a little bit more constructive on china again with a little bit of a clearing of the uschina as a step forward that might remove some slight headwinds but i dont know how to give you a relative i think our general point of view is on the distribution of outcomes the highly most likely outcome is we have a relatively benign economic environment in operator your next question is from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just a quick followup on the target around the noncomp and your expectations i think stephen you had said that you expect it to be flat from here just to clarify is that from here noncomp for the full year of exlitigation or is that the run rate exlitigation stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc no i would say its in the exlitigation kind of where we stand on the full year brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you very much stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc and then another one on expenses curious about comp and whether or not there might have been some noise in the comp ratio this year that was an elevated level of partners retiring did that have any impact on that metric here this year or less so david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hi thanks for the question brennan no with respect to the comp ratio partner retirements and the movement of partners in and out of the firm had no impact on the comp ratio i would just comment because i have seen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 some commentary on this when we look at the movement of partners through the cycle the twoyear cycle of partners and we have an election coming up this fall there is nothing about the movement in that looks different to us than the movement we have seen over the first year of the last number of cycles so we have movement in our partnership its part of the culture of the partnership that younger partners have brought up and despite some of the dialogue around it we dont see anything significant about the movement of partners at this point in the cycle operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc hey good morning maybe we can talk a little bit about your expansion of the alternatives business and just maybe talk a little bit about the efforts to accelerate that growth and if there will be any kind of balance sheet usage associated with that or is it really going to be just sort of aum growth david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so what weve tried to do and at the investor day well give you more color on this and kind of walk you through a plan around it weve run an alternative business that has been some client capital and balance sheet capital and in the context of that client capital and balance sheet capital the business has been housed in multiple different businesses spread across the firm we have now brought all those businesses together in one business and we have put together and are moving forward with a plan to significantly increase the institutional client money that we manage with that infrastructure around the globe historically we have managed some institutional money but we have managed very significant private wealth money in addition to using our balance sheet on a goforward basis we dont plan to grow the balance sheet but we will continue to use balance sheet but we will remix that balance sheet so that the rwa density is different and its less capital intensive but the primary growth plan for the business is to over time raise a significantly increased amount of institutional capital that appreciates the fact that our consolidated alternative platform is broad global and deep and that we operate in all the different categories private equity growth equity credit infrastructure real estate and we also do it all over the world and have resources all over the world to execute on that and that is very attractive to the large institutional capital raisers and we have not traditionally attacked or partnered with them across this broad platform and so at investor day well give you more color on how we plan to do that and what you can expect from that over the coming five years james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc thats really helpful is there any challenge or do you find in competing with your more pureplay competitors that are publicly traded do you think theres some sort of disadvantage in raising institutional money having your hands in other businesses or you dont think thats an issue david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well we have been in these businesses for years and we have executed well in these businesses for years we have also been a leader in providing services to those businesses that you refer to we have an active dialogue with those companies about our activities and what we plan to do and john stephen and i are the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 extremely focused on the client orientation and the client nature in the context of the way we run the firm the other firms that are out there have very very ambitious institutional capital raising plans from institutions but theres a lot of capital to allocate and were very comfortable that they can raise a lot of capital we can raise a lot of capital whats interesting about this business is this is a business that actually is growing secularly and so we think were very well positioned given where we are both to participate but also to continue to service those clients in a differentiated and valueadded way operator your next question is from the line of chris kotowski with oppenheimer please go ahead chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah actually my question was related to that last one which is looking at the asset management segment and billion of mainly private equity investments i guess the question is if you put it in the context of the publicly traded alternatives blackstone has a pretty big business and their gp investments is about billion by comparison and so what is the strategic need for and rationale for keeping that large of a balance sheet commitment david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so we have a differentiated model and theres no question that blackstone operates the business with no capital if maybe we were starting today from scratch with a white sheet of paper you might develop the business differently but whats happened because of the way we run our business is we have built out a very very broad deep global network of investors all over the world and we think thats a real asset to capital allocators we have done that because we have built up strength investing off our balance sheet and historically candidly one of the things investors have liked is they like the fact that we partner with them and we have skin in the game and were committed to investments with them that alignment i think is a very very good thing and i think that will be a differentiated component of our strategy here and so strategically thats something i think that differentiates us in the context of the strategy also as we grow new products and services in the space around the world and add to what were doing it is easier to fund the acceleration of that if you do have the capacity to use balance sheet to jumpstart some of those businesses so again going back to what i said before we would not expect the balance sheet to grow we would expect to change the rwa density by shifting some out of equity into more credit or infrastructuretype assets but we think we have a competitive advantage or a different strategy thats a good advantage to partner with our clients and we plan to continue it chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thats it for me thank you operator your next question is from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david and stephen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hey devin david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey i guess first question here so i saw the marcus app was rolled out last week and im just curious what took so long i guess to get that out and how are you thinking about integrating that with some of the other products in consumer and really integrating it with clarity money in that app as well and really the question is im just trying to understand some of the branding in consumer and what youre going to be using call it as a digital storefront stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc so on the marcus app when we first began marcus three years ago you will recall that our two products were deposits and unsecured loans so the utility of the app early on was not quite high meaning people who carry a loan are not looking to check on it with the frequency of those that use apps for their daytoday exchange and so we sort of set a set of priorities for ourselves in terms of the direction we were going to build and we would ultimately come upon the app i would say from the moment we began to think about the design of the app and in fact bringing clarity money into the house the idea was to take the best of the technology that is what clarity money had developed which was super interesting in terms of prompts and the use of intelligence to do that and kind of a twoway engagement with the user or consumer of the app we wanted to embed that in a broader app that we would roll out so youre seeing the first phase of that now particularly as people will start to engage more and more with us again with greater frequency than they did at the start and were embedding the best of what is clarity money in the context of the creation of that app overall and so it was really a question of anticipated use slower at the start faster now a question of priorities and now bringing it together on your question about branding i think ill defer you to investor day when well talk a lot more with much greater context than i could answer in a single question on the branding strategy around consumer and around wealth management more broadly devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific looking forward to that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 and then just a followup here modeling the comp ratio and cadence moving forward so the fourth quarter comp ratio was about basis points below the first quarter level i know thats much tighter than the historical relationship and i also know consistent with how youre now looking to accrue on more of a realtime basis you also had a very strong fourth quarter for equity investment performance which i would think have a lower comp ratio too so im just trying to get some flavor for whether the call that relationship is a decent proxy on a quarterly basis or the stronger fourth quarter in the equity performance maybe skew that a bit lower stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure so let me start from the top as you know our comp and benefits line was flat yearoveryear and our comp to net revenue number was roughly in line slightly higher than where it was last year so thats to look at the full year embedded in your question was in fact the right reference which is as i have said several times we are accruing for compensation each quarter as the accounting standards require which is our best estimate of the compensation we would need and so we have done that much more on a straight line without relying or waiting on the fourth quarter so as to be a bigger adjustment and so youre seeing more straight line because of that youre seeing this fourth quarter variability relative to where we were in the past thats just a function of the way in which we are now accounting again more of a straight line than not i would say just to step back from the particulars i think that from a compensation point of view we had taken payroll and compensation expense down in a number of different businesses over the year in order to redeploy compensation to populations of people that are working on some of the growth businesses that we have by definition that compensation dollar is not producing an equal amount of revenue as it would in other areas it will as those businesses grow and mature and so part of this is a reallocation of compensation in that direction while maintaining comp and benefits at a constant or flat yearoveryear and reflecting in on the comp to net revenue number being roughly flat as well operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i was wondering and you may not be able to answer this question today which is fine and if you cant possibly you may want to give us this detail at investor day but in the regulatory filings for all the banks theres a category of loans called loans to nondepository financial institutions and when we look at that for the top banks like your own the growth has been pretty impressive since and when we look at it for your organization back then it was about billion and today its approximately billion so the question is whats in that portfolio and again if you dont have the details i understand but maybe you could share with us on investor day some good details of whats in that portfolio the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i think i want to give you an answer with some specificity so let me suggest that heather miner and her team get back in touch with you and we can itemize as is publicly disclosed what exactly sits in that category and we can give you some progression of how thats migrated i just dont have the particulars around that to hand gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats okay thats not unusual by the way when we ask this question of other banks most people dont really give us the details but thats fine then the second question can you give us some color obviously the apple card received a wonderful amount of publicity and apple is branded of course as a card created by them and not a bank type of logo the question i have is apple is obviously very respectful of their brand and their customers and in a recession we all know unemployment goes up and we also know that credit card delinquencies are linked to unemployment is there anything that concerns you that as we go into a recession say unemployment goes to delinquencies for all credit cards more than double from where we are today are you going to be hamstrung trying to collect those delinquencies because of the way its been branded as an apple card and as not a bank david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks for the question i want to be really clear on this notwithstanding whoever lays claim to the creation of the card theres only one institution thats making underwriting decisions and thats goldman sachs so goldman sachs is making all of the underwriting decisions as it relates to it we have set targets and goals and objectives along with apple as a good partner would and apple is completely in the know as to sort of how we are going about these underwriting decisions but the ultimate decision sits with us and so we calibratemanage our risks and collections in the context of that and so i think i just want to be really clear about that it is the bank that renders underwriting decisions in that regard operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks ill be quick here it looks like on the consumer side you saw deposits go up about billion this quarter but you seem that you have better growth when you enter into new markets is there any type of geographic expansion that youre planning within the markets business that can kind of accelerate growth on deposits there thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah sure thank you that question has come up frequently obviously the primary growth is in the us in the uk we have seen considerable growth in deposits which has really pleased us even relative to the early expectations we have looked at a variety of other jurisdictions in terms of where we could raise deposits germany as a name has come up several times its natural that it would in the context of brexit and planning and doing more asset generation into our european business i think well wait and see how things progress around brexit the size magnitude and pace of asset growth there before we make a decision about where we the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 next plant the flag from a deposit perspective and so there are no immediate plans in terms of next jurisdiction but we continue to evaluate it and we have built the platform particularly in the uk with embedding greater flexibility for us to open it or open a new jurisdiction without building from ground zero and so it was planned with that in mind operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks stephen m scherr chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc so since there are no more questions i would like just to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we hope to see many of you later this month if any additional question arise in the meantime please do not hesitate to reach out to heather otherwise enjoy the rest of your day and we look forward to speaking with you at investor day operator ladies
