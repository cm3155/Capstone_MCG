executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you sal good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today this morning were going to focus on four topics the flagstar the decision to restructure the mortgage business and our operating performance along with our outlook for the new flagstar was a watershed year for new york community culminating in our acquisition of flagstar our largest acquisition todate which closed on december 1st as you have heard me say many times on these calls and in oneonone meetings this is a transformational acquisition for us and we are already seeing some of the benefits weve outlined when the transaction was first announced the transaction to a dynamic commercial banking model is underway with a more diversified balance sheet which was evident at yearend as commercial loans represented of total loans compared to before the merger announcement legacy flagstar brings a number of new lendingrelated businesses to the new company most of which are ci businesses all of these are higher margin businesses and they are typically tied to floating interest rates these new businesses include a nationallyrecognized mortgage warehouse business where we currently rank number two in the country based on billion of commitments outstanding builder finance is another great business where we do business with of the top builders nationwide the spreads in this marketplace is approaching basis points in that particular business in addition flagstar adds a significant wholesale banking operation focusing on several verticals these loans are conservatively underwritten and also generate significant fee income that legacy nycb did not have going forward we plan to allocate more capital to these higher margin businesses the same is also true on the funding side legacy flagstar contributes a significantly lower cost deposit base including traditional retail deposits and a large amount of commercial balances related to mortgage businesses including escrow balances new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 additionally both companies have a very strong market share position within each of their respective core markets which will aid in acquiring more deposits as we grow the benefits of flagstar deposit base are already evident in the fourth quarter results as noninterestbearing deposits increased to of total deposits compared to prior to the merger announcement another important benefit is to our interest rate sensitivity our sensitivity to interest rate changes has improved materially due to the acquisition as you will recall legacy new your community has historically been liability sensitive while legacy flagstar was significantly asset sensitive on a combined basis the new company will have a more balanced interest rate sensitivity position and we will have more flexibility in managing our sensitivity to market rate changes given the nature of our new asset classes paired with low corresponding mix the new company will be able to enjoy a stronger margin going forward as for our mortgage business we disclosed early today actions aimed to optimize our mortgage platform the substantial and aggressive shift in fed monetary policy over the past year resulted in significantly higher mortgage rates this rapid increase has stifled refinancing activity and also dampened purchase activity while legacy flagstar was proactive throughout in rightsizing its mortgage business the mortgage market is expected to remain challenged in with annual originations volume expected to decline by yearover year to trillion after dropping last year compared to therefore shortly after the transaction closed we made the strategic decision to swiftly restructure the business which occurred late last week to better reflect demand and align to where our strengths lie our distributed retail channel will shift to a branch footprintonly model resulting in a reduction in the number of retail home lending offices mortgage origination head count is expected to decline to less than ftes compared to a high of ftes in headcount reduction represents approximately of total employees at the combined companys previous structuring these decisions are among the most difficult our senior leadership team has to make however they are necessary to ensure the longterm success and viability of our mortgage business these actions are expected to improve profitability in the mortgage business during the current downcycle while still allowing us to participate in the upside in the event the interest rate environment becomes more favorable despite these actions we remain one of the top players in the mortgage business we are a leading bank originator for the mortgages the sixth largest subservicer and the second largest warehouse lender in addition we continue to lend in all six channels and remain committed to the correspondent and broker business turning now to our operating performance despite the significant shift in fed policy last year is still another record year for the company on a nongaap basis we reported fully diluted eps of for full year relatively unchanged compared to the we reported for net income available to common stockholders as adjusted totaled million for full year compared to million in our net income in was a record at that time and in we broke that record while our financials were impacted by one month of combined results legacy new york community performed extremely well with strong organic growth in loans and deposits multifamily loans increased billion or to billion compared to with virtually all of the growth coming organically specialty finance loans rose million or during the year to billion at the same time organic deposit growth was billion up new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 this improved about billion in growth during the fourth quarter related to our government bankingasa service business our fourth quarter net interest margin improved basis points to compared to the prior quarter excluding the impact from prepayment income the fourth quarter margin was to up basis points compared to the previous quarter which is better than our original guidance our credit quality metrics remain solid and reflect the strong credit culture of both legacy organizations npas to total assets equaled basis points while npls to total loans were basis points continuing to rank as among the best in the industry these metrics are proof positive that our conservative underwriting standards have served us well over various business cycles this along with a high quality balance sheets should serve us well in the event of a downturn in the economy as for real estate trends in our primary new york city market the residential rental market remains healthy despite some moderation in the effective median rent due to the weaker performance in the luxury market while our breadandbutter nonluxury rent regulation mix remains very strong manhattan monthly median rent in november rose nearly yearoveryear to up monthovermonth following three straight months of decline and was up above the prepandemic levels on the office front manhattans direct asking rents in the fourth quarter decreased from the third quarter to per square foot while the office availability rate was up or basis points manhattan retail average asking rents recorded a uptick quarteroverquarter to per square foot the first increase since the fourth quarter of due to a resurgence in travel and tourism and consumer demand also as of yearend our capital ratios remain very strong accordingly last week our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share in the companys common stock the dividends payable on february 16th to common shareholders of record as of february 6th based on last nights closing price this reflect a dividend yield of approximately looking forward to this is what you can expect from the new company throughout the year and into first were going to have one brand across the combined organization the divisional bank concept has worked well for legacy nycb while were mostly in the new york city metro region but now that we are one of the largest regional banks in the country with branches in states along with a national presence in several businesses we are confident that a unified brand will position us to thrive we will have one bank one brand one culture our new brand will be flagstar while the flagstar name will remain the associated brand look feel logo purpose and what the name stands for will change we plan to officially roll out the new logo and brand publicly in late but it will not be fully operational and used externally until systems conversion which is scheduled to occur during the first quarter of as for guidance given the current outlook we expect average loan growth of first quarter nim to expand from fourth quarter levels to a range of to including prepayments which are expected to have less of an impact on the nim going forward first quarter gain on sale mortgage loan of million to million full year noninterest expense range of billion to billion excluding mergerrelated expenses and intangible asset amortization and a full year tax rate of approximate finally i would like to send a big shout out to all of our employees at both banks none of what we have accomplished so far would have been possible without their patience support and hard work their commitment new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 to our customers and borrowers over the past several years has truly been remarkable my sincere thanks to them all with that we will be happy to answer any questions you may have we will do our very best to get it all you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first questions come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning good morning so congrats on closing the deal i guess maybe the first question if i heard you correctly tom i think you mentioned systems conversions up until first quarter of sounds a bit longer than usual just wondering if there are any reasons why its going to take that long to move do the systems conversion and secondly just remind us indiscernible cost savings from the franchise and where you think the expense base reset once you have all the expense savings tied to the deal maybe as we think about postconversion what it looks like thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc all right lets start with the latter question first and by the way we apologize for the long delay this morning that was unfortunate but we do apologize for that lets just talk about the overall expense run rate going forward we gave out a guidance level of billion to billion for bear in mind we continue to put the companies together through synergies when we first announced the transaction we estimated about million of merger related cost benefits exclusive of the mortgage business specifically so we kind of called that out when we looked at the combined operation so were assuming that obviously were restructuring mortgage going to that is taking place as we speak so in addition to that we also have the ongoing continuation of synergies throughout and also a substantial benefit most likely in the first quarter going back to the actual system conversion which we have planned this is a full blown conversion of all systems so this is going to be a substantial undertaking for the bank we feel very confident thats the right appropriate timeframe but its going to be our largest conversion and a lot of our core upgrade systems that were getting on a combined basis will be part of that conversion so were taking this process obviously very seriously we want to make sure that we have the appropriate time to integrate so clearly first quarter of is where were targeting new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 i would not expect that to become any early than that so first quarter is the date but a lot of work has been done as far as choices on systems a substantial amount of decisionmaking has gone into whats best for the customer and were changing a lot on the nycb side to upgrade ourselves to be more in the regional bank space and to other technology systems that we dont currently have this goes all into that upgrade so were super excited about the opportunity but its going to take a little bit of time and at the same time i mentioned in my prepared remarks were also going to be rebranding into the first quarter as well so going back to the cost structure i feel highly confident that that range is very reasonable but we feel that historically the company has been in integrated institutions we have a great road map here we spent a lot of time getting to know each other at the same time were building an institution thats going to be very diverse and in our run rate has some buildout of additional well call cost centers that are going to drive revenue opportunities on a combined basis and i think that range is a reasonable range given that we are restructuring mortgage on a combined basis so i think the range that we gave you billion billion hopefully well come in towards the front end of the range but we feel pretty confident about that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess then given all the investments youre making and i think it all makes sense is it fair to assume like thats a steady state you might get some savings for the systems conversion next year but then youre also investing in the franchise thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats a john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc correct thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc fair statement ebrahim we didnt give out guidance ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure yeah thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc but indiscernible a lot of the system conversion will result in significant overlap on technology as well as the benefits for cost savings maybe john if you want to add some more color to that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 yeah i think thats right youll see some of those that million in savings come through over the next couple of months as part of the process were going through and then therell be more as tom just mentioned thatll come once the systems conversions done into in q1 of so i think ebrahim youre right that makes a lot of sense as to where we can kind of see a steady state going forward at least in and thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ebrahim just to go back to the concept of the conversion this is really a transformational transaction for the bank we said it all along were moving towards a commercial banking model and with that commercial banking model there are a lot of technology tools that we are going to implement as part of the combined newco thats whats pushing out the conversion maybe a quarter or two and thats why we feel very confident that the date makes sense for us this is not that historical nycb thrift model we are going to a commercial banking model with unique technology tools that are consistent with regional banks of our size ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood thats helpful and just on a separate question you gave the first quarter nim guide how do we think about the net interest margin and the two scenarios in a world where rates just stay higher for longer how do you think the nim plays out and then indiscernible if rates get cut do you still expect the balance sheet to be liability sensitive and benefit from the nim benefiting from rate cuts thanks thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start the conversation im going to defer to john but big picture were assuming that were going to have probably two more hikes coming in the shortterm and probably a pause and probably looking at the forward curve an adjustment towards november is for the first cut thats really much playing through the forward curve but the reality is that where we stand today on positioning were probably maybe or 5ish liability sensitive going into this most likely pause situation in q1 we have the capacity to move plus or minus very easily so right now just by putting the balance sheet together without any restructuring without any sales of assets sitting here just probably slightly liability sensitive and we have the ability to pivot very quickly so maybe john if you want to add some more color towards the sensitivity on the market rate john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah id just highlight what tom said now that were not as significantly liability sensitive as nycb has been historically it just gives us the opportunity to be able to manage towards a neutral asset base depending on market conditions so slightly liability sensitive now we are forecasting the two rate hikes in february and march which is really whats impacting the margin in the cut at the end of the year really doesnt have much of an impact in the guide ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and tom you mentioned restructuring of the balance sheet like should we be expecting any meaningful restructuring once theres clarity on the path of fed interest rates new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i think the reality is that we put the company together at yearend we had an opportunity to look at some of the assets that in particular mortgage rate that we can structure into an opportunity for liquidity and liquidity is expensive right now so if we go into cash or shortterm securities were not going at zero anymore its around approaching close to assuming two more rate increases so we have flexibility here we believe that eventually when the securitization markets open we have lots of liquidity we can flow through given the assets that were acquired through the flagstar transaction some of those resi portfolios and other asset classes but the reality is it goes back to the opportunity to really deploy capital into higher margin businesses were being very cautious in respect to pricing we have a very interesting opportunity in front of us regarding yields and if you think about our multifamily business theyre averaging in the and the markets closer to right now were not seeing a lot of refinance activity were not seeing a lot of purchase activity what we are seeing is that we still have about billion over the next two years repricing mandatory repricing they have to make a decision and that market is a much higher rate environment assuming the fed holds this for longer i think our customers will have to just go into a different option which will be a higher interest rate to do nothing so well manage through that very carefully were seeing about half of those loans go right into our new product which is a sofr product which is a floating rate product which is great for interest rate risk were endorsing that as a company but we feel very confident that we can move the portfolio to a higher yielding asset class at the same time be very focused on the best yielding opportunities in the marketplace because we have diversification this bank now has a very well diverse vertical opportunity and were going to make sure that we maximize our capital spend to ensure better margins going forward starting the year off with a much stronger margin with the opportunity to redeploy capital into higher margin businesses is an attractive position to be in ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next questions come from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning and congrats tommy i wonder if you could help us think about total fee income in say the first quarter i know its volatile given mortgage bumpiness but help us think about the combined companys fee income capabilities new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so look we have a lot of moving parts here thats new to the company in particular the capital markets activity i think that thats going to be again its not modeled in its not anticipated as part of the synergies of the merger benefits of the merger but we think that now that we have a capital markets division thats going to look at options for our customer base to put on derivatives synthetic positions to hedge their loan products i think thats going to be a great benefit to the bank in addition to that we can also be creative for our multifamily customers as well to offer those similar products and were not going to put on long duration paper without any synthetic position which drives into fee income at the same time im going to defer to lee smith because hes obviously running the mortgage business and thats always going to be a very interesting opportunity if the mortgage business does start to pick up but reality is that were starting at probably the low point so were hoping it doesnt get much worse than this but were starting at the low so maybe lee smith could add some color on fee income between servicing and mortgage production lee lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah thanks tom and we provided this in the guidance so were guiding for q1 gain on loans sale to be between million and million and then the net return on the msr asset were guiding to i think well be at the top end of that range so if you combine those two numbers were sort of in the million million range from a fee income point of view on the mortgage origination side and then weve obviously got loan admin income on the servicing side given our significant subservicing business now from a gaap accounting point of view there is an offset as it relates to the interest we pay on escrows which should really be up in the net interest income line and so were going to get a benefit from that even though you dont quite see from a gaap point of view when we break out the servicing pl you do see that fee income given the significant subservicing business we have thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah so with that being said just to add on to lees commentary assuming there is a fed pause and it moves the other way say towards the end of this year that will also generate higher fee income because now the cost of that liability becomes much lower as we manage that servicing portfolio mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then tommy could you share with us sort of the timing and costs associated with rebranding thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc indiscernible we feel very comfortable that weve done a ton of work over the past two years now on really setting the newco which is going to be the new flagstar a lot of spend has been already taking place as far as the branding efforts for the future more towards than id say where the dollar outlay will come in but where we stand right now money has been spent on setting up the brand itself our vision our mission obviously our position in the marketplace and obviously therell be new signage for all of the locations its all new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 going to be as we said one cohesive brand one culture one name and that will start towards the back end of and with maybe some marketing dollars going to run rate mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co and last question i had for you was on the loantodeposit ratio is there a level at which youd sort of cap that wouldnt exceed thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so mark i would say big picture is that our passion as you can see over the past few years weve done a significant shift in how were funding the balance sheet right theres been a lot more deposit growth were looking at alternative solutions to fund our business thats going to be part of our dna going forward we are focusing on funding this balance sheet very differently than it was historically we want to get away from our dependency on nontraditional funding we believe that various mortgageasaservice businesses our governmentasaservice business are focused at really trying to take the embedded nature of mortgage and go after the clientele as a billion organization could put us in a very unique position to gather more deposits we were very successful a few years back when we started the mandatory initiative of if were going to lend you money we need to have a deposit relationship thats going to be the culture going forward so our passion here is to be less funded wholesale be funded more traditional in nature and were looking at all avenues to bring in a mix of funding that life is better so we can have a much better cost of fund and better stability on our funding mix if you think about the magnitude of our wholesale book of liabilities if you replace that with well call a true core deposit its a gamechanger for multiple so the goal here is to be less dependent on mortgage less dependent on wholesale and focus on multiple expansion over time and thats our passion thats our business model every day its within our dna its not going to happen overnight we said that when i took over as ceo this is culturally where were going and were making that longterm vision of trying to change the dynamic of the traditional thrift model towards a commercial banking model mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ph sure mark operator thank you our next questions comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys and congrats on the deal thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc been a long time david but were very pleased to be here david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah absolutely glad to see it just on the portable advances you guys have is it fair to say that the margin result this quarter and the guide for next quarter includes the repricing of all the like billion or so of those advances that you have at this point so youre not really expecting a cliff repricing of that in or beyond john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah if you look at it i mean we do have a lot of borrowings coming due in so when you look at that amount we have probably just under billion coming due in the first quarter of and thats thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc in the guide yeah john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah thats in the guide thats in the guidance the cost of that is in the million range million range so therell be a bit of a lift there but nothing significant there are portables on the books as you mentioned but theyre spread out on what their lockout dates are so we dont expect to have the cliff issue that we had in the third and the fourth quarter of david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc dave i will just say just to johns point we want to have some flexibility to go into depending on our balance sheet maneuverability depending where rates start to normalize here and we have an opportunity to really look at the assets that weve acquired and see what assets were going to hold there has been no restructuring as of yearend we priced we looked at the marketplace we believe when the marketplace becomes more opportunistic for us to think about maybe reshifting our proceeds into maybe a debt reduction or a debt restructuring thats always on the table well look at what makes sense in the marketplace but clearly having the optionality is going to be important especially with most likely a pause coming and perhaps if the back end of the curve continues to be steep like new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 this we may have some opportunities to take on some cheaper funding at the same time keep some money relatively short to pay down some debt because obviously the shortterm money is very expensive right now so we have that optionality on the table david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah well to your point on reducing the debt just on the deposit side you guys have obviously been working on a number of deposit initiatives that you talked about earlier and in prior calls i was just wondering if can size the new opportunity that you now have post the deal close i know you talked about the warehouse customer deposits that you could go after previously once you closed the deal if you just kind of size that how big that opportunity is at this point and then hit on any other areas that you could point to thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i always said when we announced the transaction i envisioned the embedded nature of just mortgage alone as a billion opportunity i felt highly confident that with lee smiths business regarding the escrow business the loans that we service for others as well as the warehouse business its a tremendous opportunity in respect to the type of credit facility that we offer some of our clients given our size now our balance sheet at billion managing this business and being number two in warehouse in the country gives us a good shot at really bringing in real funding opportunities for the bank that being said we still have a very interesting opportunity to take the technology that nycb currently has thats going to improve with flagstar to make further improvements to start banking the mortgage business i think the mortgage business given the magnitude of our positioning could have a lot more deposits attached to it maybe lee if you want to add some color to the opportunity here on the mortgage side but this is really what we saw from day one that we could easily build that up and in addition to it the other lines of areas that were building up which includes governmentasaservice doing some technology deposit opportunities as well as going after the legacy nycb customers to ensure that we make loans with deposit maybe lee if you want to add some color on the deposit gathering opportunity on the mortgage side lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah i think to toms point and hes mentioned mortgageasaservice for months now i mean we have today about billion of escrow deposits from our service and subservicing book and nycb has at least a couple of billion of escrow deposits and so we can bring more of those deposits in from the people that were subservicing for not just the deposits attached to the loans that were servicing or subservicing but other escrow deposits that they have with other institutions i mean to toms point given the technology the new york community bank has that we havent had at flagstar theres an opportunity to go and raise core deposits from our tpo base and remember were dealing with about tpo correspondents brokers by having this sort of technology that allows them to do their business banking with new york community bank and i think thats a big opportunity and we can also take that technology to our warehouse customers as well which we havent done previously so i think we can go and bring more escrow deposits in as well as core deposits as a result of the enhanced technology new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah and like i indicated we are a major credit provider for some of these clients and when you get to the point where we are their primary credit facility we should have a shot out of all of the deposit opportunities that they typically utilize in the marketplace not a guarantee but clearly the more money you have on the table the more opportunity you have to really drive the relationship opportunity in addition to that thinking about the ci opportunity we have a long history here of not being in the market with boots on the ground on a standalone basis legacy nycb flagstar has made that transition the goal here on a combined basis is to have boots on the ground focused on ci midmarketsized companies and given that weve been in this business since the mid we have a shot of really catapulting our deposit growth initiative when it comes to boots on the ground on ci side so while our ci activity thats being done and flagstar is being integrated into nycb we have like i indicated on our opening commentary a lot of verticals here thats going to be deposit driven as we start focusing on the lending facilities were going to focus on deposit growth and deposit growth is going to be core value to our dna to improve the balance sheet metrics of this company david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc sounds good maybe one last quick one just back on your comment that youre upgrading systems what are some of the bigger systems that youre going to be upgrading over the indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah i would just indiscernible were growing into a complex platform with fiserv we have a dna platform they have architect well have a hybrid version of something very unique best opportunity as our core but whats interesting to that we also have a relationship with they have a relationship with salesforce on a business development opportunity indiscernible very powerful for the company i think thats very unique that we havent had here at nycb that we can utilize throughout the entire organization for example even the frontend system on loan process their frontend is very advanced more in line with the regional bank model they use ncino we dont have ncino so theres opportunities here that are significantly ramping up ourselves to a regional player when it comes to technology utilization at the same time were also giving flagstar on the commercial services side an opportunity to really upstart the treasury function the treasury capability of our correlations that we have in fiserv on commercial services which is its been very successful for us weve been really growing our core deposit base for our customers with the commercial services technology platform where five years ago it was not an offering and that has changed our ability to solidify the relationship lending on the deposit side so thats going to be i think a big win for the folks over at flagstar to utilize that technology so collectively theres a lot of moving parts here but like i said moving away from a traditional thrift model to more of a commercial regional model when it comes to the tech stack and theres probably other items that i cant disclose i could throw a couple of names out there but theres a lot of moving parts here dave thats going to really enhance the experience of the customer we got in the new flagstar new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right sounds good thanks guys i appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of brody preston with ubs please proceed with your questions brody preston q analyst ubs group ag hi good morning everyone thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning brody preston q analyst ubs group ag hey tom i just wanted to follow up on the expense commentary im sorry if i missed it but could you tell us what the cost savings are from the mortgage restructure and the timing of when those kind of work in to and then separately kind of whats a good run rate for operating expenses for the first quarter of the year thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so obviously the first quarter is going to be the highest quarter because its always the highest quarter of the year with payroll taxes and the like but we embarked upon the mortgage repositioning restructuring of that line at channel in late in january so well see that benefit going through towards the back end of q1 the number is significant as i indicated on our opening commentary were taking it down to around ftes where before at the high in that was so its a significant downsizing when it comes to a line of business that being said there is a benefit there on cost reduction at the same time we took into account the revenue offset of that as well right so youre taking out indiscernible balance sheet opportunity so you have to look at the revenue side and we also went into ill call it called shared services tie to embedded mortgages so all in that number is well over of million standalone but at the same time we also have our own cost structure that we have to focus on on a combined basis on just the synergies of the companies combining and that number is as indicated back when we announced the deal its about a million lee smith has done a phenomenal job over the past yearandahalf managing a very tough business hes always managed the business well but was a challenging year so theyve been cutting and cutting and cutting at the end of the day we looked at the business at the fourth quarter and wanted to make sure that this business is not losing any money so we think that at this stage of the game where we focus on mortgage were new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 at a position where have optionality to make a lot of money in the market changes but were not going to be losing money in the current environment thats important as we set the stage with the run rate and think about the concept i was explaining on the call is that we want to be in a position where our multiple is not tied solely to mortgage and our multiple is tied to a balanced revenue stream having this unique structure on mortgage traditionally consistent with a lot of the regional banks of our size and having an embedded nature in mortgage we have a great opportunity to look at the multiple as more of a commercial banklike multiple as we transition to a true commercial bank from a thrift model on the funding side so clearly we want to focus on multiple expansion we think this is one of the pieces to the puzzle to get there and we acted promptly right after the closing given the conditions in the marketplace so when it comes to cost structure i gave guidance of billion to billion we hope to be on the low end of that guide but clearly we think its a number thats achievable for us and the cost structure starts to see discernible adjustments starting in february i apologize for the long answer but theres a lot of moving parts here because you have to look at both mortgage revenue and mortgage expense maybe lee if you want to add some commentary lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc on the mortgage indiscernible this journey and this is your hard work and effort which we want to commend for the effort as well lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah thanks tom i mean its a significant restructuring there is going to be noise in the first quarter because were still running off the pipeline as it relates to the branches that were closing down were paying severance and then theres going to be some payments as we exit certain leases we will isolate that as a restructuring charge but there is going to be noise in the first quarter as a result of that from a cost point of view when i think itll be very clean will be april but having said that and as tom alluded to were going to start seeing benefits from what weve done as soon as february given we executed on this restructuring last thursday brody preston q analyst ubs group ag got it okay and tom maybe just one follow up on the expenses just given the conversion isnt happening until the first quarter i guess what percent of the million should we think about being more oriented versus thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc brody id say half but again weve done a lot of transactions in our lifetime we are going to we have hit the ground running hard we know what we have to do as far as integration this is typical when we look at transactions and theres an opportunity here on a standalone basis like i indicated we looked at the business new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 exmortgage when we announced the deal we looked at a run rate was probably like billion almost billion total cost structure i mean we tacked on about million exmortgage but mortgage has changed as i indicated lee has taken out a lot of cost in we think this is it this is where we feel very confident that were lean i think this is probably the lowest head count that flagstar has had in probably close to probably maybe eight or nine years now so i think were in a very good position to really capitalize a lot of investment in technology has been made by flagstar on the mortgage side that we can benefit here the servicing platform is substantial it is a great opportunity to think about costs selling some product on the servicing side indiscernible loan position as well as deposit gathering efforts so were in a good spot its a difficult decision when you have to make these types of significant restructuring efforts but at this stage of the game at that type of fte with this magnitude of the business and our presence we have an opportunity here to really drive revenue at the appropriate time if theres a resurgence in opportunity in the mortgage business brody preston q analyst ubs group ag got it and then maybe just switching over to the thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc just one other point brody preston q analyst ubs group ag yeah thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc the goal here was not to bleed we dont want to hemorrhage red as we come together and lee was challenged last year every quarter was a challenge when it comes to the changing interest rate environment indiscernible going through quarterly repositioning on ftes to the point where we looked at the business versus balance sheet versus not balance sheet utilization and we really want to go back to the traditional mortgage banking model where you used balance sheet very selectively and we are getting our gain on sale opportunity and we build a servicing portfolio as a revenue stream so we have a barbell strategy over time depending on market interest rates brody preston q analyst ubs group ag got it and then maybe if i could just switch to the deposit base real quick youve mentioned the forward curve a couple times in the call today tom so just i wanted to ask nearterm kind of where do you see your cost of interestbearing deposits or your deposit beta going as the fed kind of continues the hike early in the year and then pauses and then secondarily just given the back end of the forward curve is starting to head down how are you thinking about structuring your deposits from a maturity perspective from a indiscernible new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc im going to defer ill defer that question to john pinto our cfo john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so if we look at deposit betas the balance sheets really broken out into two different types right if youre looking at our deposits tied to either mortgageasaservice bankingasaservice some of the brokered business thats high beta its remained high beta since the beginning of the rate hike cycle and then if you look at the more retail the more stable piece from both legacy nycb and legacy flagstar they have been much much lower betas of course than that theyve started to tick up i think like just about everyone have seen other banks have seen over the last couple of quarters so well monitor that as well but when you look at where the curve is youd get to i think what tom is talking about a little bit earlier we do have a lot of flexibility in the borrowing base as well so well be able to look at both where our deposits are funded and how theyre funded as well as borrowings to ensure were ready for either of those positionings right either liability sensitive slightly liability sensitive or if we needed to move we could move that to asset sensitivity without too much difficulty with some shrinkage on the asset side so i think we have the opportunity to do both there and i think our deposit base like i mentioned is kind of split between whats in normal retail and what we have in the bankingasaservice business thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so brody this is tom just to follow up on that i made a very clear commentary probably about a yearanda half ago that if we go from zero to a much higher rate environment now well just reiterate the point zero to lets say i dont think youre hiding from people getting paid on excess liquidity so thats the marketplace so this is a phenomena in the financial services business right now that money is very expensive right now people want to get paid the reality is is that this company we have now is not going to be liability sensitive were going to be closer to neutral i think thats the gamechanger for us as we look at this combined business of flagstarnycb that were going to position ourselves to not be vulnerable to rates going up we want to take advantage of rates up and down as a business model and thats the uniqueness of the verticals the type of assets were going to have with our floating rate and having a better funding mix so i think thats really the benefit of the merger that were super excited about today and i think like i said when we put the banks together and were around liability sensitive without any repositioning or any assets and we think that we have a lot of liquidity if we want to tap liquidity at the appropriate time assuming market conditions warrant that so i think having optionality is good here and i think that the new flagstar is a much bigger balance sheet with a lot of great clients so we can service i call them the five star clients that were going to go after and bank them and go after the funding opportunity but our dna is going to focus on getting great deposits to fund this institution very differently than a traditional thrift model brody preston q analyst ubs group ag got it thank you very much everyone new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 operator thank you our next questions come from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning you noted the billion contribution from bankingasaservice product for government entities can you talk a little bit more about the growth opportunity there especially given that those are lower cost deposits thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so weve done a really solid job on partnering with our fintech providers and this has been a very good line of business for the bank as an alternative solution for funding the balance sheet this particular program in the fourth quarter was driven off the california inflation stimulus benefit that was out there we were the bank partner the bin provider along with a very large tech company that partnered into the money network card business that will dissipate but that was another program that we rolled up bear in mind weve also made mention that we are the us treasury bin provider for money network cards going forward and anything that the treasury does on the cards side so we have the opportunity to continue to build the business as well as other municipalities at the state level for a lot of the unemployment funds that we process under the money network card business so that business is going really well we have a bunch of onboarding happening in i will tell you that its hard to predict what quarter they come in so we dont really count them because they come in and theyre fairly large and whats interesting about this model is that not only did we ramp up the opportunity to work with our technology providers but we were also able to get our bankers into the municipal side of things and start the actual core deposit banking so some of these relations resulted in a pure deposit relationship either payroll for a state doing some operating activity for the state and its been meaningful in respect to the deposit opportunity this is something that we indiscernible top institutions in the country along with the top technology companies and its an rfp process and weve been very successful over the past yearandahalf but it does take time to onboard so i dont want to give any well call it aggressive vision of how much can come on but when they do come on it becomes meaningful so for example california was about a billion average balance and the cost of that was zero we have some other programs that are coming in this year depending on how quickly we ramp up us treasury that could be depending on what program is actually endorsed by the government and we would be then the company thats ready to go with issued cards at their will when theyre ready to make a decision on funding so its an interesting program its a good line of business its one of our three pillars of the bankingasaservice business that we carved out along with mortgage and tech and its been very successful it started out back during the pandemic and we were a very large balance sheet provider for stimulus payments and we were able new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 to hold some nice balances for a considerable period of time on the card side and we continue to leverage off of that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and can you just remind us of the seasonality within the bankingasaservice portfolio thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc theres obviously the three components the one thats very seasonal is obviously escrow payments when you have mortgages coming in and out you have tax payments but we think thats going to be something that we could really drive further deposit opportunity like i indicated in my previous commentary on the lee smiths business its tremendous opportunity to really be focused on managing the pi payments and the tax payments for our large customers that we do business with both on the warehouse side as well as on the servicing side and that number it goes up and down depending when the payments go back to the municipalities on the tax side but theres always the pi payments coming through and we have a long history under amtrust mortgage to manage that so i think we have a few billion dollars of preconsolidation with flagstar as we indicated i think it was at billion so its probably around billion now but i see a billion opportunity there just by the current client base as we go after it its very volatile in respect to interest rates theres a cost to that but as things start to normalize on the interest rates side we have an opportunity to have a different funding mechanisms versus nontraditional wholesale funding that the bank has been accustomed to so another source of opportunity and the ones that we have credit with i really feel the clients that we have credit with i feel that we could do a better job on banking that client and thats what were going to go after as we indicated the true operating activity that we could be helpful given our size and balance sheet and our technology offerings as well manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 steven how are you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good how are you tom i wanted to start on nim so i appreciate the guidance but tom what does it mean in the release here you say you expect margin above where you ended the year i would think that would be on a spot basis maybe consistent with guidance can you talk through that thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill give a broad discussion of funds john will go into the details well what we kind of indicated that we have one month of flagstar at the fourth quarter going into our current nim on a historical lookback basis for q4 and were in the low or is it john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so if you think about our guide for q1 at to we have the benefit of a lot more floating rate assets different verticals that applies to floating rate indices at the same time we have a significant amount of customers that are rolling into their option period so for example in q4 we had about billion of multifamily loans that went to sofr for plus or john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc coming off a coupon so thats adding to the benefit of repricing but when you think about the choices going forward absent the funding side on the asset side we really do have a unique opportunity to have a lot more assets repricing into the marketplace as well as a much more well call high yielding offering when it comes to the floating rate instrument and more of a focus to allow our customers to utilize derivatives to finance their longterms as an alternative solution than traditional fixed rate terms so weve been proactive on running out the capital markets activity that flagstar offers to their customers to some of our larger multifamily players that are doing larger transactions indiscernible structure for the balance sheet so we really do have an interesting series of choices on the verticals to really drive capital into businesses that are high yielding businesses that being said the funding is where you have still pressure obviously i indicated about a liability sensitivity as we closed the books at yearend but thats going to have a couple more rate hikes and obviously the forward curve has a pause for a while so were going to deal with that but ultimately we think we can move that to neutrality very quickly depending on where we want to position some of these assets new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 so i think we can have higher margins going back to my point were starting in the low were already in the mid as we start the year so its a different margin business given that we have new asset classes going into and with the focus of really building out more ci business as a hallmark for the company in addition to our legacy businesses which were going to support well have a lot more choices steven which will drive margin steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah do you think you can hold that because next quarter is going to be the first quarter where we have the new company right for the full quarter do you think you can hold nim in this range beyond the first quarter through the rest of the year thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre not going to get me to a point to give forward guidance in the margin thats a good try look we typically give q1 we give a threemonth outlook on margin i think the unique opportunity here is that we have a different balance sheet we have a different positioning we have unique asset classes and were still challenged as all banks are challenged on the funding side steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc if we could be successful in moving some of these wholesale liabilities into to core deposits then its a game changer for our multiple thats the strategy thats not going to be an overnight strategy weve done a lot of work over the past years but were starting the year very strong with a solid margin compared to a stand alone nycb with the benefits of a much higher average margin for the year knowing that were going to have probably an increase tomorrow and another increase in march which will hit all banks in respect to excess liquidity including nycb and we still have to contend with our liability funding on the wholesale side thats repricing and then it will stabilize steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc if i could followon indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc john if you want to add any color john maybe john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah the only other item and we mentioned it earlier on the governmentasaservice deposits right we had that program really kick off at the end of and then now we start to see really the utilization of those funds that were seeing that start to roll down as we would have expected in the first quarter and that is noninterest new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 bearing accounts so thats just another item for that well see thats beneficial in the first quarter that we lose a lot of that benefit when we go forward thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah i would add that internally when we look at the business even on the multifamily side going back to we had a high fee income opportunity and the actual yield on that asset class is much higher because of the propensity of prepayment we ended the year this year at the lowest level of prepayment activity compared to the financial crisis literally if you go back it was significantly lower than we had anticipated and we had a very strong year we had another record year in earnings but you get the multiple is what it is we were liability sensitive but if you think about where we ended up about million in total prepayment activity if you go back to that number was million so were up by over million and the portfolio is probably substantially larger than it is today than it was back in so theres tremendous opportunity to really get that coupon from a coupon to the markets and be very cognizant of the fee embedded in that structure to drive margin but we have a very conservative estimate in our forecast internally even though we dont go out the full year of how this asset class will react because the asset class is very stable right now there is no activity on prepay there is no large purchase transaction activity we think that will change once rates start to become more expected based on the borrowing base right now customers are not doing a whole lot so were kind of having a larger balance sheet with lower yields and as they reprice were getting a nice benefit on that particular core asset class steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it tom if i could also ask so if i look at the guidance the average loan growth of around for full year which doesnt make sense because you have flagstar for full year of whats the base that youre comparing that to thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc look were very conservative right now its early in the year last year we had loan growth on multifamily a lot of that was driven because market conditions have changed like i indicated were not going to have the activity until customers are comfortable on pulling down equity and buying and selling asset classes thats not happening in the marketplace today so youre going to have a larger asset class for longer but i think we have a conservative model that were going to be very focused on making sure we get the best economics given the market condition and steven as you know its expensive right now to finance shortterm so when you look at lets say a threeyear average life financing against a multifamily credit with a threeyear average life we need to get paid economically that number is around in the market off the fiveyear treasury and thats where were holding our line i think thats the right economics for us as we look at the lines of businesses so when you think about net loan growth thats reasonable and we always come out with a conservative estimate if it changes it changes but its early on and given that most customers are really kind of sitting on the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 sidelines trying to figure out what their funding needs are going to be in a very unique changing interest rate environment i think its reasonable warehouse could change dramatically john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc dramatically if these rates go down if for some reason were in a different rate environment towards the back end of this year we have billion warehouse book that has about billion outstanding that number could double very quickly so we have an opportunity at very high spreads along with some of the other lines of businesses so we really are being conservative and we want to be conservative so was a big year for us on a stand alone basis and if you take flagstars sofr investment portfolio out of the resi side they were relatively flat or down slightly for the year given the challenge in the mortgage business steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay so just to clarify youre assuming over full year average loans thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc its a early guide steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 hey good morning hey good morning everybody john just make sure im clear on the expenses the midpoint of your guide is pretty good to consensus call it million or million the amortization expense need a little help there it looks like it was million which would annualize about million is that about the right amortization expense for the year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah it is when you look at theres change in the interest rate environment not only did it have impacts on the purchase accounting adjustments for loans and securities but also of cdi i think originally we expected cdi to be at a much lower number when we announced the deal but its definitely changed given this interest rate environment so yeah when you look at that all intangible amortizations that million a month is a good run rate for thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah on the billion to billion that excludes amortization of cdi thats exclusive of amortization christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah it makes sense it looks like they offset each other in terms of the accretion john any whats the accretable yield that might be considered in the guide or how should we think about accretion income as a margin contributor john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so the way to think about it is we have benefits coming in from accretion from the loan in the securities side and that partially offsets some cds subdebt and the trust preferreds so youre looking probably on average in the million range i would say from an accretion perspective per month that well probably see the hard part about getting exact guidance on that is when you look at the flagstar loan portfolio especially even some of the securities portfolios that the floating rate pieces are marked pretty close to par if not really at par from an interest rate risk perspective some of the more fixed rate items has much deeper discounts so it really depends on the speeds that start to come in on those so were trying to be conservative as to the speed in which those discounts will come back to us but you could see some swings in that as payoffs come because youve got to recapture some of those pretty big discounts as you go forward thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah just to put my accounting hat on offsetting that in assuming most of the cds are short term then that discount then the premium will be gone and you have the possibility of higher accretion in the ph following year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah the cd market is yeah is definitely a little bit shorter than the security and the loan mark yeah new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but million will flow through the margin and thats included in the guidance correct john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats right christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then i just want to come back to steves question just to make sure im totally buttoned up the heldforsale loans were about billion i guess question one is that about plus or minus where we should think about held for sale and the guide for midsingle digit im looking at your average balance sheet is that off a billion base is that what youre using john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc the midsingle for the loan growth thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah no yeah its based off of the spot loan balance at thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible so were doing it at the to get back to the previous question as compared to the spottospot new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah as far as the loans held for sale maybe lee smith can give some color on the business since we got lee on the call lee lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah yeah no i think thats billion that you mentioned you can expect us to be in that zip code billion billion throughout obviously were in one of the toughest mortgage markets of the last years and so when we look at where activity is now i think that billion to billion is a good estimate for the remainder of for available for sale christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of peter winter with da davidson please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co great morning thanks good morning tom can you just give an update on the capital priorities going forward and maybe some thoughts on share buybacks thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start out with the first priority our dividend will continue at the current rate and thats been a priority historically and were very confident there obviously we had a substantial an accounting event at yearend markets have changed and we had to deal with that in respect to capital so we traded some of the book value benefits to earnings accretion going forward on the capital side that did have an impact that being said ill defer to john specifically on how were going to get that back and obviously where our capital stack currently sits but going back to my priority is were going to continue paying the current dividend rate for the combined shareholder base john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc historically the company has had a multifaceted capital plan when its a from payback to shareholders with dividends and years ago stock repurchases of course so first the use of capital as tom said is the dividend and second is for growth so any excess capital that we have after those two things we would absolutely look at down the road of potential buyback as market conditions dictate new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay thanks and then just real quick just on the billion office exposure just can you give a little bit more color on an update from a credit perspective on office john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah well both on office and really throughout ph this year the portfolio has been unbelievably strong from a credit perspective weve seen no transition into the 30day to 89day buckets or delinquency buckets really no real concerns even that have come out of the deferred loan process that we went through payments have been as we would have expected so weve really started to see a little bit of occupancy kick up there as well so the performance in that portfolio has been better than we originally expected coming out of the pandemic thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i would just add to johns comments strong sponsorship very low ltv very comfortable with the relationship longterm relationship lending tied to some of the multifamily investment as well so theres a lot of history there on the nycb standalone we picked up some commercial real estate from the flagstar folks as well non office indiscernible about billion john total is it total or less than billion john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so yeah total office is billion indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and again it goes back to the history as john indicated were not seeing any negative trends and the ltv is relatively low and in the event that we have to sit down and deal with a situation that has maybe some of credit deterioration we think were well protected as a sponsorship as well as overall value i havent seen any negative trends peter its been very very solid peter j winter q analyst da davidson co and when those loans come up for refinance can you just maybe updated ltvs or debt service coverage ratios when they come up for refinance from an office thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc it looks like i think we have about billion we have about billion thats coming up in total cre thats not office new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc its not just office thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ph and that cut out to coupon that coupon is probably closer to sevenandchange now and then next year in is about another billion so we dont have a ton of money it looks like its of the cre book over the next two years coming due and next year i think its a to coupon so again we think we have a rate potential on repricing them but when you look at the average ltv im not sure if you have that on you john its a pretty low average ltv john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah on average ltv john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc on office thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc on office and i think we feel pretty confident that again we havent seen at all any deterioration as john indicated the 30day bucket the delinquency buckets are zero john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc zero thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc we feel pretty good about that and given the current environment but in the event we even during the pandemic we had a handful of customers that were thinking about maybe having issues and we gave them some balance sheet we gave them some relief and ultimately we got them through the other side and in the event there was any maneuverability on their end were very comfortable in exiting the asset class and theres plenty of investors that will look at these assets as well call them unique new york city assets that will be well owned would love to be owned by investors that are comfortable on taking the keys from the bank if necessary we havent had to have that problem so far but in the event we do we have low leverage and we have strong sponsorships so hopefully the sponsors stay strong and if they have to kick in some more equity to keep them going thats the expectation new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 peter j winter q analyst da davidson co and theyve been willing to kick in the equity if needed thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc we havent had to have those conversations yet but were very focused on conservative underwriting and thats how we look at our book we dont have a huge portfolio relevant to the total balance sheet but what indiscernible relationshipsponsorship type transactions that were very comfortable that historically in the past we have seen customers write checks weve had a handful over the past six to nine months and these are very large families that are comfortable on keeping their coveted asset classes in their familys business peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks tom congratulations on closing this deal thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you peter its been a journey but were looking to the future and were super excited operator thank you our next questions come from the line of matthew breese with stephens please proceed with your questions matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning matt morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc just to clarify the million a month of accretable yield is that just for the first quarter of im assuming the fourth quarter this year the first quarter and if its not could you give us some sense for the cadence of accretable yield in usually its pretty frontend loaded i just want to get a sense for the cadence there john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean it can be frontend loaded no doubt but thats the average thats what i would assume for you will have like i said when you have some big discounts and you do have some payoffs you can have some spikes here and there but no i dont expect it to be dramatically different than that in thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call

right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then just on the core nim components could you give us the yearend spot rate on interestbearing deposits and then what are incremental multifamily and commercial real estate yields coming on it today thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill go to the yield so matt were looking at like i indicated were pushing towards 225ish with the five year trying to hover around on a traditional fiveyear deal commercial is probably another bps above that were not really doing any longterm financing and if we do longterm financing were really pushing our capital markets group to sit down with the customer and structure something synthetically which does change the economics for the bank as well as for the customer so were giving them more choices i indicated a lot of our customers that arent doing a whole lot they have an option and the option was a very expensive option we gave them a third option which is a sofr option which is off of sofr and sofr has been rising so its not as attractive as it was six months ago but its an alternative and were seeing probably half of our customers on the multifamily side opt into that choice which we like that for interest rate risk balance sheet management perspective but a much higher coupon i think i indicated the commercial side was repricing but in we have about another billion around on the multi side and if you take in over the next two years its about billion on multi with like a coupon and market yields are around assuming they all go into a fiveyear structure not doing a whole lot of 7year 10year were reluctant to do that as we look at the marketplace and in general i think people are sitting on the sidelines right now so were getting the benefit of repricing just from the optionality of them making a choice and in very rare circumstances youre seeing property transactions so we could have a higher balance for longer because theres less activity as indicated in my previous comment theres very little economics in our internal forecasts for prepayment activity i think we had probably one of our worst years last year we still had strong it was a record year on earnings we had million of prepay going back to the high at about million in previous years going back to new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 so we have the opportunity here for great economics if the marketplace changes but were assuming that its going to be relatively benign so were not even in our first quarter guide we said that prepayments are not going to be impactful in any meaningful way going forward in this current rate environment matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great i appreciate that and then on the spot rate on interestbearing deposits at yearend quarterend john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah at yearend the spot rate on interestbearing deposits is thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc matt just one point so i want to talk about some of the other lines of business i mean we have a great builder finance business that number is close to bps spread off of repricing off of sofr indices we have fees involved in those types of businesses we have the warehouse business at a substantial spread in the 200basis point spread we look at that as a great opportunity because we know that business very well were very comfortable with that business clearly a very attractive yielding business and we have other ci businesses that are part of the legacy flagstar coming over that we think were going to grow very nicely on a combined basis those spreads are very high theyre not near what we are typically accustomed to theyre floating rate they have fees they have structure behind them and they very good incremental benefits to the margin which is going to be a capital deployment opportunity in and beyond that is the gamechanger that were putting together here so were not just that one bank that does one thing so we have many many verticals with different opportunity and were im going to be very cautious given the rate environment to deploy capital to ensure we have the best capital allocation story to talk about as we build the new flagstar matthew breese q analyst stephens inc no understood tom i appreciate all that i did want to also touch on the governmentasaservice deposits just consider it comes in in lumps and then it sounds like as its spent it winds down could you give us a sense for the pace of attrition on the governmentasa service deposits and is it expected to roll off to a near zero towards the end of the year or is it something that holds a residual balance and can grow off of that residual yearover year thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so im going to start and im going to defer to john hes done a lot of work around expectation and modeling and doing regression analysis on how this would react and we actually have experience with the stimulus payments and how long theyve held on balance sheet more than we expected so we conservatively model it which is in our model so we had a large benefit in the fourth quarter that came from the california stimulus opportunity that we were the bin provider for its holding better than expected probably it will be there for longer than expected but we model it conservatively new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 ultimately that will go down to a tail to a point and john can get into some details on the tail at the same time we have other ones ramping up in although not the same type of program theyll be consistent with unemployment programs that we manage we have a larger relationship with jersey and others we just picked up a big win recently with california which will be a substantial benefit for the bank once it gets geared up again its the timing of it matt it could happen in q2 q3 it really is as quick as government gets it up and running and were ready to react but its been a good business for us and theres some fees involved but more importantly the average cost of those liabilities are very low indiscernible zero in most cases and john if you want to talk about some of the trends john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah weve tried to model it weve been pretty close to the modeling we saw with the economic impact stimulus payments so there is a tail that will sit around but the bulk of the deposits do go pretty quickly and then you have like a slow draw after that so yeah we will have deposits i would assume is the end of the year i dont think its going to be that material of a number by then but the first quarter will still have a really nice average balance then will start to come down from there matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay understood and then what are the remaining onetime costs from the deal and the mortgage restructuring and then could you give us a sense for timing throughout the year when theyll be taken thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc let lee talk about the mortgage restructuring john will get into some guesstimates on what we think were going we have left go ahead lee lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bank fsb yeah sure so the costs with the restructuring that weve just ph factioned we estimate to be million to million and that is predominantly severance but as i mentioned earlier there are some leases that we need to get out of so theres some costs associated with that theres a couple of contracts that we are also going to exit were going to isolate that as a restructuring charge and we will take that in the first quarter in addition we probably need days thats what were estimating to work off the pipeline those loans that are locked that are not yet closed of those offices that weve closed down so thatll take us through the end of march and thats why earlier i mentioned that even though youre going to start seeing cost savings starting in february there is noise as a result of the onetime restructuring charge the runoff of the pipeline and i expect us to have a real clean run rate beginning april john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and then on the mergerrelated charges well see some in the next couple of quarters when it comes to primarily severance and just some consulting work to get through the consolidation of the two companies so youll see new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 that as well in the coming quarters and then therell be some charges when we get to q1 of when we get to the conversion date matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay last one for is just overall capital levels tangible equity at your total riskbased capital ratio is sub12 should we be contemplating any sort of common equity raise or sub debt raise to bolster these ratios thats all i had thank you john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah thanks matt i think given where the capital ratios are and just given the credit nature of the two balance sheet the two legacy banks balance sheet and the limited risk really from a chargeoff and a provisioning perspective were comfortable where the capital ratios are with a common equity tier ratio over thats a good spot for us to be given the loss content in those portfolios so its something were going to of course continue to manage and we believe the best use of the capital right now is primarily dividends then of course to fund growth and then going forward we can look at other capital initiatives depending on market conditions operator thank you our next questions come from the line of christopher marinac with janney please proceed with your questions christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey tom and john thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc i had a similar question as matt on the capital so would the likely grow from here or is there a scenario where it may dip a little bit as the balance sheet is considered quartertoquarter thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i think it would grow indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean the goal is to grow i mean it depends a little bit one of the things we look at when we put both companies together is theres a large portion of the assets that even though they have really low loss content in them including multifamily mortgage warehouse theyre riskweighted assets so we do have that that we have to kind of work through from a capital perspective but the goal is over time to ensure our capital ratios are where we want them to be in our capital target so thats no doubt the plan new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and obviously were planning strong earnings growth as well to increase our capital position christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and last question thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc just to be clear with that weve traded off capital for accretion on the adjustment given the changes in interest rates so youre getting a lot of as john indicated benefit as far as the marks on the assets and liabilities so that does have an impact to get that back over time so we think youll see some nice earnings per share growth as well christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and then last question john just has to do with how the bankingasaservice and governmentasa service reprices over time do you have to have an absolute fed cut before you can lower those rates thinking out just a couple of quarters from now john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc the governmentasaservice deposits are primarily noninterestbearing or if they are theyre really specific exactly what those costs would be on bankingasaservice deposits to see big cuts youd probably have to see big drops in those rates you probably have to see some fed cuts especially in this environment but times change and sooner or later the spreads can narrow a little bit on what youre paying for a lot of those products but i think wed have to start to see a fed pivot before we start to see some significant savings there christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and are those bankingasaservice indiscernible maybe threequarters or twothirds if the fed moves is that about right john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean there are range some are beta and some are in that range so on the bankingasa service side its a range of whats tied to the change christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it great thanks for taking all my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ebrahim youre back ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey im back im so sorry i know its been a long call just one question tom i think you mentioned multiple times around becoming a commercial bank multiple expansion for the stock give us a sense of what you think this combined franchise as we look beyond system conversion next year like if you have any sense of where you think the bank is from a rotc roa perspective what the franchise should be earning in a steady state environment thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well look i mean this is obviously going to be a block and tackle year were super excited about putting these companies together the rebranding effort thats going to take place we are transitioning to some great technology thats going to really assist our customer base as we move towards commercial banking weve got to work a lot on the funding side and the company is going to be historically over the past couple of years were earning just under tce we should be in the highteens and i think the reality in the highteens on a traditional multiple perspective with return on assets well north of 120ish over time its going to take some work here but the reality is that the balance sheet has changed dramatically if you think about the lines of businesses that were going to have the verticals that well reprice very different than historical fixed rate lender that had vulnerabilities to rising interest rates so we want to be better balanced at the same time were going to get our cost structure right we have work to do going back to as a block and tackle year and we look at and hopefully a different rate environment well be able to take advantage of a better funding mix were going to go after the deposit funding if we move that positioning to having better funding as a core competency of our number one priority that will change multiple we feel very strongly that mortgage on a percentage basis because the bank is much larger will be less of a concentration on total income stream so we want to have less dependency on mortgage less dependency in wholesale finance and we believe that will give us a better blended multiple and multiple expansion is going to be key as we look at the transformation to a commercial bank we have all the plots in place its going to take time to block and tackle but we have the road map and the system conversion will be done in the first quarter at the same time were going to be rolling out the verticals proving to the marketplace that were allocating capital to different lines of businesses that have better margin businesses new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2023 and now at the point as a company were looking at loanbyloan detail on a total return basis and will allocate capital accordingly and thats something very different when you have choice now we have choice on a combined basis where historically we had limited choices when we had our business model so were excited about the business model we think we have a great story to tell this has been a long time in the waiting a lot of planning and were super excited about launching out the new flagstar or the new brand ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator thank you that is all the time we have for our questionandanswer session i
