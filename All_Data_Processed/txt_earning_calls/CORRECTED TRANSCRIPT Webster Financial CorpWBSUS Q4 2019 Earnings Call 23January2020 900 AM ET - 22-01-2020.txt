corp thanks terry good morning everyone thank you for joining websters fourth quarter earnings call cfo glenn macinnes and i will review business and financial performance for the quarter hsa bank president chad wilkins is here with us in waterbury and will be available during qa ill begin my comments on slide websters fourth quarter results demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong execution on our strategic priorities earnings per share were in q4 this compares to in both q3 and q4 of when each period is adjusted for onetime items the decline resulted from a reduced level of net interest income relative to each prior period primarily driven by the full impact of three fed interest cut rates during the second half of a lowerthanexpected libor rate in q4 and a mix shift in the loan portfolio to lower yielding highquality cre loans assuming no further fed action in our net interest income is expected to grow beginning in q1 and continuing throughout the year we anticipate full year net interest income will meet or exceed the million generated in based upon our current asset growth forecast all other metrics in the quarter were favorable loan growth was strong as commercial loans grew from a year ago or by more than billion total footings at hsa bank increased from a year ago for growth of almost billion during the year disciplined expense control resulted in flat linked quarter noninterest expense and credit metrics remained remarkably strong contributing to our lowest quarterly provision in more than seven years in q4 nonperforming loans net chargeoffs and classified assets were all lower as a percentage of total loans when compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year the overall portfolio weighted average risk rating improved as well tangible book value now exceeds billion and increased from the end of tangible book value per share is also higher than last year glenn will dive deeper into the quarter but id like to make a few comments related to full year performance im on slide reported ppnr totaled almost million and increased from this was driven by positive operating leverage as revenue grew more than while expenses increased only despite the lower interest rate environment in the second half of the year the net interest margin for full year was compared to in the efficiency ratio for the full year improved one full point to and the provision totaled million and was at its lowest annual level since our performance resulted in a full year return on common equity of and a return on tangible common equity of the net result was full year eps of up from this represents our 10th consecutive full year of eps growth which puts us in select company within the banking industry also full year common dividend of per share increased from slide highlights the strength of our loan and deposit performance since the end of a little over billion of loan growth has been accompanied by more than billion of deposit growth our loan to deposit ratio of continues to provide us with significant flexibility we believe that our ability to consistently generate organic loan and deposit growth yearin and yearout is a differentiator our fiveyear loan and deposit growth cagrs were both around turning to slide ill comment briefly on our lines of business commercial bankings loan portfolio has increased more than billion over the past year for end of period growth of and deposits were also up in that business line hsa bank opened new accounts in representing its third consecutive year with webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 production above accounts community bankings loans and deposits each grew by approximately from a year ago with continued strength in business banking and mortgage banking ill now turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john ill begin on our average balance sheet on slide average loans grew million or linked quarter growth continues to be led by the commercial business in the quarter we had significant growth in commercial real estate which increased million versus the third quarter and more than million from a year ago commercial loans now represent of total loans compared to in prior year consumer loan performance was led by growth in residential mortgages with some offset from continued reduction in home equity versus prior year our billion of total loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth combined low cost transactional and hsa deposits have increased more than billion from last year and now represent of total deposits their combined cost was basis points in q4 and basis points in prior year the q1 seasonal inflow of hsa and public funds deposits will fund loan growth and reduce shortterm borrowings slide summarizes our q4 income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings net interest income was million lower than prior quarter this was primarily due to a basis point reduction in average onemonth libor contributing to a reduction in interest income of million this was partially offset by lower deposit cost of million reflecting a reduction of basis points and we also realized the benefit of million from loan and security balanced growth likewise net interest margin was basis points lower than q3 the drop in loan yields reduced nim by basis points which was primarily driven by lower libor rates growth in loan and securities also compressed nim another basis points this was partially offset by basis points due to reduction in rate on deposits and borrowings net interest income in q4 was about million lower than our outlook and nim was about basis points lower this was primarily the result of lower deferred fees from prepayments the timing on deposit rate reductions which came in basis points higher than our forecast and the mix shift from ci to commercial real estate and lower than expected libor rates versus prior year net interest income declined million million of the decline was due to lower rates with a partial offset of million from additional volume asset sensitivity has been reduced over the past year under a short end down basis points scenario our ppnr would be lower by this compares to at the end of q3 and a year ago noninterest income increased million linked quarter and decreased million from prior year the linked quarter increase primarily reflects a higher level of revenue from client hedging activities the decrease from q4 of reflects a million gain on the sale of banking centers in that period reported noninterest expense of a little under million was flat linked quarter and up million yearoveryear preprovision net revenue of million declined million from q3 and million from prior year loan loss provision for the quarter was million and essentially matched net chargeoffs the efficiency ratio was the increase from q3 and a year ago were driven by lower net interest income and partially offset by continued expense discipline our effective tax rate was up from in q3 the increase was due to a discrete tax expense associated with the state and local tax position recognized in q4 webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 beginning with slide ill highlight the line of business results commercial banking loan growth was led by investor commercial real estate which grew linked quarter and versus prior year ci balances were flat linked quarter with fundings offset by payoffs but grew versus prior year net interest income grew million from last year primarily reflecting average loan growth of million or this was partially offset by lower loan spreads driven by mix and a lower credit on deposits noninterest income and noninterest expense were essentially flat from prior year combined ongoing loan growth resulted in a increase in ppnr versus prior year slide highlights hsa bank which delivered a solid quarter led by the production of new accounts our million accounts have billion of total footings footings were billion or higher than prior year while accounts were higher net interest income was higher from prior year reflecting growth of in average deposits and the impact of our lower net credit rate the cost of deposits was basis points and has remained flat for quarters noninterest income increased from prior year driven by an increase in interchange revenue and flat account fees primarily due to a reduction in statement fees as we move the account holders to estatements total revenue for the quarter grew from a year ago while expenses increased resulting in flat pretax net revenue january monthtodate deposits are up approximately million from year end with new accounts tracking to last years levels slide highlights community banking total loans grew by over yearoveryear with growth coming equally from business banking and personal banking business and consumer deposits grew and resulting in overall deposit growth of nearly from prior year net interest income was adversely impacted by the declining rate environment adjusting for a million onetime gain on the sale of six banking centers in the fourth quarter of noninterest income increased yearoveryear led by higher mortgage banking revenue expenses grew by less than as investments in technology and people were offset by efficiencies in other areas side highlights our key asset quality metrics nonperforming loans in the upper left declined million from q3 assetbased lending represented million of the decrease net chargeoffs in the upper right declined million from q3 and totaled million in the quarter commercial classified loans in the lower left decreased modestly and now represent basis points of total commercial loans this compares to a 20quarter average of basis points our allowance for loan loss remained at million with the provision of million and a coverage ratio of basis points the million provision reflects the strong credit profile which john outlined were on track with our cecl adoption which will be recorded on our balance sheet effective january we expect the day one impact to increase our current allowance by approximately in line with the range disclosed last quarter the impact will be recorded as a charge to capital and will reduce common equity tier capital between and basis points but increase total riskbased capital by about basis points regarding the day two impact our quarterly cecl allowance will be based on loan growth and mix asset quality and the macroeconomic environment given stable metrics wed expect our allowance coverage ratio to remain around basis points higher than q4s level slide provides our outlook for q1 compared to q4 we expect average loans to increase to driven primarily by commercial real estate and residential loans we expect average interestearning assets to grow around we expect net interest margin to increase up to basis points assuming stable market rates as a result we expect net interest income to increase million to million noninterest income is likely to increase million to million we expect our efficiency ratio to be in the range of and our provision for loan and lease loss under cecl will be driven by loan composition and forecasted economic conditions we expect the tax rate on a nonfte basis to be approximately to and lastly excluding any share buybacks we expect our average diluted share count to be approximately million shares webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 with that ill turn things back over to john john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks glenn webster enters this new decade and our 85th year from a position of strength based on our efforts and accomplishments in the decade just ended we will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities always with a longterm view of maximizing economic profits and continuing to build franchise value were fortunate to be guided in our strategic direction by an accomplished board of directors im pleased to cite four of websters board members liz flynn carol hayles karen osar and lauren states for their recent recognition among women incs most influential corporate board directors as always id like to acknowledge our valuesbased bankers for their outstanding contributions and their unwavering commitment to our customers our communities and to each other and finally before we open it up for questions id like to take a minute to comment on the announcement we made this morning that consistent with our wellplanned multiyear transition jim smith had announced that he will be retiring from websters board of directors effective at our april annual shareholders meeting at which time i will become chairman of the board on behalf of our board of directors and all webster bankers id like to again acknowledge and thank jim for his incredible contributions to webster and the communities we serve over his distinguished 44year career id also like to thank him personally for his guidance support and friendship during my time at webster and particularly during the period of transition he is truly a remarkable person with that michelle im happy to open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to start first looking at the guidance on nim the up to basis points in is a very favorable trend for glenn what are you seeing that leads you to think nim will expand in the first quarter glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 so part of that steve is the inflow of both hsa and public funds which will allow us to pay down some fhlb borrowings so thatll help nim and then we also have cd maturities and promotional savings repricing which will also be favorable both net interest income and nim steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then once we get beyond the first quarter glenn how are you thinking about nim for the rest of glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so its sort of flattish for the next couple quarters steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you and then thank you for chad on hsa bank can you talk about how the enrollment season went for hsa and how youre feeling about account and deposit growth based on what you saw john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes steve its john and ill let chad obviously provide some color obviously we say the same thing at this time of the year which is its too early to make a firm call but the guidance well provide is kind of todate in january were tracking really almost on top of the ranges we had last year both in inflow of deposits and new account openings so if you think of those numbers thats about million in new deposits and in the ballpark of accounts so were tracking kind of where we were last year and obviously well be able to give you a much better indication at the next earnings call when the enrollment period wraps charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah the only thing id add john is that we continue to see the strongest performance in the channels where we have the most influence on growth activities and were going to have the indiscernible study coming out between now and the end of the first quarter and well have full results to report on when we get there as well john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and one comment ill make steve maybe to anticipate other questions on the call too there was no impact in q4 of any of the account movements that we talked about in q3 so we didnt receive any compensation from some of those accounts leaving and none of those accounts left during the quarter so fourth quarter was not impacted by the information we guided the group to in q3 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then thank you and then the final question so if we look at full year loan and deposit growth for they were each running above the twoyear cagr do you think that you can continue pacing above that historical cagr in thanks webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp so you may have noticed i said in the beginning of my remarks which was an important point i wanted to make that i thought we would meet or exceed our total net interest income for the year based on our current asset growth forecast and i think thats a great question right now our loan growth forecast is slightly below what we did between and so i think were relatively confident we can keep running at that relative pace maybe slightly below on loans and when you factor in growth in the securities portfolio we dont think that our asset growth metrics or aspirations are too aggressive steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks before i sign off john congratulations on the chairman role and best of luck to jim smith in retirement thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of collyn gilbert with kbw please proceed with your question collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone my first question just is around the growth that you saw this quarter and how you guys are sort of seeing that trend in because obviously as you guys indicated the mix this quarter of higher cre versus ci impacted the nim so number one just where did the extraordinary growth from cre come from and then maybe just some commentary on as how you see that playing out in and then also maybe just some of the dynamics within ci as to why that growth didnt necessarily materialize perhaps to what you were thinking john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure happy to do that collyn and thanks for the question yeah its an interesting underlying story i always talk about the fact that weve got these great this diverse source of loan growth right both geographically in product set and in business line and i wish i could say that we could just simply pull levers and have growth in certain areas and so i think this quarter just happened to be a quarter of light payoffs in commercial real estate ill provide some detail on that because i think its also important to know that were not sort of being too aggressive in any one area we had extraordinary growth in our investor commercial cre book but that was on about million in new fundings that compares to million in new fundings fourth quarter of last year so really our origination levels were not materially higher the difference in the story in cre was we had million in payoffs this q4 as opposed to million in payoffs the year before there doesnt seem to be a trend line or any dynamics that are driving that but i think its an important point to make that we didnt have outsized cre originations we had significantly lower cre payoffs webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 and the story is similar in ci in sponsor and specialty business for instance which you know has been a big driver of highyielding loan growth for us we had originations of something like million in q4 as opposed to around million last q4 but we had million almost million in payoffs in that sponsor and specialty business resulting in an actual decline in the second half of the year so its really a payoff story more than outsized originations and as you heard me talk about the net result is a slightly lower yield on the loans and a slight improvement in weighted average risk rating and credit quality in the portfolio so i think youll see more of that going forward youll see a different mix in different quarters just depending on with our i think disciplined credit choices where we have opportunities across our footprint collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay do you have a sense of or maybe as you within the guidance that youre offering what you think pay downs will do this year i mean do you think theyll slow john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp we dont i think if you looked at our expectations again and its hard to predict in the various categories i think we anticipate similar origination volumes and similar paydown metrics obviously that could change quarter to quarter but if we look back over history if you look at it on kind of a trailing fourquarter basis you get a pretty good sense so the short answer to your question is we are not anticipating some sort of macro change that would either lower prepays or drive them higher collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful thank you and then glenn just on the comment on the timing on pushing through some of these lower deposit costs in the first quarter yeah just curious kind of where your head is and how youre pricing some of your cd rates now and just how aggressive you think you could be on some of those assuming i know all your guidance assumes no more fed cuts so just kind of getting a sense of where you think ultimately some of those deposit costs can go glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so if i look at total deposit costs for q4 i think were somewhere around basis points we think on average in the first quarter that could drop down to basis points and a lot of that is like i indicated shortening the term of cds which also helps our asset sensitivity but its also pointing back on some of the promotional rights that we have out there collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp just sort of for context our sevenmonth cds at ph and we have a savings promotion thats out there at right now webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right thank you for that and then chad a question for you an obvious question that maybe you dont necessary want to hear but so when we talk about hsa and john youd indicated that kind of youre tracking similar to where you guys tracked in i guess the simple question is why is growth not higher given all that youve done all the investments youve made within the sales force and infrastructure just curious as to why growth isnt coming on higher charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah collyn in we actually saw higher growth rates in our new accounts with new employers so a little bit lower with our existing employers and as you know a large portion of our new accounts come from existing employers so its really was enrollment based and there is a lot of factors that impact enrollments in health plans and consequently in hsas i do believe we have the opportunity to influence that to a greater extent as we go into weve conducted a lot of pilots and programs in that were targeted at providing decision support tools and programs to our employers which showed really positive results in terms of both penetration and deposit rates with customers so were looking to accelerate that as we go into but again a lot depends on the macro environment and how that influences enrollments as well collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right thank you i will leave it there thanks guys charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp thanks collyn john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks collyn operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please proceed with your question mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning and let me echo whats already been said of congratulating both john and jim on their new roles john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks its good to hear from you mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 first question im curious john could you give us a little update on sort of how things are going in boston and also help us maybe size your business these days in philadelphia and dc markets john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah sure boston continues to track weve made no secret that its probably the most competitive market we have with respect to cost of customer acquisition and deposit pricing and that really hasnt abated much and youve all read that jpmorgan is there as well which continues to make the market competitive we continue to make progress i think were on track to hit our goal in terms of asset growth in loans and deposits and again its been probably more costly than the rest of our footprint we are path breakeven for a year now i think we had about in just retail bank contribution there which we try and track to be honest with ourselves and honest with you obviously our profitability in the market overall market is pretty strong because thats really the epicenter of our sponsor in specialty business a lot of our sponsor relationships weve got a great commercial real estate book there a couple of billion dollars in loan so were happy with where the market is we continually need to reduce square footage our banking centers they are big and they dont need to be that big so were making some progress on that front but all in all we think its a critical market its a fast growing market there are more cranes in the sky in that city than you could imagine and so we do think that our physical presence there and our retail presence there helps our wealth management and all of our commercial banking so i would say good not overperforming and not underperforming kind of right on our expectations with respect to the other markets mark in obviously growing any retail footprint in those other markets in philadelphia or in dc weve got good traction weve been in the philadelphia market from a commercial real estate perspective for over years now weve had a lot of growth in that market our total loans in philadelphia in the south jersey philadelphia pennsylvania area approached billion excellent asset quality full relationships with middle market customers the vast majority of those outstandings are commercial real estate and we have abl there so again youve heard our philosophy we dont look at it as a loan production office we look at it as a core market we expect cash management and other relationships with our borrowers there and were okay with growing at a modest pace because we dont want to be the lender of last resort and id say dc which is not as critical to us right now weve got asset based lending in commercial real estate but were talking a couple of hundred million dollars in exposure there and it hasnt been really a significant growth market for us recently mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly john the market seems to be enamored of moes these days i guess im curious are there banks out there that you could see a combination with it would make sense to you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp you want me to give you the specific names mark no mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co sure webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no look obviously there is a lot more chatter and there are some compelling reasons i think why banks are choosing to gain scale we think gaining scale over time is important we really havent shifted our focus or made a significant pivot in that regard obviously as i said there is a lot more discussions ceos are talking with each other there are compelling reasons both from a technology investment perspective higher capital scale access to data all the reasons why its better we were three times the size weve probably spent the same amount on aml bsa as we do now so i understand the compelling rationale we would never say never but we are very much focused on continuing to grow and exploit our differentiated capabilities but ill leave it at that to say were not focused on ma as a primary strategic goal right now but we would never say never mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush securities please proceed with your question david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a couple of questions for you so first on expenses i was just curious is there anything on the expense front you could do to offset some of the recent nim pressure as we look to and the reason i ask it looks like based on the efficiency guidance of looks like some of the operating leverage could reverse a little bit john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp david great question ill let glenn provide some fuller context and i think its the appropriate question to ask i think weve demonstrated to the market over a sustained period of time that we have good expense discipline and expense control we have not been aspirational about really aggressively reducing expenses because weve talked about how important it is to continue to invest in our organic growth in our differentiated businesses particularly in commercial and hsa and weve done that and i think it will stead us well over the long term the short answer is yes we have opportunities and were working on many of them right now business process automation in the middle and back office weve got a lot of things rolling there we have fewer people in operations this year than we did last year and will continue that trend so we think we can really start to bend the curve with the use of technology automation middle office efficiency and so yes we do have tools available to us and not all of that is layered in our forward forecast we want to make sure that were not hurting our organic growth and our longterm franchise build but we do have levers to pull with respect to expense control glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah no i would just so you have to keep in mind the first quarter has a couple things you have the higher fico costs which somewhat offset some of the medical costs and theres some ins and outs there dave but to johns point i think we have opportunity both in the middle and back office as well as optimizing as we continue to do the community bank webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks for that and then shifting to the nii and some of the nim commentary well on the leverage strategy that you guys kind of spoke about last quarter where you had purchased i think it was about million of securities funded by fhlb borrowings do you plan to unwind that with the deposit inflows in the first quarter or conversely do you plan to add to that leverage strategy glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no so i can tell were likely not unwinding it and that if you look at our earning asset growth in johns earlier comments you have both loan growth and proportionate security growth david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great and then the last one for john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp indiscernible david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc yes glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp go ahead john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no im sorry david go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc so then just continuing with the discussion on nim so your interest rate sensitivity you mentioned about how it was reduced this quarter how low would you like to take that interest rate sensitivity glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so wed like to move closer to neutral i think the only caveat to that is we want to preserve some of the upside as well so i think if you look in our slide deck back on page you can see the progress weve made particularly in the short end down scenario on the falling rate scenario you can see the progress so part of adding investment securities part of the balance sheet positioning we did in the second and third quarter certainly helped that also the fact that we have absorbed three fed cuts as well and if you look out at least as far as were looking at more stability in both fed funds onemonth libor and threemonth libor which will sort of keep that sort of webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 constant and then actions we take on top of that whether its adding more fixed rate assets in the form of residential or equipment finance investment securities portfolio or shortening as we have our borrowings and some of the cd promotions and things like that will have a positive impact going forward david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just also wanted to give my congratulations to you john and jim for a great career and as a connecticut resident i certainly hope jim stays fully engaged in the opportunities to help improve the financial situation and fiscal situation here in the state john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp jared thanks for that comment and i think i can even though jims not here i can tell you and rest assured that he will continue to be involved in policy around the state jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great to hear maybe just circling back on the hsa and chad or john any of the have you noticed any of the rhetoric around the political environment right now in medicare for all impacting any of the employers decisions to adopt a high deductible healthcare plan or is that really not flowing into their sort of internal hr discussions at this point john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp its interesting so some of what ill tell you is speculation and other is obviously what we know i think on a macro level obviously the chances of full medicare for all single payer seem to have gone down with changes in the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 various polls and that rhetoric seems to have gone away a little bit and we think as weve said weve always been confident that given our current healthcare system that that wasnt a real risk in the short term there has been more discussion in various state capitals around high deductible health plans and so on and so forth we actually dont think that that is the dialog that could be driving maybe lower adaptability as weve said all along we think that there is a bit of a compression across the industry based on a or unemployment rate where when companies are having to be more and more aggressive in competing for talent that they are optically trying to provide richer more fuller benefits and that that may have slowed the whole industry down over the last couple of years as youve seen we are not seeing and ill let chad put a finer point on it sort of a dialog around the virtuous nature or lack thereof of high deductible health plans actually impacting employers decisions not to offer them or encourage their employers to adopt them charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah i totally agree john that was spot on jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks and then capital management i hear what you said around ma and focusing organically but when you look at capital you continue to build it here it looks like thats going to continue as we go forward outside of ma should we expect to see webster be more active in trying to either through the dividend or through a buyback again return more capital john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah good question ill be really transparent here again so obviously our primary desire is to use capital to grow the balance sheet to support abovemarket loan growth to look to try and make some key investments or acquisitions in the hsa space or portfolios or people in commercial banking as we continue to expand those and weve obviously been working diligently in those areas and looking at opportunities absent that you saw in the third quarter we had an increase in our authorization to million for a stock repurchase so that if those internal strategic things dont work well then look at other capital actions either another increase in the dividend we had a significant increase in the dividend and if none of those are available to us i think what youll see is us being more likely to buy back shares over the next couple quarters jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah its great color thanks and then just finally for glenn do you know whats the percentage of the loan book now tied to onemonth libor and prime has that changed glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so we have about billion tied to onemonth libor and another say billion tied to prime jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 great thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp on a total book of billion jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker with compass point please proceed with your question laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah hi thanks good morning and john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc john and jim i just want to also echo what others have said congratulations just going back to hsas can you help us think about we saw a drop i guess if you will on hsas or rather an increase in hsa efficiency ratio so itd been previously running and it was can you help us think about how thats going to look going forward glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure so i think a lot will depend on the enrollment period as chad highlighted and the balances that we get i think one of the factors that is driving that laurie is the reduction in the credit rate from if you just look from yearoveryear fourth quarter versus prior years fourth quarter the credit rate that we apply to the deposits is down basis points so on a base of billion that has an impact so thats one of the things you see driving that the other side of it is on the expense side as chad pointed out we continue to invest in the frontend customer experience and things like that all for the longer term view of capturing more market share laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 okay thats helpful and then do you all have any goals with respect to what you would like hsa ppnr to be relative to websters ppnr as you roll forward and again that had been tracking closer to came in at this quarter john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc how should we be thinking about that next year thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean its a very interesting question laurie weve always managed it as and youve heard jim say this before me so this is about a fiveyear consistent messages that we want to kind of maximize the value of hsa given its growth potential and its unique characteristics so we dont look at it as what is the optimal level of contribution our real focus is at some point if it got to be too big a concentration risk or other elements we might think about other strategic alternatives but right now in this if you look at it from round numbers the commercial banks contributing about of ppnr for the full year chads group is about to and then the balance in community banking we think thats a really good mix and based on our forecast going forward chad will be a bigger contributor relative to community banking but it certainly wont get to a place where we think we need to make adjustments in our strategy laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thats great and then can you just update us on the relationships you flagged last quarter so you had the likely departure of two custodial hsa relationships from the thirdparty administrator wholesale portfolio i think one was being acquired and one was becoming a nonbank custodian can you just help us think about where we are in seeing that reflected in the balances john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes and i can answer that question i think really easily and clearly so the guidance doesnt change meaning over the next six quarters that whole activity will result in financial neutrality given the fact that we get exit fees and some other income as those accounts leave in no accounts moved and we received none of that compensation so there was no noise in the numbers either in balances or in the pl related to those and we believe that that will start impacting us in the first quarter when we report to you on our full enrollment period as we said last quarter we will provide in each quarter growth dynamics of hsa with and without those two custodial accounts and well let you know whats moved out and what portion of income is also related to exit fees and other so well be very careful and very transparent but in q4 there was no impact at all laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then would you just remind us what those two relationships constitute just in terms of hsa deposits as well as investments webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah what we reported that in the last quarter im looking at the notes laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc i think we had an estimate last quarter that put it around backed into million but i just dont have anything specific and i didnt know if you have anything that was more tightened down charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp were just grabbing the number for you laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay okay great and then one other question while youre looking at back on oh go ahead terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp million in accounts and million john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp right million in accounts roughly million in balances related to two accounts laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and thats million in deposits or in total footings terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp deposits charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp in deposits yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc in deposits okay perfect super helpful okay and then just glenn two more quick questions number one your lending club balance and then number two if you could just help us think about tax rate i think you said in your comments to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp right laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc which is a slight change i think from where we were previously at and i just wanted to understand that change thanks glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and im sorry your first question i didnt get laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc oh i was just looking for the balance on the lending club loans john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp its million glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yes john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp flat for last quarter ph weve said no issues no changes in asset quality or performance glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and then the only thing i would say about our full year forecast on taxes its primarily driven by lower tax credits and other discrete benefits that we received in laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks thanks very much john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you laurie operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens inc please proceed with your question webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 matt breese q analyst stephens inc good morning everybody john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey matt good morning matt breese q analyst stephens inc just curious i was hoping you could talk a little bit about new commercial real estate and ci loan yields and spreads and how that compares to whats on the average balance sheet today john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure ill give you a little bit of data so if you think about just ill give you a perspective on originated cre the average spread was ph and so if you think about the libor plus ph in our cre as opposed to kind of libor plus ph mid in sponsor and specialty that kind of gives you the delta in spreads and what mix can do ultimately when we have a mix change what else can i answer for you matt breese q analyst stephens inc how those spreads evolved over the past year john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp i would say theyre about in cre in this quarter theyre about to basis points lower than they were a year ago and i think as i look at all of the transactions that came in i think its just a result of asset quality less a result of competitive nature so we had a lot of high quality low ltv high debt service coverage deals come in in and so again i dont think that tells me anything about the competitive landscape as much as it does the quality of the transactions we brought in the fourth quarter matt breese q analyst stephens inc understood my last question is just around the growth outlook still very strong if you go to the middle or high end youre still looking at mid to high singledigit loan growth and versus some of your peers including in market peers its strikingly higher what do you attribute that to john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp so i think we look just internally at our momentum we have the highest pipeline in commercial bank that weve had over the last years and obviously we had a really good fourth quarter with respect to growth and so i think we go into the year with some good momentum on our average loan balances which is what drives net interest income and a pretty strong pipeline and some of the areas that generally are good growth drivers for us had slower second half to the year and just where we are we think that given as i said to collyn earlier in the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020 call given our wide portfolio of geographies and different business lines and expertise in certain industry segments we think that that midsingle digits if you will on a total portfolio basis is a good number our commercial loan growth including investor cre is probably going to be slightly higher than that with our consumer lending categories being slightly lower matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay and as we think about commercial real estate growth this quarter versus perhaps the past two or three was there a change in where you lend geography wise and if so where were you more focused this quarter than in prior periods john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp its a great question matt the chief risk officer is here in the room came in before to give me the data that theres actually really almost no geographic disparity from prior quarters so it really was a question as i mentioned earlier of significantly fewer paydowns so our originations in cre were about the same dollar size in fundings as they were a year ago it was just payments were down significantly and i took a look at the data with respect to property type geography weighted average loan to value and debt service coverage and none of those metrics really changed so i would say its blocking and tackling business as usual no change in strategy not different dynamics just significantly fewer paydowns matt breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay just one more if i could sneak it in you mentioned potential portfolio opportunities in your capital management commentary and i never really considered that for you before never thought it was on the radar can you just be a little bit more specific as to what you meant im assuming the loan portfolios but could you clarify and if so what types of asset classes and geographies are you looking for if youve looked at opportunities in past could you just give us a sense for how many john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure and weve been consistent we have talked about it and it is referring to commercial loan portfolios in particular so i would say where we look for areas where we have expertise weve looked at equipment finance portfolios some secured loan portfolios to kind of offset some of our sponsor and specialty enterprise reliant exposure so we look for good yielding economically profitable portfolio acquisitions that will either enhance an existing specialty or an existing line of business or provide us with an inroad into something that we find attractive at the current period of time the truth of the matter is we have not in the last at least eight quarters besides the residential mortgage portfolio acquisition that we did up in boston for strategic purposes we have not successfully acquired a commercial loan portfolio over the course of the last eight quarters matt breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thats all i had i appreciate taking my questions thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2020
