spent a lot of time in these last few weeks in front of our advisors first traveling with our topproducing independent advisors on a great trip great to see the success in their business and the positive nature of how they feel about the firm and then attending our rcs conference our ria division and clearing firm again that divisions over of our private client group assets now and its great to see the growth and the enthusiasm there also now turning to our results despite the challenging environment which included a regional banking crisis heightened volatility and rapidly rising interest rates we generated record net revenues and earnings for the last fiscal year thats our third consecutive year of record results in very different market environments was achieved by staying true to our core we put clients first we act with integrity we value independence and think long term these core values are more than words on a page they are lived day in and day out by our advisors and associates this dedication and focus provides stability during tough economic times and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future reviewing fourth quarter results starting on slide the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of billion and net income available to common shareholders of million or per diluted share excluding expenses related to acquisitions adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share the increase in asset management revenues and interestrelated revenues drove significant revenue growth over the prior year with net revenues increasing quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters including an incremental million provision related to the previously disclosed sec industry sweep on offplatform communications this provision resulted in an impact during the quarter of per diluted share we generated strong returns for the fiscal fourth quarter with an annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of a great result particularly given our strong capital base moving on to slide the yearoveryear client asset growth was strong driven by organic growth and all of our affiliation options along with market appreciation we ended the quarter with a total client assets under administration of trillion pcgbased assets in feebased accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion with our continuing focus on retaining supporting and attracting highquality financial advisors pcg consistently generates strong organic growth which was evident again this year with domestic net new assets of billion in the fiscal fourth quarter representing a annualized growth rate on beginning of the period domestic pcg assets for the fiscal year domestic net new assets of billion reflected a annual growth rate which is a leading result in the industry during the fiscal year we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing production and nearly billion of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 client assets of their previous firms these results do not include our ria and custody services business rcs which had another strong year in recruited results more importantly we continue to maintain a very low regrettable attrition levels of financial advisors of about these factors contributed to our annual nna growth of total clients domestic sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion down compared to june of the enhanced savings program with its competitive rate and robust fdic insurance coverage continued to attract significant cash this quarter partially offsetting a decline in client sweep balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and cash sorting activity total bank loans increased from the preceding quarter to billion reflecting muted loan demand to our target markets given rising rates and the macroeconomic uncertainty moving on to slide private client group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million yearoveryear results were lifted by strong assetbased revenues and the benefit of higher interest rates on interestrelated revenues and fees the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax loss of million revenue declined compared to the prioryear quarter mostly driven by lower fixed income brokerage and investment banking revenues however we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in ma and advisory revenues this quarter additionally our public finance business had improved results with debt underwriting growing sequentially the extremely challenging market environment particularly for investment banking has strained the nearterm profitability of segment results and as we explained previously the segment results are negatively impacted by amortization of sharebased compensation from prior years as well as growth investments we remain focused on managing controllable expenses as nearterm revenues are depressed the asset management segment generated pretax income of million and net revenues of million the increases in net revenues and pretax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher assets in pcg feebased accounts at the beginning of a quarterly billing period and strong net flows in raymond james investment management which generated million sic million of net inflows during the fiscal fourth quarter and billion of net inflows in the fiscal year the bank segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million fourth quarter nim for the bank segment of declined basis points compared to a yearago quarter and basis points compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to a highercost mix of deposits we continued to add diverse highercost funding sources with our enhanced savings program and consequentially shifted more of the lower cost suite funding to thirdparty banks in a few minutes paul shoukry will discuss this further while this negatively impacted the bank segment nim there is an offset in higher rjbdp thirdparty bank fees so still a net positive for the firm overall while also providing advisors an attractive deposit alternative to offer their clients looking at fiscal results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion and record net income available to common shareholders of billion up and respectively over the prior years records additionally we generated strong returns on common equity of and adjusted returns on tangible common equity of for the fiscal year on slide the strength of the pcg and bank segments for the fiscal year primarily reflects the benefit of strong organic growth in the private client group the successful integration of tristate capital and the benefit from higher shortterm interest rates when compared to the record activity levels in the yearago period weaker capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues despite incremental revenues from the sumridge acquisition which we completed in june of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 and now i will turn it over to paul shoukry for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter results paul paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting on slide consolidated net revenues were a record billion in the fourth quarter up over the prior year and sequentially asset management and related administrative fees grew compared to the prioryear quarter and sequentially due to the higher assets in feebased accounts at the end of the preceding quarter this quarter feebased assets declined which will be a headwind for our asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter of brokerage revenues of million were flat yearoveryear and increased sequentially yearoveryear the lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the capital markets segment were offset by higher brokerage revenues in pcg ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million declined yearoveryear sequentially the increase was driven predominantly by higher ma and advisory revenues as well as a solid quarter for public finance we are cautiously optimistic that the environment for ma is improving and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity however there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility and geopolitical concerns so while we may not see a significant improvement in the next fiscal quarter we are hoping for better results over the next to months other revenues of million were down compared to the prioryear quarter primarily due to lower revenues from affordable housing investments the pipeline for that business remains strong but several closings slipped to fiscal due to higher interest rates moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion down compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets advisors continue to serve their clients effectively leveraging our competitive cash offerings the enhanced savings program grew approximately billion in deposits this quarter a large portion of the total cash coming into esp has been new cash brought to the firm by advisors highlighting the attractiveness of this product and raymond james being viewed as a source of strength and stability as many eligible clients have now taken advantage of this product the pace of flows into the enhanced savings program has understandably decelerated through monday of this week sweep and esp balances are down approximately million for the month of october as growth in esp balances was more than offset by the quarterly fee billings as expected we continue to believe we are closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than we are to the beginning however until rates stabilize we would not be surprised to see further yieldseeking behavior by clients sweep balances with thirdparty banks were billion at the quarterend giving us a large funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface the strong growth of enhanced savings program balances at raymond james bank has allowed for more balances to be deployed offbalance sheet while this dynamic has negatively impact the bank segments nim because of the geography of the lowercost sweep balances being swept offbalance sheet it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firms funding flexibility looking forward we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 turning to slide combined net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million nearly flat from the immediately preceding quarter as a sequential decrease in firmwide net interest income was offset by higher rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks if you recall on our last earnings call we anticipated a sequential decline in these interestrelated revenues so we are pleased with the betterthanexpected result which was partly a function of higherthananticipated yields on rjbdp thirdparty balances the bank segments net interest margin decreased basis points sequentially to for the quarter while the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased basis points to while there are many variables that will impact actual results absent any changes to shortterm interest rates we currently expect combined net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks to be around lower in the fiscal first quarter as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter and thats just based on spot balances after the fee billings this quarter as experienced over the past two quarters this guidance may prove to once again be conservative if cash sweep balances stabilize around current levels andor if the bank assets grow more than anticipated during the rest of the quarter but as we have always said instead of concentrating on maximizing nim over the near term we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income and rjbdp fees over the long term which we believe we are still wellpositioned to do as many of you may recall our expectation has always been that the industry would overearn an interest income early on in a rising rate environment and then experience some normalization of interest earnings as clients redeploy their cash to higheryielding alternatives moving to consolidated expenses on slide compensation expense was billion and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was the adjusted compensation ratio was during the quarter which we are very pleased with especially given the challenging environment for capital markets non compensation expenses of million increased sequentially as paul reilly mentioned earlier the fiscal fourth quarter included the incremental provision related to the previously disclosed sec industry sweep on off platform communications of million resulting in an impact during the quarter of per diluted share combined with the provision in the fiscal third quarter we are confident that we are now fully reserved for this matter the bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of million increased million over the prior year quarter and decreased million compared to the preceding quarter ill discuss more related to the credit quality in the bank segment shortly in summary while there has been some noise with elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters this year adjusted noncompensation expenses excluding loan loss provision and those legal and regulatory provisions came in very close to our annual expectation of billion reinforcing that we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the current quarter we generated a pretax margin of and adjusted pretax margin of a strong result given the industrywide challenges impacting capital markets in the aforementioned legal and regulatory provision on slide at quarterend total assets were billion a sequential increase liquidity and capital remain very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion wellabove our billion target the tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be wellcapitalized the tier leverage ratio reflects nearly billion of excess capital raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 above our conservative target which would still be times more than the regulatory requirement to be well capitalized our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth we also have significant sources of contingent funding we have a million revolving credit facility and nearly billion of fhlb capacity in the bank segment slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters during the fiscal year the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million an average price of per share as of october approximately million remained available under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization while we didnt complete any repurchases in the fourth quarter due to selfimposed restrictions just to be prudent given our knowledge of the aforementioned sec offplatform matter we remain committed to our planned repurchases to offset dilution from the tristate capital acquisition and the sharebased compensation as we previously discussed lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of total corporate loans held for investment was at quarterend we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation supply chain constraints higher interest rates and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio given industrywide challenges we continue to closely monitor the commercial real estate portfolio and more specifically the office portfolio we have prudently limited the exposure to office loans which represents just of the bank segments total loans now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as i said from the start of the call i am pleased with our results for the fiscal and our ability to generate record earnings even in challenging market conditions the record results this fiscal year once again highlight the strength of our diverse and complementary businesses and while there is still nearterm economic uncertainty i believe we are in a position of strength and are wellpositioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the sequential decline in assets in feebased accounts near term we expect some headwinds to interestsensitive earnings at both pcg and the bank segment given ongoing cash sorting activity however i am optimistic we will continue delivering industryleading growth as current and prospective advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and leading technology and product solutions our advisor recruiting activity has picked up significantly over the last two months with record numbers of large teams in the pipeline in the capital markets segment as we saw this quarter there are some signs of improvement in investment banking and we continue to have a healthy ma pipeline and good engagement levels but while theres still reason for optimism we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would expect activity to likely pick up over the next to months raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 and in the fixed income space the dynamic for the last year persists depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities putting pressure on our brokerage activity we hope once rates and cash balances stabilize we can start to see an improvement so while there are some nearterm challenges we believe the capital markets business is wellpositioned for growth given the investments weve made over the past five years which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share in the asset management segment financial assets under management are starting the fiscal quarter down compared to the preceding quarter which should create a headwind to revenue we remain confident that strong growth of assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution operational and marketing synergies in the bank segment we remain focused on fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand we have seen securitiesbased loan payoffs decelerate and are starting to experience growth we expect demand for these loans to recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates with little activity in the market corporate loan growth has been tepid however spreads have improved and with ample cash sitting on thirdparty banks and lots of capital we are well positioned to lend once activity increases in closing entering fiscal we believe our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses along with our ample capital and liquidity has us wellpositioned to drive future growth i want to thank our advisors and associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day especially in uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most thank you for all you do that concludes our prepared remarks operator will you open the line for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from dan fannon with jefferies your line is open daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks was hoping you could expand upon the record backlog you talked about for advisors joining your platform maybe some context around the size and scope of that and also it seems like there is more industry movement you mentioned attrition being very low for the year just wondering if youre seeing any uptick in terms of attrition across your platform more recently as you mentioned more advisor movement across the industry paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay well good question i think that first the attrition still stayed around thats slightly up from last year but its the same ballpark kind of rounding so were happy to see that given the markets been very very competitive if you look at industry data advisor movement is down about industrywide if you believe the data but what were seeing in terms what were not seeing in number of advisors were seeing in size of team so just last month we added a bank platform in billion in assets advisors and when we look at the backlog especially in the last two months the number of teams that are generating million to million of revenue weve never had so many come through at once so that has been a really big pickup that and the pipeline not saying were going to close them all but weve never had this many at one time where were down to the final kind of negotiating line so as well as people that have committed we havent announced so its been a pickup from a little slower activity but i would say that between last year and this year its just last year it was larger teams at the end this year its just significant number of very large teams that are in the pipeline daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks thats helpful and then just a question as you think about this coming fiscal year and expenses if the capital markets activity remains somewhat depressed or around these levels should we think about noncomp expense or i guess how should we think about noncomp expense and levers that you think or youre looking to pull to potentially improve the profitability andor even maintain profitability in a more challenged revenue environment paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean for the capital markets specifically most of the expenses are comp expenses and we had continued to invest in that business even through this difficult environment we were opportunistic as we explained in our analyst day in adding about a dozen mds particularly to our healthcare group and other groups so were still investing in the business long term we think its attractive we have a great platform there really if you look at the losses that indiscernible segment generated this year about million of it or million of it or so was related to growth expenses and retention expense deferred comp expenses that raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 were advertising throughout the year so more than the entire loss of the segment was really growth related or deferred comp related so overall the firm noncompensation expenses we expect will continue to grow we managed them very well this year i talked about excluding the legal and regulatory and the loan loss provision very close to that billion target we laid out a year ago and we expect it to continue growing from this level because a lot of those costs are growth expenses whether it would be the fdic insurance expense as we continue to put more deposits at the bank et cetera so they were negatively impacted this year by the legal and regulatory after a very benign year last year but net net we would continue to expect noncompensation expenses to grow while also being very focused on managing the controllable expenses that we can manage while still ensuring high support levels for advisors and their clients daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator our next question comes from kyle voigt with kbw your line is open kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening so just with the nearly billion of excess capital above that target you mentioned the suspension of repurchases in the quarter due to knowing about the regulatory matter i guess when we think about the pace of repurchases in fiscal paul should we still think about that million to million per quarter run rate or should we expect a little bit of a catchup given there were no repurchases last quarter and given how much excess capital you have on the balance sheet paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think when you think about excess capital i would just start with capital prioritization framework that weve been following almost since our inception really which is first and foremost to use the excess capital to invest in growth so paul talked about the prospects that we have for organic growth which were pretty bullish on right now just given the pipelines not only in pcg but really across our businesses and then were also active on the acquisition front looking at opportunities that are good cultural fit first and foremost but that would also be good strategic fit and pricing across all ma right now is challenging because there are gaps between buyers and sellers but we feel like we can through continued dialogue find good opportunities there over time and then to the extent that we can invest the capital in growth and we have this our ongoing dividend which is to of earnings and then buybacks and we do have to play some catchup on the buyback since we didnt do any this quarter i think wed have about million more to offset the issuance associated with tristate acquisition and two years of sharebased compensation so well get back to doing that and then we have a commitment to offset dilution going forward which is about million a year but if we have the excess capital which we currently have and we deem the price to be attractive then we would obviously be opportunistic above and beyond that offsetting of dilution kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 great thank you and then just for a followup just want to touch on the admin comp line within the pcg segment moved lower sequentially in the quarter came in a bit lower than expected i guess if we take a step back and look at the full year that admin comp grew by more than which is a similar rate to fiscal although i think there were some acquisitions in there and some unusual or higherthanexpected raises that went into effect over that period i guess as we look out to fiscal or over the medium term is how should we think about growth in that admin comp line on a normalized basis paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey you touched on it i mean that growth in pcg admin comp does include growth investments full year of charles stanley is in there as well as all of the support staff for all of the advisors that we bring onboard that their compensation goes into the admin comp as well so weve invested in the platform and this year we added on top of that as you pointed out we are very generous in passing on the financial success with associates in the form of higher raises last year and thats reflected in these numbers as well looking forward we are again focused on while expecting continued growth in this line item certainly wed expect it to sort of be a reduction in the growth rate from what we experienced this year given the aforementioned factors kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open benjamin rubin q analyst ubs securities llc hi this is ben rubin filling in for brennan thank you for taking my question i first want to ask about the composition of the loan book we did see some growth in the loan book in the balance sheet for the first time in several quarters and i guess my first question is how are you thinking about balance sheet growth on the loan side in fiscal year maybe on commercial versus consumer underwriting and then also what type of balance sheet growth does your nii guide interpret as we look to next quarter thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah the nearterm nii guide factors in very modest loan growth just given the environment still in terms of the demand being pretty muted particularly on the corporate side now but we were pleased to see the growth during the quarter and a lot of it was driven by securitiesbased loans and residential mortgages and while we expect mortgage volumes to decelerate given much higher rates now we are optimistic about the securitiesbased loan portfolio in both raymond james bank and tristate as we look forward over the next months and thats based on two factors the first is the repayments of those balances have really stabilized as you would expect accelerated significantly as rates were rising almost doubling in some cases over the last months and so that has stabilized and we are starting to see new originations and on the tristate capital side a lot of benefit from what they call transitions or essentially existing clients bringing on and recruiting new advisors so we are optimistic about that portfolio going forward over the next months raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i would just add we are open for business we have more than adequate cash in the buffer and certainly the capital and its really just the loan demand so hopefully the sbls continue to go from being repaid to starting to grow as we saw the indication last quarter the mortgage business is obviously slow and the commercial loans were open to it but its a very slow market and the spreads are widening for the deals that are coming out but again its more of a muted market so you saw this quarter were open for business we have to find the loans that were comfortable with so benjamin rubin q analyst ubs securities llc great thats very helpful and then for my followup ill kind of touch back on what dans first question about net new assets so net new asset growth in the quarter was its a bit below the highsingledigit percentages you guys have been printing in recent years i was just wondering if you can give me some color if there was any noise any advisor departures that were lumpy that may have impacted the quarter and whether or not this lets call it midsingledigit range is more appropriate or should we kind of is it some revert back to the highsingle digits once the advisor market if it does improve from here thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think for the quarter i mean its been a dynamic year in a lot of ways in terms of as you look at advisor count i think that we had one program which we previously talked about that we exited from the platform we kept of advisors left and it cost us billion in assets and advisors but we think from a profitability and long term it was the right program if you look just this month again adding a billion bank program and advisors just among the crew a lot of big projects like that so were still optimistic whether we can hit to doubledigit suite in a couple of quarters thats a big number depending on the markets but we expect to do very very well but thatll be up to kind of recruiting and what happens to the capital markets so indiscernible benjamin rubin q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good afternoon paul and paul paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey steve paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey so wanted to start off with a question on spread revenue came in better than your guidance in the quarter it also trended better than what we saw at some of your peers and given you have a larger proportion of client cash that swept to thirdparty banks to what extent did the spread revenue benefit from improved pricing from those partner banks provide any incremental boost we know banks are seeking out alternative sources of liquidity theres a lot of demand for that whether you benefited from any improved pricing on some of those thirdparty sweeps paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i think our better performance than many peers is really just a reflection of our longterm focus of kind of maintaining a flexible approach thats focused on giving clients as much fdic insurance as possible and you see that with the growth in enhanced savings program balances which give us more flexibility in that dry powder that effectively puts more sweep balances with thirdparty banks as we await growth of the banks balance sheet as paul discussed earlier and that dynamic as you point out steve is absolutely correct the demand from thirdparty banks is only increasing by the week and as contracts renew we are able to renew at more favorable terms so that played a role but bigger picture what really played a role was us just maintaining that sort of longterm flexible approach to managing the balance sheet and offering clients as much fdic coverage as we possibly can through our various products steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and for my followup wanted to drill down in terms of some of the october deposit trends paul that you had cited given the sensitivity of spread revenue to changes in deposit mix i was hoping you could provide some additional granularity disaggregating the sweep and esp deposit levels and maybe help size the impact of the advisor payout paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc when you say the advisor payout are you referring to the quarterly fee billings or what do you steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc quarterly fee billings which honestly i care less about that i really just was hoping to get the esp and sweep deposit levels paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah okay steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc disaggregated given the sensitivity raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc got it yeah so we were down as of couple of days ago million but this does bounce around from day to day i mean we had a million positive day yesterday so paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc at quarterend we had a million day so the balances are at numbers were not used to high and low coming in and out paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc the enhanced savings program is up probably million to million so far this month and so the offset to that would obviously be the sweep balances which frankly are doing much better than we would have expected given that we had the quarterly fee billings earlier this month as well so netnet for cash to be down million to million when you add those two components considering the billion of quarterly fee billings were pretty pleased with our situation right now but again day to day could change today or tomorrow so were going to monitor it closely paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think the important steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful color thank you for taking my sorry paul go ahead paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah the important thing for us i mean just not on earnings but the fact that we have so much money to third party banks that we could use if we wanted it and we really indiscernible havent been borrowing so we have a lot of comfort to be able to go ahead and still have all the flexibility we need but there has been the mix change with esp with higher deposit costs and thats what youve been seeing netnet steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats helpful color thanks for taking my questions paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks steve operator our next question comes from mark mclaughlin with bank of america your line is open raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc hi thanks for taking my question i was hoping you could provide us with some more color around deposit cost mix and specifically the pickup in money market and savings account yields paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah so i think we just sort of covered the growth in the enhanced savings program balance for us i mean in terms the deposit costs that is the biggest factor because that does cost somewhere around and so to the extent that the mix of the total client cash balances shift to those enhanced savings program balances youre picking up probably or so percentage points of costs effectively so i would say thats probably the biggest factor and the higher deposit costs and while you saw the nim really contract sequentially it was largely due to us intentionally growing the higher cost deposits but again a lot of that is geography because effectively what we have done is raise the highercost deposits of the bank segment through the enhanced savings program and then essentially shifted more of the lowercost sweep balances to thirdparty banks and so that shows the nim at the bank segment contracting sequentially but you see the corresponding benefit to the firm with thirdparty fees which shows up in the pcg segment and thats why as steve pointed out we were able to generate betterthanexpected and betterthan industry trends at least indiscernible sequential basis mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc yeah very clear i appreciate that context also for my followup how has feedback and adoption for rcs been i was curious on what the mix between outside advisors joining the platform was versus the transition of existing advisors on the platform paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think that the growth has been great were over now of our assets in the rcs division when we first probably opened it we had a bigger movement of internal people who wanted to go ria that just switch platform which again as part of the noise and advisor count when advisors move from our employer independent division we count them as advisors and once theyre in the rcs theyre not registered theyre ria so theyre one firm right so we drop them out of the advisor count so but the assets would stay and i think the proof point in that is the growth the nna in assets which i think for the year and for the quarter have been above most of the players in the market the speed and the recruiting outside has picked up too now that weve gotten the platform much more robust increased the technology significantly hopefully the longterm growth will come from the outside but we do have people here if they want to operate in the ria format theyre welcome to switch affiliation options but that has slowed down over the last couple of years from the initial opening of it so more people came over mark mclaughlin q analyst bofa securities inc appreciate the color thanks guys raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 operator our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thanks good afternoon guys maybe paul i mean you talked a lot about sorting i guess starting to decelerate esp growth decelerating you have some pricing benefits on thirdparty sweeps if we look beyond the first quarter or next quarter in terms of the guidance on ratesensitive revenue do you start to see things stabilizing i guess im not asking for specific guidance but if you could kind of help us think through the puts and takes and when we start to see those revenues maybe potentially stabilize paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i dont think anyone can really tell you exactly when cash sorting will fully stabilize across the industry i know a lot of firms have been trying to convince you of that for the last to months but weve been trying to be pretty transparent with you guys and so what we have said in the last three months at least is that we feel like were closer to the end of the sorting dynamic than the beginning and you sort of are seeing that in the numbers but were not going to sort of declare an end to that dynamic until we have several months of data to support that but to your point longer term we are excited about the position that were in now with the strong capital position with the billion almost of cash with thirdparty banks that gives us a lot of dry powder to really grow the balance sheet when the attractive opportunities come and we think well be in a position of strength there because not a lot of other firms in our space will have the capital and funding to pursue that attractive growth so were in a great position again its a reflection of that longterm client focus the flexible balance sheet that weve always strived to maintain even when being criticized for it over the last few years but were in a pretty good position now paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc jim i think for us to really be able to call it in and is really when interest rates stabilize if the fed was starting to raise rates again and ultimately the securities in i guess money market funds and you have a higherrate competitor so you have to raise rates i mean thats really the dynamic and it appears that the fed is closer to the end of the cycle of doing that and rates stabilize i think the sorting will stabilize also jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right thats fair and maybe just the followup on the credit side some pretty big additions to reserves you said you feel comfortable i guess what changes that you mentioned macro just trying to think through how youre feeling about the credit provision story there given that loan growth has been pretty flattish paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc we think credits are up we like the profile we like the risk weve always tried to be proactive on adding to reserves to make sure were wellreserved and often are a bit ahead of movements the one thing we dont control sometimes is our models some of our macroeconomic models are based on indiscernible but we try to stay ahead of the credit and were as you could see in through a very tough credit period we did pretty well were pretty credittough maybe it was different this cycle and starting in covid we have sold off raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 loans so we didnt like the credit yield tradeoffs and risk tradeoffs and weve continued to do that kind of a one off basis so thats been an extra tool that we use to manage credit so were feeling pretty good now if the economy spins out of control then weve got other issues but it seems like even if things slow down which they may as long as people are employed and buying we think well get through it pretty well so jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right so the additions are more macrodriven rather than specific concerns internally paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say the additions this quarter were sort of a number of itemspecific loans where we as paul said tried to get in front of it with additional reserves when possible there are also modest amount i think chargeoffs were flat sequentially so nothing dramatic we feel good about the portfolio overall but we try to get ahead of things especially when the market environment is as unpredictable as it is as paul said jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc for the last quarter the macro had a bigger impact but this quarter it wasnt a big macro outlook change this quarter paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thats right jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thank you very much operator our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great thanks paul and paul and most have been covered here but i do want to just touch on the fixed income businesses briefly so your debt underwriting obviously had its best quarter in some time can be a little bit of seasonality there but did have a better result than some peers so just curious whether thats some idiosyncratic deals or if youre actually seeing conditions for that business maybe starting to improve a little bit from depressed levels and then i guess conversely the fixed income brokerage business took a little bit of a step lower from already a pretty tough level so just whether you see any catalysts on the horizon that could drive better results there as well raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think the fixed income debt certainly the activity was up we did have a pretty big deal in the quarter also so that was part of the pickup and longterm client were in rotation we happened to have a big hard turn for kind of the big underwriting so its a little bit of both i would say but certainly the big deal had an impact and the lack of interest rate kind of as paul talked about was the depositories without excess cash still waiting for stabilizing too so that part of our franchise has certainly been slow and i think in general the trading has been as you look at spreads whether in triplea munis or mortgage securities or stuff they have very high spreads right now people are just waiting for rates to pick up because certainly the spreads there are higher than theyve been in a while but the activity is not way up so i think people are waiting to feel like they know where interest rates are going to stabilize and until then its going to be a tough business maybe a little better its hard indiscernible a lot lower not impossible but when it really picks up i think youre going to have to see more of a stabilized outlook and interest rates devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc got it okay paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc indiscernible done extremely well since joining us so theyve been a great addition and wellahead of what we would expect and the traditional business has been at lows given this interest rate environment devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah got it okay good color there and then just a followup briefly just on kind of corporate ma i hear all the comments around growth opportunities with capital and obviously opportunistic buybacks but just more broadly how you would just characterize the flow deals youre seeing across the firm right now and then just where the appetite is at the moment just given the higher cost of capital how much of that calculation maybe appetite for ma has changed because you guys clearly have been acquisitive over the last several years here paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that first cost of capital is in packing deals so its two things first its pricing so with the buyers the cost of capital saying well this is significantly higher and pricing has been slower to come down which isnt unusual in another ma cycle so that went through the prices the slowest to adjust and so we have empathy for ma bankers as we look at things too we have the same thing when you look at debt was free and you layer on a seven or eight or nine or whatever the cost of rate is especially for a lot of ma firms where its more higher risk debt i mean it impacts the pricing it just has to so we see that both in the ma business its back up so you can see people doing deals now in the fourth quarter we dont expect the next quarter to be a lot different but the backlog is good people are waiting but that gap which i think a lot of its from leveling pricing and the cost of capital is impacting it and we see it all the firms and id say the same thing when we run numbers it has an impact even with our excess capital we assume we have to replace it it makes it tougher unless prices adjust a little bit or cost of capital falls its going to be harder raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 or people just waited out long enough and go okay the lower price is the new price its going to take one of those factors for it to really pick up so thats why we gave more of a to 12month outlook in our ma business just we think that the market is starting to see that but lets see if that adjusts or not and i dont think its going to happen overnight devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thats great ill leave it there thanks guys paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc all right thanks devin paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator our final question comes from michael cyprys with morgan stanley your line is open michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good evening thanks for squeezing me in here just a question on the bank capital rules weve seen some proposals from the banking regulators including the basel iii endgame proposal just curious how you see that impacting the opportunity set for your capital markets business given youre under the billion asset threshold just curious how you think about the opportunity set for yourselves but then as you look out over the coming years im sure eventually you probably hope you cross billion and grow to that level just how do you think about that impacting potentially your capital markets business which area you think might be more impacted and how do you think about preparing for that paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well couple of things first at our billion and growth its going to take a lot of time to get to billion and i think people forget that one of the big jumps in our assets is because of the tristate acquisition we have no plans to acquire another bank in fact it took us five years of looking to acquire tristate which was the perfect fit to joining the family but were not looking for another banking franchise almost anything else we do doesnt significantly drive our asset size so we think weve got certainly id say five years you have to cross and then you get a year to comply so and it could be much longer so most of all the rules as you cited are with the billion and so i think we have time to do that and having said that were already internally doing studies on the impact of reporting requirements the capital requirements the technology everything thats going to be impacted and the regulatory expectations which do change when you cross billion so we have both inside and outside help weve been hiring some people and this is kind of five years in advance raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 so were not taking it for granted we know well grow but as you said almost the billion became the old billion before they changed the rule billion so it has brought a lot of those rules down for significantly higher lift but i think right now thats in the future for us still a ways paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc and just to add one thing to that timeline one of the reasons that itll be we expect it to be around that long is because one of the things we did during covid is really accommodated client cash balances on the balance sheet for the securities portfolio so we expect over the next year for example for a lot of the banks loan growth to be essentially funded with securities that mature out of that portfolio so you dont get as much net growth movement from the loan growth because its a repositioning of those assets paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah thanks paul its a clarification there because we still expect to grow the bank loan portfolio so but its being funded onbalance sheet not offbalance sheet michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and just a followup on that point as banks that are impacted by the rules either pull back in certain areas or reprice certain products how do you think about the opportunity set for you guys to step in given that the rules wont apply you for many years where do you see the biggest opportunity set for your capital markets business are more broadly from these rules impacting a lot of banks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that if you look at acquiring capital markets businesses or fixed income businesses or asset management businesses really dont significantly impact our asset size so what would really impact that is acquiring a bank because youre acquiring balance sheet those businesses especially the ma fixed income like even today we operate when morgan keegan joined us seven or eight years ago we had billion of inventory they had billion in their inventory today we have less weve operated wellunder billion in inventory so we think theres a lot of room to acquire a lot of business if those businesses in that space without really altering trajectory i talked about to billion its the banking size that impacts the balance sheet really and that is not our focus so michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator this concludes our qa session i will now turn the call back to paul reilly for closing remarks paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so first i appreciate the time its been really outside the kind of a regulatory charge it would have been a really outstanding quarter it still is a very good quarter and so were focused still going into an uncertain market but raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25oct2023 weve always i think that our business have outperformed because of our capital and cash and especially in downmarkets be nice to be in upcapital markets and interest rates to come in and itll be kind of an easy year but we always assume we have to work for it over a year market is competitive so were just doing what weve done weve been managing expenses lot of people say what are you going to do to manage your expenses we have been doing that especially over the last few quarters and plan to continue to do that so we can see growth to support those so appreciate you joining the call and all the time you spent with us and well talk to you soon operator this concludes todays conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect
