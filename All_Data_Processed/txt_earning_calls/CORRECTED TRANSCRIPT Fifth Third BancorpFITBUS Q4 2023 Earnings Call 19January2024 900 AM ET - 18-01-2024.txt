them following prepared remarks by tim and bryan we will open the call up for questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 with that let me turn it over to tim timothy n spence chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp thanks matt and good morning everyone at fifth third we believe that great banks distinguish themselves based on how they navigate challenging and uncertain operating environments was certainly a challenging year for the industry but i am very pleased with how we measured up our defensive balance sheet positioning strong execution and multiyear strategic investments produced top quartile profitability the best core deposit growth and the best total shareholder return among all regional peers who did not participate in an fdicassisted transaction we generated an alltime record fullyear revenue of billion deposits grew compared to an industrywide decline of credit performance was strong with net chargeoffs remaining below historical averages and although it would be foolish to expect it to repeat forever in commercial real estate we experienced zero net chargeoffs in and only basis points of delinquent loans as of early january these strong outcomes combined with our multiyear expense discipline produced a fullyear adjusted return on assets of an adjusted return on tangible common equity ex aoci of and an adjusted efficiency ratio of all among the best of our peers we also continued to take market share organically by growing our customer base and deepening relationships we grew consumer households by overall punctuated by growth in the southeast in commercial we added a record number of new quality middle market relationships up over the prior year as a result we grew or maintained our deposit market share position in all of our largest msas as we turn the page to we remain focused on differentiating fifth third based on the strength and consistency of our financial performance by prioritizing stability profitability and growth in that order bryan will take you through the detail on the fourth quarter and our outlook for the year shortly but before that i would like to touch on a few points the first of these is the strength of our balance sheet our defensive positioning and decision to move quickly to adapt to proposed regulatory changes have put us in a position to play offense in having achieved full category i lcr compliance on august and maintained it since our liquidity position is very strong we completed our rwa diet in the fourth quarter and accreted nearly basis points of cet1 putting us on pace to reach a cet1 ratio by midyear given our strong earnings profile and the significant rally in interest rates in december our tangible book value per share grew nearly during the fourth quarter at the beginning of january we moved billion of securities to held to maturity representing roughly one quarter of our afs portfolio we expect this move will derisk potential aoci volatility to capital by about in the event that market rates rise again if the economic outlook remains stable and the capital rules are finalized no worse than the current npr these actions put us in a position to resume share repurchases of up to million to million in the second half of including million to million as early as the beginning of the third quarter should the final rules prove less stringent than the initial proposals well have additional flexibility in deploying excess capital and liquidity to further improve profitability and position fifth third for growth the second point id like to highlight is profitability expense discipline strong returns and positive operating leverage remain core areas of focus for fifth third supported by our technology modernization investments and a focus on leaning out key value streams we reduced fulltime equivalent employee head count by from our peak in to the end of the year without the need for a companywide expense program the run rate benefits fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 of these efforts put us in a position to sustain the peerleading annualized expense growth that we have averaged the past several years even as we continue to invest for growth while the carryover effect of the rwa diet makes it unfeasible for the full year we do anticipate returning to positive operating leverage in the second half of the third point id like to highlight is about growth our strategies have been consistent building out our southeast markets producing a strong fee to total revenue mix and leveraging software that differentiates our product offerings and improves productivity these are multiyear investments that cannot be replicated easily by competitors through one to two years of hiring a few new branches or small tuckin acquisitions in we opened new branches concentrated in the southeast bringing us to opened over the past five years we plan to open another branches in the southeast in as a portfolio these branches have continued to outperform our expectations on both household acquisition and deposit growth and should provide a tailwind for several years forward we also continue to invest in treasury management wealth and asset management and capital markets all three of these businesses grew for us in and we expect mid to high singledigit growth in each in in treasury management our acquisitions of rize and big data healthcare and the launch of newline our embedded payments business should continue to support peerleading performance in wealth and asset management global finance recently named our private bank as best us regional private bank for the fifth consecutive year and best private bank for entrepreneurs globally for the first time in our capital markets business we have seen more robust activity levels to start the year including an ma pipeline that is times the full year revenue target embedded in our guidance overall we expect to be a solid year of improving revenue trends and continued expense discipline given what we believe to be a less certain outlook than the markets would imply we are positioned to perform well under a range of economic and interest rate scenarios before i hand it over to bryan i want to say thank you to our employees for hustling to deliver great results in and for the job you do every day to take care of our customers and communities you make our company the special place it is with that ill now turn it over to bryan to provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and our current outlook for bryan preston executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thanks tim and thank you to everyone joining us today was a very different year than what we were expecting months ago for fifth third our success in outperforming this year was driven by our intentional actions to create and maintain flexibility for navigating uncertainty as we enter we are very pleased with the results from and how we continue to be wellpositioned for a wide range of economic outcomes we have optionality in our balance sheet and diversification in our business mix that will allow us to adapt to changing environments as tim mentioned achieving this positioning requires discipline and years of deliberate investments our full year financial performance in benefited from this longterm investment fifth third delivered industryleading deposit growth of record revenue of billion and basis points of capital accretion during the year all while maintaining expense and credit discipline we delivered another solid quarter to end the year adjusting for the fdic special assessment and the other discrete items listed on page of our release return on assets was rotce was and our efficiency ratio was additionally we completed our fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 riskweighted asset diet in the fourth quarter which reduced rwa by which was a little more than we previously estimated the diet combined with our strong earnings led to a nearly 50basis point increase in cet1 during the quarter which ended at this capital accretion combined with the rally in market rates during the fourth quarter resulted in our proforma cet1 ratio including the aoci impact from unrealized losses on afs securities increasing to at yearend well above the minimum net interest income for the quarter was billion which was consistent with our expectations while nii continues to be impacted by the increasing cost of deposits due to higher market interest rates we have been able to build a robust liquidity position by generating peerleading core deposit growth our core interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points sequentially reflecting a cycletodate interestbearing core deposit beta of in the fourth quarter we believe maintaining significant liquidity on balance sheet is a prudent decision given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments our shortterm investments which are primarily comprised of our cash at the fed increased billion in the fourth quarter on an average basis and drove all of the basis point sequential decrease in nim excluding the impacts of securities gains losses and the visa total return swap adjusted noninterest income increased sequentially due to the growth in commercial banking mortgage wealth and card and processing revenues as well as the normal fourth quarter impact of the tra the growth in commercial banking fees was driven by strong institutional brokerage and improved corporate bond fees partially offset by lower lease remarketing revenue fourth quarter noninterest income was also impacted by the decision to eliminate our extended overdraft fee which was the driver of the decrease in service charges on deposits compared to the prior year noninterest income decreased primarily due to a million reduction in tra revenue adjusted noninterest expense increased sequentially primarily driven by the impact of the nonqualified deferred compensation mark to market which is mostly offset in securities gains losses excluding the impact of the nqdc mark which was a million expense in the fourth quarter compared to a million benefit in the prior quarter expenses were flat sequentially compared to the prior year fourth quarter expenses were down which reflects our ongoing commitment to expense discipline tim mentioned earlier moving to the balance sheet as expected total average portfolio loans and leases decreased sequentially most significantly driven by the decrease in average total commercial loans our corporate banking business experienced the biggest reductions due to the rwa diet with period end corporate banking total commitments decreasing and unused commitments decreasing period end commercial revolving utilization rate was a decrease from the prior quarter average total consumer portfolio loans and leases decreased sequentially due to our intentional pullback in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations given the rate environment partially offset by growth from dividend finance average core deposits increased sequentially driven by the growth in interest checking money market and customer cd balances dda migration is showing signs of deceleration with fourth quarter showing the smallest dollar decline in dda balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle even when adjusting for normal seasonal strength at yearend ddas as a percent of core deposits were for the quarter compared to in the prior quarter in addition to the migration impact this measure is negatively impacted by the strong interestbearing core deposit growth from new consumer and commercial relationships by segment average commercial deposits increased sequentially while both consumer and wealth deposits increased as a result of our balance sheet fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 positioning rwa diet and successgrowing deposits we achieved a loantocore deposit ratio of at year end which continues to rank as the best compared to our regional peers as tim mentioned we ended the year with full category lcr compliance at the strong funding profile provides us with great flexibility as we enter moving to credit asset quality trends remain strong and below historical averages the net chargeoff ratio was basis points which was down basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance to 89day delinquencies are flat compared to the end of the npa ratio increased basis points to basis points but remains below our 10year average of basis points we will maintain our credit discipline focusing on generating and maintaining granular highquality relationships in consumer we remain focused on lending to homeowners which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies however we are beginning and expect to continue to see normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple years from an overall credit risk management perspective we continue to assess forward looking client vulnerabilities based on firmspecific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higherforlonger interest rates may cause stress moving to the acl while our reserve coverage increased basis point sequentially to the acl balance decreased by million due to lower period end loans which was the primary driver of the release we continue to utilize moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings our capital build is pacing ahead of the expectations we set at the beginning of the rwa diet we are highly confident in our ability to build our cet1 ratio to by june as tim mentioned on january we made the decision to hold billion of securities until maturity resulting in the reclassification to htm during this decision reduces the risk of potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations under the proposed capital rules we continue to expect improvement in the unrealized losses in our remaining afs portfolio resulting in approximately of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of and approximately by assuming the forward curve plays out after the transfer to htm of the remaining afs portfolio is in bullet or lockedout securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations we continue to believe that is an appropriate nearterm operating level for our capital and as tim mentioned we expect to resume share repurchases during the second half of assuming the economic environment remains stable and the capital rules are finalized consistent with the npr moving to our current outlook we expect fullyear average total loans to be down compared to with the decrease primarily driven by the impact of the rwa diet on commercial loans and indirect consumer as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher rate environment partially offset by the continued growth of dividend and provide while we expect fullyear average total loans to decrease we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of to be up compared to the fourth quarter of commercial balances are expected to be up low single digits by the end of and dividend originations are projected between billion and billion for the full year we are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remains stable for the first quarter of we expect average total loan balances to be down again driven by the full quarter impact of the rwa diet both commercial and consumer loans should be down fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 around dividend finance originations are projected to be million to million in the first quarter total loan balances should be relatively stable throughout the first quarter we expect deposit growth to continue during with fullyear average core deposits increasing to while we expect dda migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates the pace of migration will be sensitive to the path of the fed funds rate in if rates remain at current levels we could see the dda mix dip below by the fourth quarter of however we would expect to show a more stable composition if the more aggressive rate cut forecasts were to be realized shifting to the income statement given the impact of the rwa diet on average loan balances and the impact of higher deposit costs we expect fullyear nii to decrease to our forecast assumes our security portfolio remains relatively stable and our cash levels begin a slow but steady decrease throughout this outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early january which projected six total rate cuts given the uncertainty regarding the rate outlook our balance sheet is positioned such that even with fewer rate cuts such as the threecut scenario being projected by the fomc we would expect to see only a modest deterioration in our nii outlook and would still fall within our full year guidance of down to we expect nii in the first quarter to be down to sequentially reflecting the impact of the lower average loan balances a lower day count in the quarter and higher deposit costs our current outlook assumes interestbearing core deposit costs which were basis points in the fourth quarter of increase to basis points in the first quarter a deceleration from the 24basis point increase experienced in the fourth quarter with rate cuts forecasted to begin in late march and continue through the end of the year we would expect deposit costs to decrease throughout the remainder of under this outlook the terminal beta for the rising rate cycle would be in the mid for interestbearing core deposits we continue to believe we are at our nim trough in the fourth quarter of however another quarter of outperformance in deposit growth resulting in a higherthanexpected cash position while a good outcome could impact nim by a few more basis points barring a significant change in economic outlook we would expect nii to stabilize and then begin growing sequentially during the remainder of we expect adjusted noninterest income to be up to in reflecting continued growth in treasury management revenue capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue partially offset by the fullyear impact of the elimination of our extended overdraft fee we expect mortgage origination will remain muted in and net servicing revenue to decrease modestly as the servicing portfolio upb continues to amortize lower adjusted other noninterest income which excludes the impact of the visa total return swap is expected to decline by over as tra revenue will decrease from million in to million in the fourth quarter of and we are not including any large onetime private equity gains in our forecast we expect firstquarter adjusted noninterest income to be down to compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the tra largely reflecting seasonal factors normal seasonal items include lower capital markets activity and ma activity partially offset by seasonal strength in wealth from tax planning we expect fullyear adjusted noninterest expense to be up around compared to our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid to high singledigits and sales force additions in middle market treasury management and wealth we will also close branches in to offset costs associated with the new branches opening in our highgrowth southeast markets we expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be up around compared to the fourth quarter as is always the case for us our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes excluding the seasonal items expenses would be flat in the first quarter in total our guide implies fullyear adjusted revenue to be down to and ppnr to decline in the to range this outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around for the full year a modest increase relative to driven by the decrease in nii as tim mentioned we expect positive operating leverage in the second half of compared to the second half of moving to credit we continue to expect net chargeoffs to be in the to basis point range as credit continues to normalize with first quarter net chargeoffs in the to basis point range as we return to loan growth we expect to resume provision builds assuming no change to the economic outlook loan growth and mix is expected to drive a million to million of provision build for the year with the first quarter being in the million to million range the provision build over the last three quarters of the year should be fairly even in summary is expected to be a year of transition as we begin the shift to a ratecutting cycle with our well positioned balance sheet disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle we will continue to generate longterm sustainable value for shareholders customers communities and employees with that let me turn it over to matt to open the call up for qa matt curoe senior directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks bryan before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies good morning everybody thank you for taking the question a lot of good color on the nii expectation so i appreciate that i guess just within there i think bryan you noted your comment about deposit costs decreasing through the course of this year maybe a thought or two on how those trajectories will differ in your view between the commercial and the consumer portfolios bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thanks scott great question we tell you that obviously similar to what weve seen from a rising rate perspective the commercial and the wealth betas in particular have come through recently at a much higher level were in the range of probably low to high from a beta perspective in both of those businesses cumulative betas have started to reach that point so were going to get a lot of repricing out of those portfolios as rates move lower to give you a little bit of perspective our indexed commercial deposits right now are up around billion so that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to get some price out of that book the consumer book is one that the cumulative betas in that book is kind of in the mid right now its certainly moved up from a marginal perspective and we continue to have a lot of optionality between our promos and exceptions as well as what weve done from a cd perspective where were going to be able to get rate cuts out of those portfolios as well our cd book which is billion now is fairly evenly laddered across the year with about maturities across each quarter weve been very careful as part of our pricing strategy to make sure that we could be able to reprice those down quickly if the rate environment were to change r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies perfect thank you and then separately so given that youre done with the rwa mitigation effort it sounds like youve got the option to be on your front foot to the extent that you choose to be going into the year just sort of curious what your expectation is in terms of loan demand as the year plays out timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp yeah hey scott its tim ill take that one and i mean look when we talk to customers today i think in general theyre cautious but not pessimistic so rates and the election uncertainty are definitely weighing on the appetite for new investments in the near term i dont know of anybody whos stopped an existing program or an existing investment but they are being very careful about new expansion so i dont expect that were going to see a big pickup in loan demand and im sure well get a question later on the economy were not expecting robust growth to drive the top line there its going to have to come from market fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 share gains so in our world the key areas of investment there are very clearly in the middle market where we have been very focused in driving more granularity into the ci portfolio our middle market loan production this past year was nearly split between the midwest markets including chicago and then the southeast markets and our expansion markets in california and texas and our sales force in those locations across the entire footprint is going to be up about over a threeyear period here for so weve got a good pentup sales capacity there and high activity levels thatll drive the outcome and then i think the other area of strength has been in the healthcare and telecom media and technology verticals and then in the fintech platforms right the continued seasoning in of both provide and dividend portfolios the last thing is the absence of a negative here which is the auto business our deliberate rundown of the outstandings in the auto business have created a little bit of a drag on loan growth and the combination of credit unions being a little bit more funding constrained and all the banks who exited have created a much more favorable environment for auto origination so we expect volumes there to come up were generating a volume today with a weighted average fico north of and very attractive riskadjusted spreads and that should stop the headwind and give us a more stable platform from which well get growth through the rest of the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies perfect okay great color thank you very much timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp absolutely operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi bryan timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc congratulations bryan on your new role and if jamie is listening congratulations to him as well timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp worse than that gerard jamie is here gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i hear that laugh thats great heres the ph question and you touched on it tim about the economy many of the banks you as well are following the forward curve for rates which is understandable and there fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 continue to be signs that the us economy is proving more resilient than we all expected so the question is this for the upcoming year what if were all wrong and all of a sudden we see 2pluspercent real gdp growth the fed doesnt move on rates maybe one or two cuts like what we saw in and credit remains even better how does that affect the way you approach what youve set up for i know bryan gave us some color on the different interest rate scenarios but what if we just come into this year at the end of this year it proves to be much stronger than any of us are expecting and inflation stays around timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp yeah ill leave it to bryan to provide more detail gerard but im glad you asked that question because if there is one frustration i have in particular on the way that the media is reporting on economic activity is theyre treating the world like its deterministic and its not right its stochastic in terms of the outcomes here and while you can see the slowdown in inflation you can see some slowdown in the economy in particular in specific sectors its just hard to be certain given the impact of deficit spending and the way that has continued to provide a buffer against any consumer slowdown and i think the possibility that maybe we return to a world where recessions in the us are regional as opposed to being national phenomenon which i think people have forgotten about because of the last two were driven by a global health pandemic and a global financial crisis so were trying to run the company in a way that provides an outlook on the expected outcomes in the middle of the distribution but that manages to a much more stable return profile in the event we get into either of the tails right more robust economic growth stickier inflation on one side of the equation and therefore the fed not being able to come off of its restrictive policies assessed and the other alternative where i think you have to say you have some sort of a geopolitical event that creates a price shock in energy another supply chain issue or otherwise which could trigger an unexpected slowdown so hey bryan maybe a little color on the upside bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely i think the scenario that youre laying out there with fewer fed cuts continued strength from an economic perspective thats not a remote scenario in our view we feel like that is something that could very easily happen especially in the first half of the year as we continue to see potentially some strong resiliency from the consumers what that means for us and its a big part of the actions that weve taken thus far is that we think that could cause the long end of the curve to move up a little bit that would actually be beneficial for us as we get an even greater benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing weve talked previously that full year impact of fixed rate asset repricing should generate about million of annualized run rate nii improvement and that number would look even better if we saw that long end move up it also is part of the rationale associated with shifting some of our securities into htm so a stronger economy is one that we would obviously always hope for because were very wellpositioned for that to quote jamie you cant spell flexibility without fitb thats something that we have been very focused on and recognizing that we can be wrong on both sides the economy weaker or stronger and were wellpositioned for that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then another bigger picture question tim i think you touched on your middle market business customers grew yearoveryear and then later in the comments i think you said that you got to take these customers or clients from maybe other banks how are you guys doing that and then if you could tie it fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 into that loan to deposit ratio i think you guys said youre at whats the ideal level that youd eventually like to get to thank you timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp yeah i think its a combination of things gerard the first one is weve been very deliberate to select a few places and invest multiyear when we think about how we invest strategically right so the southeast is obviously a key point of focus there and i know a lot of people are investing in the southeast but it bears reminding that weve been in nearly every one of the markets down there for more than years and were not running small lpos we have more than clientfacing people in those markets across commercial banking and wealth management alone and then like another that sit in more than branches and the brand is seeded in those markets so those investments when you make them you make the investment in year one but they dont actually hit the sort of peak benefit until year five or six so you have this accumulation i guess a coiled spring for lack of a better term that supports then more sustained growth we have the same benefit in the midwest in chicago in particular we added nearly new quality relationships in chicago in the middle market alone last year and have been gaining share pretty steadily if you use the fdic deposit share measures as the guide in chicago because were still seeing the benefits that we got out of the combination between fifth third and mb in those markets the other area that we are winning where we win is through the strength of the treasury management and the capital markets platform which really is a middle market focused offering for fifth third about a third of the new quality relationships we added in treasury management last year were treasury management only so as opposed to being a followon product that you deliver into a customer that youve lent money to theyre actually contributing to the relationship acquisition and thats an engine that just wouldnt have existed here in the past and i think still doesnt exist inside most of our peers gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo of wells fargo securities your line is open timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi you all hey ill ask a question about the quarter then requeue for bigger picture questions but you dont hear too many regionals talking about buybacks like you are right now so but you have a lot of numbers youre fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 tossing out there you have a cet1 minimum by midyear it might be better on the buybacks of million to million depending on the rules so i guess i just want to be a little more concrete so are you sure that you want to be talking about buybacks as much as you are now and what gives you confidence in doing so and then the other side of that is you say if the rules get eased that you might be able to buy back more than the million to million so just give us the kind of the whole range of options if you could bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah mike and what we would tell you on the buybacks and in particular on the rule there appears to be momentum associated with some relief on both the ops risk side and the credit risk rwa as weve continued to refine our estimate from an rwa perspective the rule as proposed is a low singledigit impact from an rwa perspective and almost seven points of rwa is created by the ops risk rule so if that is pared back we could actually see our rwa go down under the new rule which obviously creates a lot of incremental capacity for us as we think about how much capital we need to help run the company from a longterm perspective additionally we have a lot of confidence in the stability of the capital ratios going forward and the pace at which were accreting capital that and combined with the actions that weve taken from a security portfolio perspective to derisk the portfolio with the htm election as well as just the continued benefit that were going to get from roll in on the remaining afs portfolio it just puts us in a position where we are going to have a lot of capital generation and a lot of ability to have flexibility to return capital if the organic growth opportunities arent there timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp yeah and mike i think the one thing i would add to what bryan said is weve tried to be very clear and transparent that our belief is its always better if you have to make a change to adapt to new regulation its better to get there first we did that as it related to consumer deposit fees right we were very deliberate about being early there because we just viewed those profit pools as being unsustainable i think we were clear this past summer and through the fall and winter that our intention on putting ourselves on the rwa diet and focusing as much as we did on building liquidity was that we wanted to get to the rules there first because of the flexibility that it provided so we ended the year at roughly in terms of the cet1 we said we wanted to get to well get there just based on the current run rate in the middle of the second quarter if you had to pick a particular spot and that gives us then the ability to return to share repurchases subject to the environment not changing maybe a little bit earlier than others mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and a short followup so if basel iii gets gutted i guess not a high probability but some have mentioned that recently then your rwas obviously would be flat so you might be better off if they change the ops rule and it passes did i get that right bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah other than if it truly gets gutted and the aoci impact that would be a better option than even if the ops risk rule got gutted so yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 okay thank you bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess two questions one first on trying to make sense of the loantodeposit ratio at relative to fifth thirds history prior to the pandemic and even relative to some of your peers is a loantodeposit ratio the new normal for the bank or trying to understand if theres anything idiosyncratic about the deposit base that requires you to hold and operate with a lower loantodeposit ratio bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp great question i would tell you that is not our longterm target but i would say that our loantodeposit ratio has come down relative to prepandemic levels and a big portion of that is just heightened expectations regarding liquidity so i would expect us to operate in the mid more than likely from a longterm perspective with loan to deposit we were probably mid prepandemic so that is something that we would expect to continue but we do think that we can move up from the current levels ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess a separate question maybe for tim i think you tried to sort of draw some distance between you and some of your peers around the southeast technology investments if we take those statements and account for how do you think this should reflect into should fifth third become a higher growth bank relative to these banks a more efficient bank like what should we be measuring you against and do we start seeing that this year and next year or is this more of a longer term process timothy n spence a chief executive officer president chairman fifth third bancorp yeah great question ebrahim and i think maybe a nuance im less trying to draw a distinction between us and others than i am to say that you cant get what we think we have in terms of the advantages overnight right theyre not advantages that can be built in one to two years they require steady and consistent investment which of course has been the philosophy here along with the belief that you have to find ways to selffund it through efficiency better productivity along the way fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 im hesitant to say fifth third is going to be a growth bank because i think four or five of the people who are described as growth banks failed this past year our belief though is that great companies should be able to take market share on an organic basis so if you assume that the base market growth is somewhere around or at least the financial services sector should be able to track gdp theres a headwind with the emergence of all of these nonbank competitors therefore the more realistic goal from my perspective is to try to beat gdp by a couple of percentage points on an annualized basis which probably means you need to have to outsized growth relative to your market these granular investments were making across the southeast are definitely part of the way that matriculates into performance i think the other place then you should expect to see it given where were investing is continued support for a better fees to total revenue mix which is going to be really critically important in the event that the rules as they are proposed do pass because of the impact that higher capital and liquidity requirements are going to have and youre seeing that today the core fifth third consumer franchise if you just look at household acquisition as a measure is outgrowing midwest population growth by about per year its outgrowing the southeast markets by about percentage points per year so you can see the impact of the incremental investment if you just disaggregate our business and look at it on a marketbymarket basis jamie maybe you want to add something here james c leonard a chief operating officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah ebrahim maybe to tie your two questions together on the loantodeposit ratio part of the improvement has been the strong deposit growth weve been able to get both from the rwa diet which i talked about a couple quarters ago just how customer reaction resulted in more deposits and a better share of wallet and that continued in the fourth quarter commercial deposits you see in the numbers are up nicely and then on the southeast we actually grew deposits in the southeast just in the fourth quarter and so you do get that growth in the numbers but the midwest still grew in total about so weve got a very nice balance here of midwest and southeast and i was down in south carolina on wednesday we opened our 10th branch in south carolina this week and we have plans to do more over the next five years so i think youll continue to see the benefits of the investments over the last three years as we continue to really expand that southeast presence ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc perfect thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of ubs your line is open nicholas holowko q analyst ubs securities llc good morning this is nick holowko on for erika i think in the past youve talked about a curve where the front end is in the low range as an ideal rate environment for the bank is that still the right way to think about it and if we get to that range do you think we could see nim migrate back to the to range you were producing back in the period thank you fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely returning to a normal curve where we would have a say a front end and maybe to basis points of spread between the front end and the 10year rate is a very ideal environment for us because one we are going to get the benefit of deposit repricing lower and at the same time still being able to pick up a lot of benefit associated with that fixedrate asset repricing so being able to achieve a 320plus nim in that kind of scenario a year or two forward would be a something that should be very easily achievable and we feel good about that environment operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi congrats bryan and jamie couple of quick questions for you guys one is in your nii outlook that youve given for the year what are you assuming for deposit betas on the way down sorry if i missed that trying to keep an eye on a bunch of different releases this morning bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp glad you asked the question its the first time its come up actually and it wasnt in our scripted remarks we are expecting betas on the way down to look very similar to what we saw on the last couple of hikes which is in a to range we dont expect a significant difference in betas between the first cut and the third cut theyre still at such a high level that that beta should be relatively high from a marginal perspective our rate risk disclosures we talk about say a to beta on the way down we tend to be a little bit conservative on those disclosures so we think were going to be able to deliver that if not a little bit better vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great another little one other consumer loans the npl has moved up quite a bit linked quarter to around little over any color and is that coming from dividend finance or is that something else james c leonard a chief operating officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah its jamie vivek yeah it is actually from dividend finance and the driver of that theres some element thats just normalization as you go through growing a new company but thats a smaller part of it the larger part of it of the increase is actually from our decision to deliver a good customer experience for the borrowers that have had instances where there are delays in getting the solar panel installations to receive permission to operate from the utilities that could also be delayed due to installer performance issues or supply chain shortages so what weve elected to do is different forms of deferment or modification in order to assist the borrowers and then i would expect this to improve over time as we continue to improve the installer network as well vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so not much lost content youd expect from that jamie then or since its seems like youre deferring rather than fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 james c leonard a chief operating officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp there will be lost content in there it is appropriately reserved so not a income impact but from a solar perspective we continue to run solar losses around or so and as we talked about our deal model was basis points on solar the challenge weve had from a lost content perspective has been on the home improvement side where dividend had a subprime component to their portfolio that has higher losses and we stopped originating that product back over a year ago so therell be some lost content but i dont think you would see it impacting the income vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was wondering if you guys could elaborate a bit on the commercial real estate exposure obviously its a bit less than a few years and as you noted no chargeoffs last year but your nonperformers are also insignificant and even the office criticized is a relatively low compared to others so how is it so good and i guess are you confident that the marks and estimates are uptodate thank you greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah its great question so yes very confident in our marks and where we currently are also very comfortable with the overall asset quality weve been for the last several years very disciplined in terms of our client selection were underwriting commercial real estate specifically office at something below loantovalue weve got recourse on that portfolio and so our borrowers are continuing to exhibit the right behaviors theyre supporting their projects theyre writing checks to reduce the debt as necessary were out ahead of that portfolio the maturities are evenly split over the next four to five years we dont have that socalled wall of maturities that weve heard from some other banks and youve heard in the marketplace so i do feel very good about the overall portfolio our office included matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just more broadly speaking obviously the overall chargeoff outlook for this year is fairly benign to basis points any more color in terms of drivers of call it the midpoint of that range versus levels greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp i think we are going to continue to see a lot of what we saw in what we saw in right we dont have any significant trends geographically or by product and so what we saw in was a little bit more episodic and based on what were seeing on the ci side right now i mean our borrowers have done a nice job both on the executing and the revenue expense management side theres obviously margin compression but overall as tim said earlier theyre looking for the same things were looking for which is what is the fed going to do and when we hear a lot about labor costs so theyre keeping their eye on that so i think were going to have a lot of fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 the same old same old certainly as we get into the first and second quarters in terms of what were seeing both from the lost content in commercial real estate minimal and ci right we will have a name pop up every once in a while well deal with it but again were not seeing trends that would lead me to believe that our criticized assets our overall asset quality is going to move much from where it is right now again as we sit here today heading into the first quarter matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay its helpful thank you operator the next question comes from the line of christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning can you remind us how the commercial ci ddas behaved in a down rate environment and is there any reason to believe that they wouldnt kind of behave positively in your favor this time bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely we would expect ddas to especially the migration to stop migrating into interestbearing and begin growing as rates cuts begin to occur and we talked about that a little bit in the scripted remarks that if we were to see more aggressive cuts wed see some opportunity there weve typically modeled somewhere between million and billion of dda migration per basis points of rate hikes or rate cuts wed expect that to be a fairly similar migration level on up or down just positive or negative we would tell you that probably the beginning cut or two maybe its a little bit slower but if you were to see a much more aggressive path and if the fed funds rate got down into the we would expect a decent reversal christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and that makes sense thank you bryan and then just a quick followup on reserve build would you still build reserves kind of within the current level we have today im just trying to compare the guide of to basis points in the average life of the portfolio is less than four theres really strong coverage im just curious if you would build to that same level bryan preston a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah as long as the economic scenario is similar and the mix of the portfolio obviously is very important in terms of what drives a build certainly dividend some of the things that were talking about from an auto perspective where it can carry a little bit more reserve that has an impact from a build perspective that drives more of the dollar build than anything else at this point christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you for taking my questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected
