retailers merchants and providers later in the call i will provide greater detail on our response to the covid19 outbreak but first let me share with you our results for the first quarter first quarter earnings were million or per diluted share this included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the cecl implementation in january the increase attributable to cecl was million or million after tax which reduced eps by we generated solid growth in several key areas during the quarter on a core basis which excludes walmart and yamaha portfolio loan receivables grew which drove a increase in interest and fees purchase volume increased and average active accounts increased the efficiency ratio was for the quarter we grew deposits over million or over last year and although we slowed the growth of deposits given the excess liquidity from the walmart portfolio sales we did continue to grow lower cost direct deposits at rate over the prior year our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth and we continue to invest in our bank to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers we extended and added partnerships we renewed several key relationships and we added to our growing carecredit network we continue to be excited and are working closely with verizon and venmo to launch these new programs starting while the ultimate launch date for the programs will be dependent on how the current environment develops we anticipate a midyear launch for verizon and a launch in the second half for venmo we continue to remain highly focused on digital innovation accelerating our data analytics capabilities and creating frictionless customer experiences which are key to the success of our programs and winning new relationships driving digital sales penetration is key to our success in retail card digital sales penetration was in the first quarter and digital applications were of our total applications the mobile channel alone grew compared to the same quarter last year excluding walmart during the quarter we repurchased billion of synchrony common stock and paid million or per share in common stock dividend we are pleased with the strength of our business however we did experience a significant reduction in purchase volumes from covid19 in the second half of march which brian will cover later in the call the ultimate impact from this crisis is very difficult to quantify right now with the duration and magnitude still largely unknown however we believe we have an advantageous position to navigate through this uncertain time our portfolio is well positioned from a credit perspective given changes we have made since the great financial crisis in addition to some of the more surgical modifications weve made in recent years further our rsas have historically proven to be an effective buffer during times of stress we have a partner centric business model and are more nimble than

quarter and views on this framework to help consider the impact of covid19 on our key outlook drivers brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks margaret and good morning everyone first let me echo margarets thanks for everyone who is working to keep our community safe and secure from our health care workers first responders to those in grocery stores or working on vaccines the selflessness and dedication of these workers is awe inspiring and deeply appreciated in addition i want to thank our employees around the world who are all adjusting to new ways of working to continue to serve our partners and customers thank you now turning to our financial results for the first quarter ill start on slide of the presentation before i move into the first quarter results i want to cover some of the early trends were seeing from the impact of covid19 from a purchase volume perspective as well as key aspects of our business that are important to highlight given the current environment we are now facing slide shows yearoveryear purchase volume growth for the total company as well as for world sales from our dual and cobranded cards for january february and march march is split between the first half of the month and then the second half where the impact related to covid19 increased significantly purchase volume growth was strong through midmarch with doubledigit growth for both total company and world sales volumes in the second half of march as mandates increased at the federal and state levels travel entertainment and event activity were significantly curtailed and a high number of deemed nonessential retail stores closed as a result purchase volume for both the total company and world sales declined significantly decreasing by and respectively in the second half of march the trends are continuing into april looking at the yearoveryear growth rates of world sales by category during the pretravel restriction period defined as the month of january and then the growth posttravel restriction period through the end of the first synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 quarter we experienced changes in spend categories similar to overall industry trends grocery discount drug store spend increased significantly postjanuary while restaurant entertainment gas and especially travel declined significantly during the same period while restaurant entertainment gas and travel were significantly impacted only of the world sales occurred in these categories obviously these are trends that will impact our purchase volume and loan receivable growth going forward the ultimate impact is still uncertain given the duration and the magnitude of this pandemic is still largely unknown at this point moving to slide we highlight the higher quality asset base today versus our asset base going into the great financial crisis this is a direct result of our strategy to improve asset quality through disciplined underwriting and advances weve made in our underwriting processes that have been very effective in managing overall credit quality id like to highlight various aspects of our credit management program first we have a very experienced credit team and were very disciplined in our approach to underwriting second we control all underwriting and credit decisions in our programs and across our sales platforms our credit strategies are tailored to the partner industry in which we operate and is unique by channel for origination and account management as shown on the left side of the page using fico as a comparative measure of the portfolio has a fico score above compared to in more importantly in the higher loss generating fico range of or lower weve reduced our exposure to of the portfolio compared to in this is a significant improvement of portfolio quality we shifted of the portfolio from balances ator below fico to above fico with a increase in balances with ficos that are or higher as we exited the great financial crisis we made the strategic decision to improve the credit quality of our portfolio and this is reflected in the quality of our new account origination mix since over of the accounts we have originated since are ficos above with of the accounts having fico or higher less than of what we originated had ficos that were or lower we are also using advanced underwriting techniques in managing the portfolio some examples of this are for account acquisition were utilizing up to different data sources and more than attributes to evaluate creditworthiness and to authenticate customer identity we are employing a multialgorithmic approach to target specific outcomes credit fraud synthetic ids and other malicious behavior as well as leveraging client specific data to use customer engagement with our partners to assign more effective credit lines for account management were continuing to utilize internal and credit bureau triggers to dynamically reevaluate a customers creditworthiness to manage credit exposure as well as leveraging the latest technology to passively authenticate customers and more selectively target high risk behavior this is evident in the improved purchase volume mix from the time we deployed these underwriting techniques in the chart on the righthand side of the page shows the improvement of the purchase volume mix from first quarter which shows of the purchase volume mix being at a 721plus fico for the first quarter compared to in the first quarter of finally it should be noted that our portfolio is well diversified by industry and weve been growing payment solutions and carecredit portfolios at a faster rate than retail card and we dont have any significant geographic concentrations synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 in summary we have substantially improved the asset quality of our portfolio compared to the portfolio we had during the great financial crisis we have developed better tools and capabilities and can deploy underwriting changes more quickly and with greater efficacy than ever before slide shows you a longerterm view of how we perform from a loss perspective dating back to the great financial crisis when loss rate for card issuers peaked in the general perception is that private labeled credit cards will perform slightly worse than general purpose cards in periods of higher credit losses but you can see in the top chart that our credit performance was relatively in line with general purpose card issuers in the to loss range in on a managed basis one of the keys to the loss experience being similar is that the severity of loss is lower for us due to the average balance being generally lower than general purpose cards for the first quarter the average balance per active account was which is flat to last year if you look at this on a riskadjusted yield basis we outperformed the general purpose card peers by a wide margin through the crisis with a riskadjusted yield running over basis points higher than the peer group as we move beyond the cycle and losses have declined our riskadjusted yield outperformance compared to general purpose card issuers has remained over basis points post crisis rsas also provide a buffer this was evident in and again beginning through as credit costs increased as shown in the chart in the lower righthand corner of slide while the driver of the countercyclical nature of rsas are creditrelated other factors also impact the rsas such as program revenue expenses and mix in rsas as a percentage of average receivables declined to below the more normalized rsa average of for through the strong riskadjusted yield and countercyclical nature of rsas were important elements in our ability to remain profitable through the great financial crisis as both highlight the earnings resiliency of our business model the company generated around a return on assets at the height of the crisis in given the items ive highlighted earlier while were not expecting a level of chargeoffs resulting from the current situation to be similar to the great financial crisis we felt it was important to give you some historical context on the key elements that sets our business apart from others in the industry moving to the first quarter financial results on slide this morning we reported first quarter earnings of million or per diluted share this included an increase in the provision for credit losses as a result of the implementation of cecl in january the increase was million or million after tax which reduced eps by we generated solid yearoveryear growth in several areas as noted on slide on a core basis which excludes the walmart and yamaha portfolios loan receivables were up and interest and fees on loan receivables were up driven by growth in receivables on a core basis purchase volume was and average active accounts increased over last year on slide weve included dual and cobranded card purchase volumes and loan receivable balances to provide the level of diversification we have to these products dual and cobranded cards account for of total purchase volume in the first quarter and grew over prior year they accounted for of the total loan receivables portfolio and grew over the prior year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 overall were pleased with the underlying growth we generated across the business as i noted earlier the impact of covid19 accelerated as we moved through the quarter with most of the impact occurring late in the quarter we are expecting a more substantial impact this quarter but given the duration and the magnitude is still largely unknown at this point its difficult to provide a more precise forecast of the impact rsa decreased million or from last year rsas as a percentage of average receivables were for the quarter at the lower end of the range we expected in the first quarter due to higher credit loss reserve build the provision for credit losses increased million or from last year the increase was primarily driven by the walmart credit loss reserve reduction last year that totaled million a higher reserve build in the first quarter partially offset by lower net chargeoffs accounted for the remaining increase the reserve build in the first quarter was million and largely due to the projected impact of covid19related losses other income increased million other expense was down million or due to cost reductions from walmart partially offset by higher operational losses and expenses related to the covid19 response so overall the company continue to generate solid results in the first quarter outside of the impacts from covid19 i will take a moment to highlight our platform results on slide in retail card core loan receivable growth was the solid growth driven primarily by our digital partners other metrics were down driven by the sale of the walmart portfolio payment solutions delivered a strong quarter with broadbased growth across the sales platform and strength in home furnishings and home specialty that resulted in core loan receivable growth of interest and fees on loans increased primarily driven by the loan receivable growth purchase volume and average active accounts increased we signed a number of new partners and renewed key partnerships this quarter we continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and card networks these networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse which now stands at approximately of purchase volume excluding oil and gas that helps us to drive solid results carecredit also delivered another strong quarter receivable growth of was led by our dental and veterinary specialties interest and fees on loans increased primarily driven by the loan receivable growth purchase volume was up and average active accounts increased we continue to expand our network and the utility of our card as weve added over new provider locations to our network during the quarter the network expansion has helped to drive the reuse rate to of purchase volume in the first quarter we did start to see the effects of covid19 on the platform results as the quarter progressed in retail card while store closing impacted results we also saw a strong growth in digital purchase volume that helped offset some of the covid19 impact in payment solutions while store closings had a less pronounced impact promotional offerings and the growth in areas such as home specialty helped mitigate some of this impact for carecredit we continue to see good performance in areas such as veterinary partially offset by reductions in elective procedures we do expect the effects will carry into the next quarter and be more pronounced as many of the store closings occurred during the latter part of march ill move to slide and cover our net interest income and margin trends net interest income decreased from last year primarily driven by a decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the walmart portfolio on a core basis interest and fees on loans increased the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 the main factors driving the margin performance were a decline in loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets the mix declined from to driven by higher liquidity during the quarter that mainly resulted from the proceeds of the walmart portfolio sale in october of last year a basis point decrease in loan receivables yield to primarily driven by the sale of the walmart portfolio partially offset by a basis point decrease in total interestbearing liabilities cost at primarily driven by lower benchmark rates next ill cover our key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter ill start with the delinquency trends the 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and the 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year if you exclude the impact of the walmart portfolio the 30plus delinquency rate was down approximately basis points and the 90plus delinquency rate was down approximately basis points compared to last year focusing on net chargeoff trends the net chargeoff rate was compared to last year the reduction in net chargeoff rate was primarily driven by walmart and improving credit trends excluding the impact of the walmart portfolio net chargeoff rate was approximately basis points lower than last year this was better than expectation around a basis point increase from the fourth quarter net chargeoff rate of the allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was postcecl implementation which included a billion day one transition adjustment excluding the effects of cecl the allowance under the alll method would have been the reserve build in the first quarter was million under cecl and million under the alll method the overall reserve provisioning was higher than expected due to the impact of covid19 which accounted for most of the reserve build in the first quarter in summary the first quarter credit trends were slightly better than our expectations excluding the covid19 impact we expect credit trends will be impacted by this as we move forward the extent of the impact is difficult to assess at this point given the uncertainty around the duration and the magnitude of the pandemic as well as the potential effects from the cares act and our own efforts providing relief to cardholders impacted by covid moving to slide ill cover expenses for the quarter overall expenses came in at billion down million or from last year the decline was driven by cost reductions from walmart this was partially offset by higher expenses attributable to operational losses and certain expenditures related to our response to covid19 the efficiency ratio for the quarter was versus last year excluding the impact from operational losses and the covid19related expenses the efficiency ratio was flat compared to the prior year moving to slide over the last year weve grown our deposits over million or this puts deposits at of our funding compared to last year while we slowed the overall deposit growth in the first quarter given the excess liquidity for the walmart portfolio sale in the fourth quarter of last year we did continue to grow our lower cost direct deposits at a slightly higher pace over the prior year total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to over of our total assets this is up from last year before i provide detail on our capital liquidity position it should be noted that were electing to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in march which had two primary benefits first it delays the effects of the transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second allows for a portion of the current period provisioning under cecl to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 with this framework we ended the first quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules near the same level as last year tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year reflecting the preferred stock issuance last november the total capital ratio increased basis points as well to also reflecting the preferred issuance and the tier capital ratio plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to a basis point increase over the prior year reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing cecl and the preferred stock issuance during the quarter we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced last may we paid a common stock dividend of per share and repurchased billion or million shares of common stock during the first quarter at the end of the first quarter we had million of remaining share repurchase capacity of the billion authorized plan for the current capital plan cycle given the current economic uncertainty and being as prudent as possible weve made the decision to halt further share repurchases under this plan to have greater visibility of the depth and magnitude of the current environment overall we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously were committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and operating with strong capital and liquidity levels in closing we normally provide updates to our outlook given the number of uncertainties that exist regarding the severity and the duration of the covid19 pandemic and the countering impacts of actions such as the cares act payment assistance for our customers and other government and regulatory actions that may have its very difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this time as a result our expectations have changed versus the outlook we provided in january and that guidance should no longer be relied upon since the duration and magnitude of the current environment is uncertain we cant provide any ranges around the key outlook drivers for but i want to provide a framework to help consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers regarding loan receivable growth covid19 has significant impact on the purchase volume particularly late in the first quarter we anticipate continued deterioration of purchase volume on a yearoveryear basis until the situation improves presumably later this year what may help mitigate some of this impact is growth in digital and were well positioned for this through our digital partners as well as leveraging our expertise to help other partners and providers the overall net deterioration of purchase volume will ultimately impact our receivable growth rate when considering net interest margin we will be impacted by the reduction in prime rates resulting from the fed rate cuts a reduction in investment income from our liquidity portfolio as well as the potential impact of forbearance in terms of interest and fee waivers for a temporary period of time partially offsetting the margin compression is the expected higher interest income generated from an increase in the number of accounts that are involved in the loan receivable portfolio and lower interest expense as benchmark rates are lower finally it should be noted we also share the impact of revenues and funding costs through the rsa regarding rsas in addition to sharing the net interest income impacts well also see a more pronounced impact from higher credit costs as we move through the year also as we noted in january the impact of cecl on rsas will be more fully realized in the second half of the year while we expect an increase in net chargeoff rate as the year progresses it should be noted the overall portfolio quality and credit trends as we entered this pandemic are synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 strong and the tools and capabilities that we have are more advanced than in the great financial crisis which were highlighted earlier in the call finally we also believe higher recoveries will ultimately materialize partially mitigating the impact of higher losses similar to revenue we also showed the impact of higher credit costs through the rsa while we expect the reserve builds to be higher than original expectations until we gain more visibility into the duration of severity of the current pandemic we cannot provide more specific guidance once we have greater visibility well be in a better position to define the expected chargeoff and reserve build expectations going forward regarding the efficiency ratio activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels and we will look to mitigate some of this impact through expense reduction opportunities we will continue to assess the situation and provide guidance when we have greater visibility into the effects of the current environment fundamentally the business remains strong and is resilient and we go into this situation with a strong balance sheet capital and liquidity position with that ill turn the call back over to margaret margaret m keane chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian ill provide a quick wrap up and then well open the call to qa we continue to believe that the strength in our business model and the resiliency of our associates will help us navigate this global health crisis we are focused on continuing to execute for our retailers merchants and providers and support

deliver the products and services our customers will expect beyond this period thank you for participating on the call today and i want to wish you and your families all the very best as we continue to deal with this very difficult situation ill now turn the call back to greg to open up the qa greg wade ketron senior vice president managing director of investor relations synchrony financial that concludes our comments on the quarter we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks very much for the comments in the call brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc im just wondering brian you guys cited volumes and sales down about in the second half of march just trying to think about modeling for the nearterm quarters is that the type of contraction youre seeing thus far through april and how do we think about kind of what youve seen thus far in april brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks john and good morning from the back half of march which was down again about it accelerated slightly so were running in the range of down to pretty consistently for the first part of april again when you think about the world spend categories we highlighted in the earnings chart theyre very similar with regard to being down in travel gas and entertainment a little stronger in grocery drug store et cetera but again thats just on the dual card but the strength of the digital assets we do have some retailers that are deemed essential that are open and clearly the digital and ecommerce is continuing to drive it so its pretty steady in that low decline yearoveryear john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks thats very helpful and second question just trying to think about the context of this versus the great recession where i guess what in your economic models that have driven the allowance levels what level of kind of unemployment are you contemplating at this point in time or how do we think about the economic assumptions relative to the period brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure john so let me kind of go through how we think about or how we thought about this quarter in building the acl reserve as you know the economic assumptions vary pretty widely across many of the institutions that provide that we dont come up with our own assumptions we use external assumptions so given the variation synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 that we saw across many institutions we modeled several different scenarios and looked at several different scenarios in how they would perform relative to our book and then we settled in on a set of assumptions from one place that really looked at an unemployment rate approaching for the second quarter as kind of the peak and then a second half recovery where unemployment goes down to around and then a very kind of more gradual decline in and gets back to probably about a unemployment as you think about it in with that bankruptcy is rising about and staying elevated for the next couple of years was also a very key assumption in that and then a significant contraction in gdp for the second quarter again with a second half recovery but obviously being down for the full year so thats kind of how we thought about it now when you take that and go back to the great financial crisis very very different set of scenarios where you had a consumer that was stressed you had unemployment lag you did not have the timing and the amount of the stimulus coming through to the consumer so its a pretty different scenario to try to compare back to it and then if you really go back and look at the portfolio john the portfolio is fundamentally different obviously walmarts gone the amount of assets that we have above has shifted significantly the amount of and the amount weve invested in our advanced underwriting the tools and technology is very very different so we feel comfortable as we kind of sit here today that the portfolio is in a very good credit quality up until mid march we actually saw our credit quality improving or continuing to improve yearoveryear which was positive to us so the consumer came in ph in great strength we have this kind of economic situation really coming out of the pandemic and then we have a ton of stimulus flowing through so very very different from our perspective john hecht q analyst jefferies llc that detail is very helpful thanks very much guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day operator we have our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great i was hoping that you could kind of just give a little bit of a little more kind of detail around what you would like to achieve with the deferments and how its going to work like any kind of granularity about what people are asking for what are you giving and what do you see as the percentage of the portfolio thats likely to be in that bucket at some future points say into the second quarter brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure good morning moshe so let me break down the forbearance that were providing to our customers so the first thing that were doing is if a customer calls in and have been impacted if theyre asking for a waiver of a late fee or interest charges we are waiving those for qualifying accounts we also will waive the min payment so weve actually deferred the min payment on the account for up to three months and kind of hold them in their synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 due stage if youre current bring them back if youre ph too due to current so really give them the opportunity to kind of get their situation a little bit more in order we also in the promotional book are extending for periods up to days the deferral of the expiration of the promo so those are the primary forms of relief that were providing to those people so if you look at how many people have taken advantage of that for us its about accounts todate and about billion in balances so if you think about it a small percentage yet have taken advantage of the program and we have not seen a tremendous amount of people needing that min pay deferral at this point but again well continue to offer that to help our cardholders through this time moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you thanks for that and maybe just can you talk a little bit either brian you or margaret about just the discussions youre having with your retail partners now and what it is theyre asking from you and what are you asking from them margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so id say right out of the gate probably the biggest thing was really stabilization of the operation obviously one of the things we worked hard to do which was pretty miraculous actually was to get our employees all work from home including our call center so were pretty close to work at home right now so from a servicing level were meeting and making sure were exceeding the service levels for our customers and i think that was really important we kind of have a mixed bag here because we have retailers who are opening and servicing customers we have very big online partners who are servicing their customers and then we have retailers who have actually closed so i would say all our teams are highly focused on both our retail partners and our providers having the relationship managers connecting with them obviously theyre they want to make sure that were reacting in the right way for their end consumer and doing the right things both from a forbearance perspective but also from a credit perspective and were in daily dialogues with them i would say we feel pretty good about where we are we got a pretty nice note from one of our partners who was really thrilled to see how weve been able to service their customers through this so highly engaged were not sitting back were having those conversations and making sure that we have clear dialogue all along the way moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks and best of luck brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator we have our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning brian i was wondering if you could talk a little bit you had mentioned the unemployment assumption you have is around i assume thats higher in april can you sort of flesh that out and if you look at your allowance at around i would assume that needs to go higher can you talk about the reserve build lets say in q2 versus q1 that would be helpful thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thank you don so as you think about it really under the cecl methodology and acl we obviously use a set of assumptions at the point in time which we make the estimate for the reserve as we stepped into april again theres a pretty wide disparity among people with regard to peak unemployment that will happen in the second quarter but again a lot of it one of the most important parts is what does the recovery period look like and from that peak as you move down how quickly does it move down and how does it move down so most certainly the development of the retail landscape the development of how the consumer and the stimulus bridges people through this period of time is going to be critical if you kind of follow through and say yes there is a deterioration in the assumptions on the unemployment peak in that recovery period and the effects of the stimulus then there would be higher reserve post coming in the second quarter but were only days into the quarter at this point don so i really cant give you with clarity the exact reserve post we would see we need to see how those assumptions really develop here in the second quarter as we move through it again that recovery period and the effects of the stimulus are really important attributes donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator and we have our next question from ryan cary with bank of america ryan cary q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i hope you are all well and thank you for taking my question given all the moving pieces i hope you can provide a little more insight into how youre seeing the pace of chargeoffs ramping while i understand determining the magnitude itself is hard to predict with the forbearance plans and government support programs all is equal is it fair to assume that chargeoffs will be pushed out further than they would otherwise and how are you thinking about potential impact assuming unemployment is elevated for a couple of quarters versus a couple of months synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning ryan and thank you for your wishes so as we think about it today obviously the forbearance which isnt hasnt been that much for us could delay potential net chargeoffs again i think the stimulus package will help bridge some consumers here for a period of time we would begin to expect that you would see chargeoffs really begin to elevate in the latter part of the third quarter probably the fourth quarter and into again the magnitude of that we think weve covered in our acl reserve here at the end of the first quarter but the timing of thats really going to depend again on this peak and how the recovery begins to come out as we develop here in the second quarter to be honest with you ryan cary q analyst bofa securities inc okay and i was hoping you could spend some time on the discussions youre having with retailers around signing new programs or renewing partnerships i know you called out a couple during the quarter but how does the current environment impact the prospect pipeline and can you discuss the impact of the pace of new business deals both in and beyond margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah believe it or not there are deals in the pipeline and we are having conversations and we are bidding on deals i would say things conversations maybe have slowed a little bit just as people have been trying to deal with all the challenges facing but we feel pretty good about the pipeline thats there weve been able to be i think and going to be very discriminatory on the things we do look at to make sure they fit where we want to go with the business but i would say in all three platforms weve had good activity and well i think continue to have that good activity well have to see as the rest of the year progresses but right now we do have a decent pipeline brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah what id add ryan to that is as we think about these relationships and margaret really highlighted when you target them when we go to think about the economics with them clearly weve always priced through a deterioration economic with them and whenever you think about a 7year deal or a 10year deal we as an enterprise think about through the cycle clearly as we would look at this scenario the cycle is at the beginning of that potential relationship and the depth of it so we are probably a little bit more conservative and really well do that deal only if it meets a what we view as a riskadjusted return that we think is conservative at this point ryan cary q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you for taking my questions synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan have a good day operator we have our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions first on the rsa i think brian you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the rsa impact will related to cecl day would be coming in the back half of the year maybe you could just give us some of the puts and takes there and degree of magnitude that youre looking for brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thank you and good morning so as you think about it and the worlds kind of changed from january a little bit first i just want to make sure that betsy that we have a perspective on the reserve provision for the quarter and the difference between cecl and the alll if you think about the total reserve build for the quarter being million million im sorry million of that is really related to covid19 and million so less than our expectations as we entered the quarter kind of came from the core book which really reflected the higher credit quality that we experienced in the vast majority of the quarter as you think about it the whole million is cecl so we highlighted if we did alll itd be million if we did cecl its million but as you think about the million that ultimately is whats going to pass through to the extent that is subject to the rsa will pass through the rsa so we would expect what i would say a sequential dollar lowering dollars of the rsa as we step through the year and obviously as a percent of alr so you will see that into the second quarter and then really more into the second half of the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and so that is the reason its moving into the second half is a function of the revenue recognition on the part of your retailer clients im assuming synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial no betsy its as we implemented cecl and through the rsas again we did not change the economic sharing its just really the mechanics of how it passed from us through the rsa and that just had a slight lag to it so there is no difference as you think about through the rsa in whether its cecl or alll the reserve itself just comes on a slight lag so youll begin to feel that more in the second half and its more than just the mechanics of how it works through the program agreements with our retail partners and then their revenue recognition or some other type of change in the economics it just was more mechanics on how it works in the program agreement but again we expect a sequential benefit as we move throughout the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right got it and then just the followup question margaret for you is given the changes that weve had here over the last couple of months how are you thinking about opportunities to either expand your functionality or what you can deliver to your retail partners or your carecredit partners im just wondering if there is opportunities for picking up technology or other types of systems or functionality that could enhance your offerings margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah id say two things one even before the pandemic we were starting to get a little bit of opportunities out there that were starting to perk our interest weve kept those warm i think right now you got to really wait to see how valuations play out so were not going to jump into anything too quickly but there are things that are out there that are certainly of interest to us on the second piece i think the other thing that weve done is we have actually we looked at our strategic initiatives for and have realigned our teams a little bit to focus and accelerate some of the digital things that we were working on or planning to do weve stopped some things that we think we can hold off till and took those agile teams and are putting them against more digital capability for the company and i think thats going to help us as we come out of the or go through this and we give our partners and the end consumers more digital capability obviously were certainly winning on the digital side in terms of our online penetration and our volume coming through there so we know this is a really critical thing so even not only the opportunities externally but i think we have and have already started the teams and kicked it off and driving it forward i dont know brian doubles if youd add anything there brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah no the only thing maybe i would add as margaret said we did move very quickly and we actually went through every strategic project in the business and there were things that were obvious things that our partners were asking us to accelerate for them to help them get through this difficult time so we redeployed agile in there and then there were some things that we did around special promotions for some of our partners that still have stores open and are still very active online and then as margaret said some things that we paused were just things that in this environment didnt make sense so we had some card reissues dual card upgrades things synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 like that that we repositioned or delayed and moved to kind of the back half of the year when things become a little more stable betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great thanks betsy operator our next question is from david scharf with jmp securities david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc hi good morning and thanks for taking my question and thanks for providing as much color as i guess recently can be expected given all the circumstances hey wanted to followup just quickly on the previous question on the forbearance the relatively modest number of accounts and balances you highlighted im just curious have most people been through a billing cycle i mean in the sense that you get a sense that theyre aware of what potential relief is available to them just trying to get a sense for how we should think about the number of accounts and balances that ultimately may be a month from now take advantage of these policies brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great thanks for the question so we have used our assets our digital assets social media channels et cetera to get out to our cardholders the benefits that are available for them if theyve been impacted by covid so we have this outreach program well certainly we are still taking a large number of calls through our call center so we are talking to the consumers about ph well if they need it part of it when you think about the dollars different than some of our other peers our average balance is much smaller than theirs given the percentage of private label but again even our retail dual cards are more low in growth strategy so again of the balance is we think is pretty reasonable but everyone has been through a billing cycle and again i think part of it is as they go through this we put this plan in place in i think on march we will begin to see the effects i mean obviously certain people have had continued to work for a period of time or maybe on a furlough plan but they may be just starting to realize that they need assistance and well continue to provide that assistance as we move forward so that number will grow but again were using our assets to make sure that customers who do need forbearance were helping them david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc got it got it and just a followup on the retail partner side and i appreciate the color on purchase volume trends in april to date ignoring for the moment the fact that digital is somewhat of a mitigating factor im wondering just synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 within retail card and within well actually all three product segments are you able to provide sort of a percentage of the number of partners that are physically closed obviously youve benefited from having exposure to discount clubs home improvement places that are staying open deemed to be essential services and just trying to get a little bit of a indiscernible margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah weve been monitoring that but i would say most on the retail card side while they may be actually closed they all have some digital presence so thats a little bit of what were seeing it gets a little more complicated on the payment solutions side where we have over close to merchants to really know which one of them are actually closed fully or doing some online obviously there are certain things that i think some of our partners dont have online capability and then obviously in carecredit really what were seeing there is two things emergency dental is still happening emergency vet is still happening believe it or not weve seen a little spike for all of you who have young kids out there weve seen a little spike in orthopedics so people are hurting themselves while theyre homing on their bikes and things like that so its a little hard to give you a number i would say what were trying to do is wherever theres a digital capability were very focused with those partners to make sure were delivering and it also varies by region as you know we have some states that are still open where the stores are open so a little hard to give you a percentage or a number because its such a mix david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc got it appreciate it thank you very much operator and thank you our next question is from vincent caintic with stephens vincent caintic q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning thanks so much for taking my question just two quick ones so understanding your thinking about the purchase volume decline so maybe assets start to shrink on the funding side of that how are you thinking about deposits and pricing deposits i guess im thinking how low are you willing to price deposits to rightsize in the case of an asset ph surge brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question vincent so the way we think about the funding side of the stack clearly in the economic environment that were in our view is using the unsecured or secured market is not as costeffective so deposits for us which are at of the debt stack at the end of the first quarter well continue to grow that probably as a percent of the overall funding stack so look to lean a little bit more there for us its going to be we have a couple of primary competitors in that market and we look to stay competitive there so this way we dont have to invest as much in marketing and things like that so on a rate basis we actually have moved down this year with regard to high yield savings were down basis points on the high yield savings synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 we were also down at least on our certificate of deposit movements on top of what we already moved down in so well continue to evaluate that market but that would be one of our primary sources relative to that so our view is hopefully well be able to trend that down or continue to trend that down throughout vincent caintic q analyst stephens inc okay thank you and a followup quick followup question on rsas when i look on slide of your deck and see the say the net chargeoff ratio was in and your rsas were is that still an appropriate correlation is there any way to think about that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah clearly what id tell you vincent is the rsas will move and provide that countercyclical buffer so as chargeoffs do come through you will see a reduction in the rsa percentages the exact correlation of the percent to the chargeoff rate again as i indicated earlier on this call the fact that we dont have walmart the fact that you have a very different economic scenario between the great financial crisis and now i dont want to draw the direct correlation but you will see a similar shape to that curve when the benefit as it comes through vincent caintic q analyst stephens inc great thanks very much and be safe brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you sir operator our next question is from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc thanks so much for taking my question i really do also appreciate all the detail you provided when you think about the reserve builds from cecl versus growth or for growth versus changes in your unemployment expectations given the reduction in yearoveryear purchase volume and the potential contraction of the loan book wouldnt that provide a cushion as far as reserve releases and create some really big quarteroverquarter variability so do you think about how do you think about those two pieces and do you think about them over the full year instead of quartertoquarter and it looks like to me that perhaps the reserve build could be basically zero given the for the full year given the reduction possibility in the actual loans brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the first thing first thank you for your question i think we have to be a little bit careful here on data points right we gave you a snapshot to try to be transparent about what happened between march and synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 march on purchase volume being down and then for the first couple of weeks of april being down around to whats really unclear is when the mandates lift right and retail comes back online what that retail landscape will look like and the shape of that curve so im not necessarily sure if i were you i would be thinking about were going to have a decline in retail purchase volume or purchase volume for the company for the remainder of the year so thats number one number two you also have to remember in this period of time when youre going through an economic environment that we are you are going to see the payment rate decline so youll see an upward bias in theory on the asset rate so you have those two things moving against each other it will then really look to what for us from a reserving perspective will be as we think about the portfolio at that point in time what is the economic assumption so im not necessarily sure id say okay your portfolio is going to decline and therefore youll be at zero there are several factors that are moving in different directions inside of that again if you see deterioration in the macroeconomic assumptions that weve used for march you do see retail come back online then i do believe youre going to see provisions for credit losses as we move forward dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks i appreciate the clarification there and then your consumer installment loan yields actually had a nice little jump what do you think the trajectory on those yields are over is that because of kind of the expectation for added risk and so you upped the yield or what are you thinking on the goforward trajectory there is that sustainable brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial that is really being driven by the disposition of yamaha in the first quarter dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc okay great thanks so much i really appreciate it thank you greg wade ketron a senior vice president managing director of investor relations synchrony financial hey vanessa we have time for one more question operator and thank you our last question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning and i hope you guys are staying healthy and safe i guess margaret you mentioned the venmo and the verizon product launches are on track when we think and you mentioned theyre sort of subject to the evolving macro landscape i guess when we think about any commitments you had made to grow the portfolio so how should we think about that synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 and then maybe ill just ask my second question related to that as we think about some of the investment spend that you had that you guys were embarking on and other broad investment spends how can we think about the flexibility of those expenses in this backdrop thanks margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial sure so let me answer the first one so clearly we were really excited when we won both verizon and venmo and those are two i think very strategic programs for us as we continue to really build out our digital capabilities so those agile teams that have been focused on the launch of those two programs are full speed ahead and we havent reduced any focus if anything were even maybe accelerating some things there so were really excited about being able to launch them obviously the launches will be dependent upon the environment we believe midyear for verizon and the second half for venmo so excited about those and the teams are really working hard in terms of the other investments its a little bit of what brian doubles said we actually took a step back and let me step back even one step further what we did as a leadership team i mean despite all the negative things that are happening around pandemic theres also opportunities right and so what we really tried to do is step back and say how do we take part of our leadership team to focus on the operation and get the operation stabilized we have another group that are working on what do we look like coming out of this and how quick do we come out and what are the initiatives we have to have in place to come out and then three what are the longterm opportunities and implications for the company and so weve kind of organized ourselves that way and we have seven work streams that brian is leading to really kind of set us up for the future so brian i dont know if you want to comment a little more on our flexibility in some of the things weve been doing brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah no i think thats right so we went as i said earlier through every strategic project in the business we kind of looked at that through the lens of the current realities that were facing and we said okay some of these things we need to move faster on based on what our partners are trying to achieve as they go through the crisis and then some things frankly just dont make sense to do right now were going to push those out delay pause et cetera and then some things well just continue and verizon and venmo are examples of things that well continue as margaret said a little bit uncertain but then we also said okay we need to be thinking beyond we need to be thinking coming out of this how can we best position ourselves for the future and we said look there are we came up with seven or eight different work streams that are really all encompassing and we said forget about whether this is a v or u shape we know that every aspect of our business is going to change in some degree coming out of this so our customers are going to use our products differently we know that theyre going to shop differently theyre going to spend differently theyre going to pay differently we know our partners are going to come out of this looking differently and theyll have different strategies that we need to flex to and we know that the way that we work together as a team is going to change as well synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 and so we looked in really those three broad buckets and we said okay we need to have a really good strategic plan and a vision around each one of those so that we emerge from this as strong as possible and i think as we kind of move through that work well obviously share more in the future sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and i guess just to followup on that is the conclusion that the cost base might not need to be realigned a little bit lower given some of the challenges your retailers might have margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial no brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial no margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial we will definitely have to realign our cost base i think we just we are trying to see what this we want to get a little more feeling for how this comes out but one thing that we and we just we did that with the departure of walmart we know how to adjust the cost base weve froze jobs so were not hiring anybody right now weve done all those kinds of actions already out of the gate obviously were saving on some other things like travel and things like that but we if we have to reset the cost base of the business as we come out of this because were smaller we will do that and we have our eye on that ball thats a little bit of some of the work streams brian even has on his list so brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sanjay this is brian wenzel let me just kind of put a bow out where you started right so your first question on verizon and venmo the timing really hasnt shifted that much when you think about the costs associated with those two and i know we highlighted to be a share for the year the marketing research cost the launch cost the development cost to develop all the inapp capabilities for lets say venmo that also has to occur right the shifting of the programs and the reserves which was a component of that cost isnt that significant now as margaret said well see how the current environment and whether or not there is a more material shift in that and well obviously provide transparency as we get to our call in july so with regard to we started there isnt really a change from i think the guidance that we provided earlier in the year second just to highlight what margaret said obviously the development of the retail landscape the development of the consumer once we have more transparency to that obviously well look to maintain the same type of efficiency and well work through that as obviously there are large portions that are variable but obviously we maybe take action on the fixed cost part of the business in order to rightsize it so thats how i would think about it synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats perfect im sorry one last question because im being asked this question quite a bit capital ratios dividend sustainability sort of how are you guys thinking about it obviously brian wenzel you talked about the balance sheet shrinking how should we think about capital freed up to the extent that were even to occur does that qualify as sort of excess capital and therefore it provides a cushion or maybe you could just walk us through the discussions youre having with regulators thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes sure so with the capital position capital is something that weve come out from our separation from ge as a strength we came out with a higher capital ratio a cet1 capital ratio than we probably needed but we need to demonstrate our ability to stand up as a separate public company and withstand events like this so our ultimate goal was really to migrate our capital ratios down to that of our peers that has not changed through this we feel as we start into this economic period that we have a significant amount of capital to weather the storm obviously the cecl transition helps as well but well continue to migrate that capital down to peer levels over time with regard to your second question around the dividend obviously the dividend is important to us as we think about the business and really the ppnr and resiliency of the business we believe that we can continue to generate capital as we think about our priorities for the use of capital its really the growth of our existing programs number one the second really is the dividend and as we sit here today we believe were going to continue to pay that dividend based upon the current environment and based upon our forecast that we have the financial strength to capital and liquidity to continue to do that and thats a high priority for us and then as you move through obviously then it would be share repurchases and then down the road whether its portfolio acquisitions or ma but from a dividend perspective again given the current environment and our assessment were committed to pay that dividend sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay margaret m keane a
