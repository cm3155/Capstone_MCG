strategic plan update and forecast call as we go through this transition year in we will continue to provide updates about the company including forecast we feel its important for our investors to be informed and along for the journey as we build a strong performing bank when we met last may craig and i had been in our positions for roughly four weeks now that weve had an additional days we feel we understand the company and have put it on a path to success we have a firm hand on the steering wheel of the company and excited to be in the position that we are today this has been a very busy quarter for us and we feel like weve accomplished a lot of great things in addition to our second quarter results earlier this morning we announced a significant transaction the sale of our mortgage servicing businesses and thirdparty origination platform to mr cooper one of the countrys leading mortgage companies we have also had a strong relationship with mr cooper both from a banking relationship and knowing a number of the personnel so we do view this will be a good and easy transition of our important assets into the company this comes on top of our announcement on monday that we closed on the sale of our mortgage warehouse loans to jpmorgan chase we discussed that at our last earnings call did not identify that transaction by name but that has now closed we received billion of liquidity on monday theres roughly million that should close over the next days both of these sales are important milestones for us as we look to simplify our business model and strengthen our balance sheet and as we will highlight later collectively these two transactions we feel bolster our liquidity and increase our capital ratios new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 last quarter we laid out the strategic initiatives for the company this quarter i want to update you on the status of those initiatives starting with slide you can see we have made significant progress during our transition year on each of the five strategies outlined on page under the first we conducted and completed our board transformation im happy to report i think we have one of the strongest boards in the industry today ive had the opportunity over the last days to observe them in action they are an active board they challenge management and they have established a very high standard for performance and execution and i think thats one of the hallmarks of any great organization is a very complete and solid board in addition to that during the quarter we added nine additional senior executives to our executive and leadership team this brings to the total of new executives to date to the organization ill remind people on the call we did this within a fivemonth period and ill talk a little bit more on slide when we get to about the level of that talent as far as our ongoing execution of our operating plan we had very strong deposit growth during the quarter our deposits grew it was a very solid result both in our private banking and our retail banking franchise as we commented we diversified and are strengthening our balance sheet we exited two noncore businesses as i described and we feel we are on track to meet the expense targets in our forecast which will be over million of net cost takeouts while we continue to build our risk infrastructure and our ci platform as we move forward on item number achievable capitals and earnings forecast the strategic sales will add about basis points to our cet ratio we pro forma this at a cet of which we feel is at and above our peers and we also had an incremental improvement in nim and nii to loan portfolio pricing in the future and the increases to our ci business on the improved funding profile our pro forma liquidity post the transactions will be roughly billion this results in over coverage ratio to our uninsured deposits and the transactions provide a net about billion of liquidity to the organization through divestitures and deposit growth as we talked about in the call in may theres been a lot of focus on the credit risk management in the company we now are through roughly of our cre portfolio that was roughly in the first quarter we continue to address problem loans through additional chargeoffs and our acl build up to and were very focused on the remediation of problem loans and ill add some comments to that on a couple of slides later and then we also have begun to add talent and resources in this area we hired a new head of our workout group during the quarter which is one of the talented people we feel in the industry moving on to slide you can see on slide there are key takeaways for the quarter which we think were really solid as i commented we have meaningful enhancements in liquidity and capital we grew our deposits in key areas of key focus which includes our retail and private bank since we had a chance to discuss ph that ive done a fair amount of branch visits we visited branches in arizona michigan and florida weve rebranded all of the branches between november and march we have a very consistent theme to colors and messaging in the branches and i was very impressed with our branch personnel with their outward mobility seeking customers and a very focused goals and objectives i think not only are we seeing as we commented on strong deposit growth but were also seeing very strong referrals to our investment activities as well we had meaningful cre payoffs as we commented before one of the strategic goals of the company is to shrink our cre exposure to roughly billion and we have a longterm goal to get that into the billion to billion level to give us diversification on the balance sheet as craig will talk about on slide we do continue to have payoffs in the cre portfolio we were down on an annualized basis from the first to the second quarter about but just as importantly of those payoffs of those were in the classified categories so we continue to see both payoffs and reductions through payoffs in the classified categories new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 as far during the quarter weve talked about during the first quarter we had to quickly gone through the largest loans in the portfolio we took further actions on the loan portfolio this quarter we are now through of the cre portfolio of the office and of the multifamily and just as important we also kind of lean forward because one of the big questions is how are the rapid rate increases impacting portfolios and credit quality we did an 18month look forward on the portfolio that we reunderwrote the loans those loans that had a debt service coverage of we then ordered appraisals and the end result of that is if the debt service coverage and the loan to values were below above we move those loans into the classified section so that kind of look forward pulls a lot of that risk into our current numbers and we feel that that is one of the reasons why weve seen an increase both in our criticized and our classified and our nonaccruals and ill just make a comment that over of those loans that are substandard today are still performing so we still have a very high percentage of both our classified and our nonaccrual loans that are continuing to perform and i think thats an indication that we are having a forwardlooking at the risk thats coming down the pipeline in the portfolio as we commented we continue to look at noncore businesses for us we probably have another additional billion to billion that were evaluating whether we would exit those businesses we do plan to probably move on some of that activity between now and the end of the year in most of those instances that would provide an additional million to million of additional unallocated capital and billion to billion of liquidity so well continue to look at bolstering both the liquidity and the capital on the balance sheet and then lastly we really started to build i think positive momentum in the ci franchise this is a big focus for us were roughly around billion of ci assets our goal is to get that billion to billion in the next three to five years weve done this before at other institutions were an experienced group of people were hiring experienced people to execute on this business plan and were very optimistic as a new entrant into the general specialized lending middle market lending the type of people were hiring will give us immediate access to opportunities in those spaces turning to page really kind of gives you a reflection of really the very strong and experienced team that weve accumulated at the bank as i indicated basically in five months weve recruited what i consider to be one of the strongest midsized banking teams in the industry today these are across a wide variety of disciplines ill highlight a couple on that page the second on the left from the top is kris gagnon kris brings over years of very strong experience risk management and credit management to our team kris was appointed this week to be the chief credit officer hes been on staff with us for about five months in a consulting role were really pleased to have kris and bringing the disciplines into the credit organization i think that will have a big impact and then on the far right the second one down is rich raffetto rich has joined us to lead both our ci and our private banking initiatives rich also is a very senior executive very well known in the industry rich and i worked together at us bank and hes joined our organization from city national i couldnt be more pleased to have rich on the board and some of the leadership that hes going to bring to those two disciplines where we do view the private bank and the ci as some of our biggest growth engines as we try to move forward in expanding the organization on page very busy quarter as we announced the indiscernible in addition to the mr cooper but i would like to just take for a second and focus on what are we going to look like in the future and really our focus is on being a retail bank a small business that we provide residential mortgages to our customers and prospects that come out of retail banking private banking and commercial we focus on our commercial industrial and our commercial real estate and thats really what we would define as our core businesses going into the future but as i said these two very wellrun businesses we had they were attractive acquisitions for people that are in these businesses the mortgage warehouse as i said will generate billion we sold those loans at par and we added approximately through that transaction basis points in cet1 capital ratio and we will use those new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 proceeds to pay down our wholesale borrowings and fund future ci growth as one of our other objectives is obviously to reduce overall the wholesale borrowings as we announced this morning at closing we will add basis points through the mortgage servicing sale this will help reduce our high cost and volatile mortgage deposits this is a billion allcash transaction we sold billion of assets and subservicing business at a premium to book value and we do expect this to close in so with that i will turn it over to craig and then look forward to answering questions during the qa period craig e gifford chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thank you joseph well move forward and talk to some of the numbers including a deeper dive on some of the credit position analysis if we move to slide you can see that our cet1 ratio has converted and pro forma for the business transaction as joseph mentioned is so thats a cet1 actual about basis points for the assumed conversion of the remainder of the preferred stock from the march capital raise there were two items that were gating items for that one was the shareholders approving in june an increase in our authorized shares thats been approved and the second is theres some regulatory approvals associated with some of those preferred shareholders converting to common once received that will increase our capital ratio roughly basis points and then as joseph mentioned about basis points increment associated with the warehouse portfolio thats about billion on the balance sheet in held for sale this quarter and we did receive that cash in the final closing of that earlier this week and then separately the mortgage servicing business will get us about an increase of about basis points in cet1 and thats a result of the removal of roughly billion on balance sheet carrying asset for the mortgage servicing rights which is a pretty high riskweighted asset and then a small gain on the transaction associated with the premium that we received on the business we dont have a whole lot of unrealized losses on our securities you can see that our cet1 ratio adjusted for the unrealized loss on securities at thats fairly strong compared to our category iv peers and then joseph mentioned the cash and liquidity position there are slides further back that ill go through in detail but we do find ourselves in a fairly strong liquidity position which is nice to have on page weve adjusted our forecast for the transactions that we spoke about if you recall last quarter we had mentioned that there was a potential for an asset transaction that was the warehouse transaction those numbers were not included adjusted for in the forecast we were clear about that and then separately now we have the mortgage business transaction and those are now reflected in this forecast you see that the result of the transactions is that we push out our expectation of achieving peer median returns about two quarters into the second quarter of as we redeploy the capital into lending businesses in and thats generated from those transactions you see on the slide that our tangible book value per share will be between and per share at the end of and as we look out into and we see that growing into the to share range and those numbers exclude the impact of warrants there is an impact that we do have to think about on a longterm basis in terms of the share count that would come from the warrants on the forecast page on page you can see that our net interest income shows growth and as does our net interest margin thats principally a result of the resetting of our loan portfolio to more current interest rates as new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 those loans get their reset dates over the next couple of years well have a metric in a couple of slides that shows you the significance of that impact as were rolling through the next few quarters from a provision expense standpoint well have a slide at the end that has our experience for the quarter we did record million of provision expense for the quarter million of that was chargeoffs the result of that is that given where we are today yeartodate from a provision expense we do expect that our provision expense for the year will wind up between million and billion in total for because we do expect loan growth we do have an anticipation that well have increased provisioning not only through related to current market conditions but into as we have loan growth in the ci portfolio and have to provision for that loan growth if you turn to slide we can start to talk about some of the credit results and one of the things that we have seen for the last several quarters is really strong results in terms of payoff on our cre portfolio so as we have loans that are hitting reset dates and maturity dates were certainly working to retain those borrowers where we have relationships where they bring those deposits but those borrowers are simply using our balance sheet as they hit reset dates were working to reduce our exposure to and our concentration on commercial real estate and by helping those borrowers find ways to move off the balance sheet we had almost billion in cre payoffs in the quarter and you can see that threefourths of that was from multi family and also shown on the righthand side the amount of that was in our classified portfolio so as joseph mentioned weve been pretty aggressive at looking at the ability of borrowers to repay and moving loans to classified over the last couple of quarters but those borrowers are able to find options in the marketplace as they come to their reset dates and over almost half of the payoffs this quarter were out of our classified portfolio and all of those payoffs were at par so they werent discounted payoffs on slide is an update with respect to our portfolio review as joseph mentioned last quarter we had made our way through weve only been here a few weeks but we made our way through about of the portfolio billion at this point were through about of the portfolio and that includes of the multifamily portfolio total of billion in principal balance that weve done detailed review on you can see that broken out by portfolio towards the bottom we continue to be at a very high level with respect to office only about million of the office portfolio remains under review the multifamily portfolio only about billion remains in review and in a couple of slides we have detail on that and its principally smaller balance loans which generally weve seen to have less risk on page our multifamily portfolio you can see that yearoveryear were down but importantly as i mentioned we had million of payoffs in the quarter from a quarterly perspective were down just in a singular quarter and we do expect that trend to continue on the next page ill show you how much it hits reset dates over the next two years and as we move forward we expect to continue to encourage those borrowers to find other options over the past months we had billion almost billion of our multifamily rent regulated loans that have hit their reprice dates and as i mentioned strong payoffs there almost a fourth of those loans have paid off have repriced and this is an important statistic when they reprice they reprice to an average of thats up from that trend will continue and thatll have a significant upside into our net interest margin on a go forward basis in the second quarter we did receive our annual updates from borrowers for their financial statements we have over of the portfolio that weve received annual updates on and interestingly on average the nois on those new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 updates are up yearoveryear about twothirds of the loans have increased nois and about a third have decreased nois on average increasing between and on slide is more detail on the multifamily portfolio again theres about billion that remains under review im sorry billion that remains under review and you can see that the average loan balance on those is below million and then on the far righthand side bottom of the page you can see that over the next couple of years we have roughly billion that reprices in and and then out into thats roughly billion of repricing the significant upside potential in margin as well as opportunity to decrease the concentration in cre as we work those loans off the balance sheet our office portfolio on page we had gotten through about of the portfolio last quarter we really focused on that because thats where we have quite a bit of large balance loans that were also in a space that was experiencing pretty significant market stress in terms of occupancy levels were through now and the remainder of the portfolio is only about million or so the result of working through those loans we did order and receive a lot of appraisals this quarter on those properties and thats resulted in a significant level of chargeoffs this quarter the reserve associated with the remainder of the loans is it was between and last quarter the difference there simply being the chargeoffs that we recorded for the expected level of loan loss on those loans on page our nonoffice cre portfolio its a pretty diversified set of loans you can see that on the bottom left that we have made our way through about of the loans so the half that are remaining theyre very diversified you can also see the average balance is only million and the vast majority of those are not new yorkrelated loans on page joseph mentioned that our allowance for loan loss is up to of total portfolio our credit loss reserve is up to of the total portfolio thats up from about with increases in the multifamily loans and as i mentioned the decrease in the allowance associated with office as a result of the chargeoffs that we recorded in the quarter page gives you some perspective around asset quality joseph mentioned we worked hard to identify those problem loans recognize them and work towards resolution on the bottom lefthand side nonaccrual loans grew in the quarter just shy of billion thats a fairly significant increase up from roughly million in the first quarter our delinquency data had a spike in the second quarter up to billion but subsequent to that roughly million of that has come current so the increase on the delinquencies is only up to about million importantly on the nonaccrual loans well over half of those loans are actually current on their payments in fact from us on the cre portfolio of the loans that are in nonaccrual are actually current on their payments weve just been pretty aggressive at recognizing the potential impact of the market stresses on the property values which in many cases becomes the ultimate source of repayment on page a really good news story from a deposits perspective that we have been very successful on a customer deposit raising perspective not only in our retail space where we have our premier products which had an increase of about billion for the quarter but particularly in the private bank where there had been some concerns associated with the departure of some of our private bankers weve actually seen deposit growth in that new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 space and in that business roughly million quarteroverquarter as our bankers have gotten out really connected with our customer base and were seeing return of dollars to the balance sheet as well as new relationships page shows our liquidity profile you can see the depositgathering success has significantly increased our already strong liquidity position the warehouse sale will bring us billion the mortgage sale will result in net about a reduction of about billion against that total of billion of pro forma liquidity we anticipate that we will begin to redeploy some of that incremental liquidity into the reduction of warehouse indiscernible into the reduction of wholesale borrowings over the next to days or so page has our financial results for the quarter you can see that our loss to shareholders for the quarter was million thats principally driven by the provision for loan losses of million again thats million of chargeoffs and roughly a million reserve build our net interest margin ended the quarter at we did have margin pressure from the interest reversals associated with the nonaccruals pretty significant rise obviously as i mentioned on nonaccruals that had about a 7basis point to 8basis point negative impact on margin and on a goforward basis has about a 9basis point impact to carry those loans and that impact is baked into the forecast numbers on the earlier pages over the next couple of years our balance sheet ended at billion that will go down in the third quarter as we close on the sale of warehouse loans in the third quarter and then a bit of reduction associated with the mortgage transaction and that my expectation is that we would redeploy a good chunk of that cash into paying down debt on the balance sheet so overall a summary that shares the story from a numbers perspective of moving forward to simplifying the balance sheet reducing operating risk and positioning ourselves from a strong capital position as we go through a period of uncertainty and then move into the opportunity to redeploy that capital into a more diversified balance sheet and a focus on commercial lending in addition to the commercial real estate portfolio joseph ill turn it back over to you joseph m otting president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc okay thank you very much craig appreciate the great overview on page just wanted to highlight kind of our investment profile pro forma new york community bank currently trades at roughly of fully converted tangible book value this compares to for category iv banks and for banks and assets between billion and billion our q2 tangible book value per share is or fully converted we feel as we successfully execute our strategic plan to transform the company into a focused diversified highperforming regional bank that this valuation gap will close as weve talked about we have multiple levers to be able to kind of close this valuation gap first of all focusing the portfolio on relationship banking activities is one of the key and with that we will diversify the loan portfolio from being concentrated into real estate we continue to increase the core relationshipbased deposits craig showed on the deposit page we do have a significant portion of our deposits in both interest new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 bearing and noninterestbearing demand accounts which is critical and as we grow the ci business that will also bring a lower cost of deposits and diversification to that we also think that we can increase the level of fee income generated from feebased businesses most of these products are in the company today may need some enhancements but were talking about cash management interest rate derivatives foreign exchange 401k core banking products that we can offer and do a better job of being able to provide to our customers and then lastly were very much focused on reducing and rationalize our cost structure as weve communicated we do have a plan to take out million independent of the mortgage activities of cost structure and were well on our way to achieving those cost reduction activities by the end of the year that will allow us to enter on a run rate that those cost reductions will already be in place so overall i think the progress this quarter was fantastic and really in a fivemonth period of time i think weve changed the culture we clearly changed the quality of the people that are in the organization the focus on the credit risk within the portfolio and as i commented that forwardlooking of the portfolio we think gives us really good insight to any risk thats coming down the pathway with interest rate movement or credit risk associated with fixed charge coverage we also have gone through our annual review of the portfolio in the commercial real estate where we look at every individual loan from the standpoint of their noi and how does that work in relationship to their debt service coverage today and with any potential future increases in interest rate so a lot of really good progress on behalf of the team here great momentum i think amongst people in the bank they can see the finish line that this company can be a really successful regional bank and theres a lot of good energy and excitement not only from ourselves and our employees but also as were out talking to our customers in the marketplace people are sharing that energy about flagstar new york community bank kind of rebounding back and being the bank that we can support our customers so with that ill turn it over to the operator and we can open up for the qa period of the call new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe hi just to followup on the commercial real estate book first of reviews done on office multifamily a few questions there one youve given sort of outlook for provisioning and where the reserves are but give us a sense of the loss content in this book as youve gone through and where you are seeing those chargeoffs come through on the cre book number one and secondly when you talked about loan repricing from to 8plus is that im assuming triggering some negotiation with the customer to sort of be paying down balances to kind of get ltvs et cetera in place so if you could talk to both those aspects craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so ill start on the last question so for the most part when loans are repricing we are holding the customers to the rate options that are in the loan agreements if they have strong deposit relationships or bring other business to us then well consider other options but in general were holding them to terms in the loan agreements which is pushing them to look to other opportunities and there are for many of them there are opportunities in the market that are cheaperpriced than the loan agreements and where those happen thats where were seeing the payoffs coming from so for the most part were not seeking paydowns although in certain cases well consider that as a part of a structuring arrangement particularly where its a borrower that we want to have a continuing relationship with from a chargeoffs perspective we had chargeoffs principally associated with the office portfolio in the quarter some multifamily chargeoffs as you mentioned as you repeated we have made our way through quite a bit of the multifamily portfolio in detail level the remainder of the loans generally are smaller balance generally when we look at them see lower loss levels but as we received updated borrower financial information we now have a much more refreshed view in terms of the information about the loans and where the loans are close from a debt service coverage on the repriced coupon level for those loans that are in the next months were taking a really hard look at those were generally downgrading those to substandard and were getting appraisals on those and that has led to some chargeoffs it has the potential to leave to more over the next couple of quarters as we get another slug of appraisals in new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc perfect and on those payoffs if you can talk to the appetite among the gses one of the other banks talked about theyve seen a pick up in being able to move these things or getting refied with the agencies have you seen that and given whats happened to rates even in the last few days do you think that could trigger even more stuff refiing out of the bank to the agencies craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah we do and thats what weve seen million of payoffs in multifamily in the second quarter we see that continuing and thats a good thing it helps us move towards our overall goal of reducing the concentration in commercial real estate and we do have opportunities to redeploy that liquidity including paying down debt so we see that continuing over the next several quarters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it if i may sneak in one more for joseph you gave us sort of the medium term outlook of the company given just all the moving pieces just your own numbers fourth quarter earnings went from last quarter to this quarter so clearly again a lot of stuff going on as we look at the announcements that you made on the warehouse and the servicing are we done in terms of just strategically realigning the balance sheet and the company or could we see more of such actions taking over the coming months and quarters thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah so some of that movement and reduction in those fourth quarter numbers are associated with the sale of the mortgage warehouse and the mortgage servicing in the msrs so that pushed it out because if you think about it as those are going away and were adding ci its kind of like as one is going down the other is going up and theyll crossover sometime in early so thats why we pushed it out two quarters its really affiliated that we reduce those two as i commented we do think there is an additional billion to billion of noncore activities that well be evaluating that we would look to execute on between now and the end of the year craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc but ebrahim to put some numbers to it the mortgage servicing business out into timeframe that was about million worth of fee income and about million of expense and thats what weve removed from the forecast out in that period and then over and redeployed the associated capital into lending the warehouse business we removed that billion worth of loans and then our expectation is that we would essentially swap that for ci loans beginning in and building out through late and into ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you thank you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning guys so just want to followup on the credit front so the acl if you could put some numbers as to we see your provision guide but where do you see the acl ending up following the review of this billion remaining craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so the billion thats left i mean you start to get into allotted loan count and some smaller loans and so i wouldnt say that were going to finish up billion well get into what i would say is a more normal cycle of continuing updates around the analysis of the credit portfolio but i think well see increased chargeoffs i think well see continued chargeoffs though at a lower level in the third and the fourth quarter which will likely decrease overall our acl coverage or acl reserve percentage just as we take reserve dollars and that turn into chargeoff dollars i hate to predict exactly the timing of the other chargeoffs and resulting impact on the allowance provision expense we feel like is in that million to billion range for the year joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and casey one thing i think its important is like now that were through of the portfolio and of the multi family and all there isnt like a big wing of loans left that we havent been through so when we kind of look forward you really conclude we should be through of the portfolio by the end of this quarter and it would take further deterioration in the underlying assets of the loans to see further deterioration because in most instances just remind you weve looked forward months weve taken the account any significant rate changes which theyre fairly material when you go from to that makes a big difference against the noi that immediately causes you to look at perhaps your future debt service coverage would be at or below that then causes us to get an appraisal so as craig said really over of our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform and pay ph as agree that were recognizing the future risk associated with those interest payments but the other point i would make is this isnt should not go on unless theres deterioration in the underlying assets because well be out through almost all of the portfolio by the end of the year craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah and particularly with respect to the nonaccruals anything thats a nonaccrual has already gone through getting the appraisal been charged down to the appraisal value minus the selling cost factor so the non accruals reflect a pretty focused perspective around the current condition the current value of the collateral not new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 to say that the market conditions couldnt worsen and have further degradation of the collateral but that would be the only case that we would see a need for significant increase in reserves on the nonaccruals casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and just one more on the expense front the forecast indicates a decent amount of about billion of expense leverage i know you guys have some consolidations but can you just give us some color as to how that how that progresses and what are the key drivers and where you exit the year looks like about million if i looked at so just some color there on whats a decent amount of expense leverage craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yes so actually if you think about it all the way through the forecast period that we presented so we have about a million reduction expense i mentioned about million of that is result of the mortgage business exit very very high efficiency ratio business so that overall that exit will reduce our overall efficiency ratio expectations that leaves about million million of cost reductions on billion call it billion or so so to cost reduction expectation over the next months or so indiscernible we would expect being transacted or being executed by the end of the year so that we go into on a much leaner basis with a lower cost infrastructure i do expect that well see a bit of continuing cost reductions in and then particularly as we get out into the expectation that well be able to lower some of our regulatory activities and regulatory costs into and into and thats whats driving that subsequent reduction of expenses out into the late period joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc casey the one thing that i would add to craigs comments was in addition to those cost takeouts there also is cost build both in kind of our risk framework of the organization in addition to that our ci growth and so that is kind of a net number so there is some moving elements to that number but i would also say craig and i came from us bank highly disciplined on cost structures very focused on the efficiency ratio looking how we have done things this is still three organizations that havent really totally consolidated theyve combined but not consolidated were going to be highly focused not only on the cost structure but the way we do things in processes within the organization and i would just say this is a strong discipline of ours that we are focused on each business unit or shared services part of the organization knows the number that we expect them to get to weve been working on this we have every other week meetings on the cost takeout so as weve talked about we really believe that we will hit the run rate by the fourth quarter of this year and be able to enter into at the levels that we need to be operator our next question will come from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please go ahead mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 good morning and thanks for all the detail joseph i was wondering as you understand it if mr mnuchin decided to return to the treasury or another agency within a new administration would he be required to sell his holdings in new york community joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i think thats a question better reflected for directly to mr mnuchin i dont know all the intricacies of his agreement or portfolios steven did publicly comment on that that he indicated he did not have to do that but i think i would leave that up to steven and liberty to be able to make that comment i would say steven has been a remarkable lead director in the company we value his activities and input i couldnt ask for a better partner so to speak to help us kind of navigate all the activities and he answered the bell last time when he was asked to come to washington dc and i can appreciate that comes with great sacrifices because i joined that train also to go to washington dc and quite frankly he was in my opinion one of the best treasury secretaries that weve ever had in the history of our nation mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just one followup could you share with us the number of private client teams that you have today i think it was last quarter and i know you had a lot of senior hires recently but have you hired many commercial lenders or relationship people to help drive sort of the business mix change thank you craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so ill speak to the private client so the attrition of the private client banker group weve had a couple of teams and bankers here and there but the bulk of the departure of those bankers was in the late right at the end of the first quarter early second quarter and its been quite stable since then and remarkably so has the deposit base weve lost less than of the deposits previously associated with those bankers and are now seeing deposit growth on that front so overall private client has been really really solid that team with the hiring of rich raffetto has had a place to rally around and i think has a strong view forward joseph can weigh in obviously from a people perspective but rich has already made a couple of key hires and has several more on the way so were definitely gaining traction in terms of bringing in talent in the ci space led by richs strong leadership and industry reputation joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah i would just add we did add adam feit adam was a longtime highly recognized banker and worked for union mufg out on the west coast he is going to head up our specialized industries and capital markets group rita dailey also is joining our company shes a longtime banker i worked with rita many years ago at union bank shes coming in to run our depositfocused industries and our treasury management and then were very close to hiring somebody in the northeast here who would run our national commercial banking operation and so in addition to like really really strong leadership we began to fill in if you recall we do have a number of existing ci businesses that operate in the company today and we began to like add people into those new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 businesses together so we can already those engines are kind of up and running those include things like flagstar financial some of the specialized industries and in some of those businesses we began also to add talent in those to grow those verticals as well so i would think when we meet days from now we should have a pretty long list of people that have joined us just remind you id spent virtually my entire career on commercial banking and building franchises both at us bank and then when i went to onewest bank we started from scratch in a very quick order accumulated some really talented people into the organization and grew that business to be roughly a third of the business in a short period of time and substantially increased the franchise value at onewest bank before the sale to cit mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning this quarter were there any cre loans that were sold or is most of it coming through is most of the reduction coming through paydowns and if there were no sales this quarter is there any potential to do sales as rates come down are you seeing a bid for any parts of that portfolio joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah first of all we did not really conduct any significant sales during the quarter it is our intention between now and the end of the year that we would look to reduce the nonaccrual loans through sales weve been looking at and studying a couple pools we also have some large individual loans were really excited that we added bill fitzgerald who has come in and joined our company to head up the workout group hes highly experienced in this space and were meeting weekly now really going over how do we reduce those nonaccruals through sales to the portfolio we feel these are marked appropriately and while you never quite know exactly where the market will be we do think we have a real opportunity to move a number of these assets off the balance sheet between now and the end of the year manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it but theres no willingness to sell maybe parts of the performing loan portfolio maybe shrink the asset size below billion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i mean i think we would look at everything as we kind of look out this quarter alone we really have between maturities and price resets roughly billion thats in the cre portfolio and so when you look at that i mean were estimating roughly of that portfolio should pay off this quarter weve been either notified by the borrowers so they give us indication so we are seeing just in that alone thats million or million that will go away through payoffs but for the most part what were really going to be focused on is how do we reduce those substandard and nonaccrual loans between now and the end of the year manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and maybe a more medium or longer term question as i look at the forecast update on slide you do have the net interest margins rising pretty significantly relatively flat over and can you speak to what drives that uptick is it just leaning into ci is it maturities on the cre side if you could just speak to that thanks craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc id say about threefourths of the margin lift is coming from repricing of the loans again billion in the and just take multifamily which is threefourths of the book that reprices billion a year in the next two years billion to billion out in so as you think about the impact of those repricing up from rates to rates that has a pretty significant lift on margin the other is redeployment into new lending at not higher spreads actually similar to lower spreads in the ci space but at more current market rates rather than the existing term carry rates manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc welcome operator our next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank hey guys good morning so just on the nonstrategic asset sales you identified additional billion to billion just questions was that after reviewing all of the loan portfolios how do you balance the non relationship nonstrategic assets with the ability to exit the asset at par close to par and are these potential sales excluded in this current forecast new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah well first of all the future sales are not the billion to billion however just for a point of clarification the two sales both the mortgage warehouse and the mortgage servicing and msr business is out of the forecast so that would be considered ph nav at this point the whole common denominator that weve been looking at in the company what is core noncore is where we have a relationship with the borrower and we have full relationships with the company meaning we have depository and other activities with the organization so as we look at those businesses where theres limited interactions with the customer or potential with the customer then those are being viewed as noncore andor where the relationship is predominantly a lending relationship and does not offer up any other opportunities to grow it or enhance our overall yield by crossselling craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc think about it this way theres probably billion to billion of loans in our books that we could pretty easily exit pretty easily and quickly exit at par if we needed to just from a pure capital perspective and so that has a bit of a backstop in terms of capital buffer opportunity but it would have an impact from an earnings perspective and more importantly as joseph mentioned some of those are in businesses that our client base and we want to retain so as we work through that and take out from that the businesses that are strategic the businesses that are more important to us from a growth perspective thats where you get back to that billion to billion potential that we might look at over the next couple quarters bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank okay great and then just a followup craig on the borrowers updated financial statements i think you mentioned you received of the portfolio and i believe the nois were it seemed higher than expected year overyear just anything youve gotten from that data because obviously the provisioning the credit outlook has changed dramatically and its interesting that at least from the noi comment its better but was there anything else in those financials that either kind of confirmed that the borrowers financial situations have improved or indiscernible anything you can comment on that salvatore j dimartino a executive vice president directorinvestor relations new york community bancorp inc no i think what i said was confirmed is that inflation was pretty impactful to particularly the regulated portfolio and while its fairly stabilized at this point its certainly at a much lower level of return for those borrowers but from a lender perspective to a point where it seems to have come in at a level that a lot of the loans will be able to get through or with a little bit of borrower support will be able to get through and there will be some that that will fail and thats why were focused really hard at identifying that measuring that and classifying that but again about twothirds of the nois came in higher than the previous year about onethird lower its the ones that are lower that you worry about and thats why its good that were through a significant portion of the portfolio we really focused on going out to the borrowers ensuring we got the financials pointing out to them some of the repercussions to them if they didnt provide them and making sure that we got as much current information as we could pretty quickly as we got into this portfolio new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank okay great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays please go ahead joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi jared craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks maybe just shifting to the other side of the balance sheet looking at the deposit growth whats the incremental cost of deposit growth right now and when you look at like the ddas are you are you paying up through ecr to get those and i guess the corollary is whats the value proposition for a customer incrementally coming onto the bank right now craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so in the private client and commercial space were not really paying up from an ecr perspective in the retail space we are about half of that growth was in our savings product and about half was in the cd product and were certainly priced attractively in the market from a customer perspective so were paying close attention on the opportunities as rates are receding a bit here and bringing down rates appropriately there from a private client space the vast majority of that growth actually was not premium priced it was actually pretty typical for that business which is a very transactionbased deposit set i think the average pricing on the deposits raised in the private client space was right along the lines of only about million or about million of it was in the more premiumpriced product so from a business proposition perspective obviously its our ability to serve the customers certainly in the private client space the hightouch relationship aspect and then for the retail customers its the expectation that as we move the customers into the savings products it gives us the opportunity to make broader connections and make them more sticky by expanding our product set through the branch network joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah i think craig kind of nailed it there really in the retail bank where weve seen significant amount we offered kind special five and seven craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc indiscernible new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah the five to sevenmonth cds that gave us the opportunity to expand our customer base and now ph regie and his team from the retail bank are really focusing on crossselling and i think when i was out again traveled around saw basically branches in three days you could feel theres really good energy around crossselling into that customer base and i think thats what well continue see in the retail franchise expanding those relationships jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and if i could just do a quick followup on the credit quality you talked about the 18month look forward and if its over ltv after that move to classified what portion of the npl growth this quarter was due so purely to that reevaluation that 18month look forward craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well again it wasnt necessarily the look forward it was the receipt of in large part the receipt of appraisals on the assets then moves them once we identify that the secondary source may have a shortfall then they move into nonaccrual and we take an associated charge off with it joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc but it is i think we dont have that number necessarily like right in front of us but we can see if we can get that for you and because that instead of looking at like todays loan through the review we also look forward to say what would the pricing impact be months out craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so the result of looking with the current updated borrower financial information in terms of looking out is an increase that we saw in substandards in the first quarter that then flowed through in terms of charge offs we do have an increase in substandards in the second quarter as well as a result of getting the updated borrower financial joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so if you think about it a borrower submits the data and at the current rate of we would look at that current cash flow and say hey theres sufficient debt service coverage here but then when you look forward months and if that gets caught in that net so to speak of either repricing or maturity then we also underwrite that loan at the current market interest rates and so if youre looking at current noi against a basis point increase in your interest rate thats what can push that into the nonaccrual or the substandard category craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so the numbers are in the appendix of the earnings release but think of it this way the updated borrower financial information is driving the increase in substandards the appraisal confirmation of value is whats driving the increase in nonaccruals new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steve moss with raymond james please go ahead joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hi steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning maybe we could start going back to the loans that reset this past quarter you guys mentioned theres rate just curious what is the debt service coverage for that type of borrower these days craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc starts getting pretty thin i mean the reality is youve had particularly in the rent rate regulated space you get rent increases you get inflation for a couple of years running at or and then you double the debt service and where we had to debt service coverage ratios or maybe i should say debt service coverage ratios at underwriting now you start getting down pretty low so i dont know the statistics on that exact bucket but there are certainly ones that are resetting particularly in the rentregulated space are getting in that theres a lot of them in that ph to multiple range steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and in terms of the loans that were placed on substandard or nonperforming status this quarter and im just curious are the vast majority of those interestonly loans are they rentcontrolled just kind of curious on some of the underlying characteristics craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc the reprice really reflects the whole balance reflects the general characteristics of the overall portfolio so its not there are interest only ones there certainly are rentregulated ones but its not in any particular pocket steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and just to clarify you have an 18month look forward is that kind of a cutoff for what loans are being classified as substandard or criticized these days and for those maturities that are further out in and its a long well see those build if rates stay at current levels is that kind of how to think about the pipeline new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thats exactly the way to think about it i think if rates stay higher for longer than what the current projects right now then that be a worsening of credit conditions that would have an impact on us in the future steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and one more if i can sneak on the appraisals that youre getting here what is the cap rate youre seeing whats the cap rate that youre using or receiving on appraisals indiscernible craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc its a great question it varies quite broadly between asset classes and the geography i mean even indiscernible have very different cap rates based upon the different product type but anywhere from to cap rate steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great appreciate all that i guess just maybe one last thing in terms of on the cre side you guys disclosed that theres ph threeyear ios in that portfolio curious how much of the commercial real estate is io and whats the full principal and interest debt service charge ratio for that portfolio craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so i dont have the statistics for full but i would tell you that that when we credit risk rate and we get the borrower financials we do it on a on a principal and interest fully amortizing basis were looking at the ability of those loans to cover we dont just look at interest only on a current basis steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great ill step back in the queue here thank you very much joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks for the question just want to go back to the loan sales that youre contemplating the billion to billion how much of an roe impact will that have on your longterm targets new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc we focus principally on the portfolios that dont carry much spread arent highmargin so i wouldnt expect it would have a significant negative impact on roe christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right so less than the sales that you had in this quarter okay and then with the servicing sale are there deposits that will go with that or can you quantify craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc there are so the servicing deposits move up and down pretty ph volatily but at the end of the month theyre slightly above call it their low point typically at the end of the month so about billion of deposits in the servicing business now well get billion back from the cash on the sale transaction so netnet impact on liquidity is just a little bit over billion christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and those are very highcost deposits craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah theres two sets of those deposits theres the deposits on our owned servicing theyre fairly low cost thats about billion but then the other billion billion is fairly highcost deposits on the subservicing business so im not sad to see those go it basically worked out kind of neutral to us from a funding cost perspective joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and are probably the highest cost of all those debt portfolios christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i was hoping you could just talk little bit about the overall balance sheet size rest of this year to i think the guidance suggests that earning assets stay between call it billion but im curious just how youre weighing the decision around saying over billon or going below and then with that if you do decide to stay over billion when do you become subject to the category iv bank stress test is that event or event craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc so the current projections are that we wouldnt come below billion in total assets we absolutely will have a decrease so we were at earning assets of billion billion at the end of june wed see that drift down to the end of the year around billion principally related to the mortgage warehouse loans being sold here in the third quarter as you think about moving forward in billion we do have a much higher level of on balance sheet liquidity that we have to hold as a category iv bank officially we became a category iv bank on october of with respect to the stress test cat iv banks are up every other year ph on even year so our expectation is that we wouldnt be in the in the ccar stress test cycle until submission we do run our own company run stress tests and in fact submitted to the federal reserve our companyrun stress test here in and well do so again in but we dont expect to be held to the federal reserverun stress test until matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great and then could you just help me out with the nim outlook for the next couple of quarters and i would really appreciate if you could provide what accretable yield was for this quarter expectations through the end of the year craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah so accretable yield is tapering down i think lets just say it adds probably basis points or basis points to the margin and it tapers down through into the middle of next year the expectation around margin is that we will see a continued reduction principally as a result of the warehouse sale coming off of the balance sheet over the next couple of quarters but given the full year margin here hate to give exact predictions on the quarters but well see it via at this level to slightly down over the next two quarters matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then i know youd mentioned some cash levels liquidity levels are high youre going to use it to pay down some wholesale could you just give us some frame or reference of where you think the cash to assets ratio will sit by the end of the year and is that a good level where you want to be in craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 well i think the deposit growth that we had in the second quarter is strong it gives us the capacity to gave us the capacity to let those highcost deposits with the mortgage business go and if you think about the cash that we get from the warehouse sale i think youll see that that will be sort of in the level that well redeploy into paying down debt is around the level of what we get from the warehouse and i think that puts us at an appropriate position as we look forward well have deposit growth that will allow us to continue to repay debt and well have loan paydowns that will then be redeploying into new lending categories matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then when all is said and done with the preferred conversions let me back up i appreciate you providing the common shares outstanding with the reverse share split what is the impact from the warrants on the diluted that we should expect going forward craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc well so it really depends on what you expect in terms of the share price theyll be net ph sellable and so its public information how many warrants are out there but current share price is not particularly impactful more share price at a higher share price then that net settlement could lead to a much higher level of shares but its hard to predict exactly what the share price would be and when those holders would choose to convert or when they choose to net exercise matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay last quick one from me just some understanding as to why loan administration income went negative this quarter and is that negative million a decent run rate here craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc from a loan administration perspective i guess i would say that it relates to a number of factors the servicing business some of the trickleon stuff that we had associated with the fdic and servicing their loans i would expect after the servicing sale our loan and administration income would be essentially zero matthew breese q analyst stephens inc thank you thats all i had joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc great thank you operator our final question will come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey craig on slide the provision expectations obviously increased and i dont know maybe its unfair to ask for an accurate outlook last quarter but what kind of confidence level do you have in the provision outlook that youre providing craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc id say that higher confidence level than we had last quarter i mean the management team not only were new but not all of them were here we have a new chief credit officer hes here hes been in the house for about a month and is really dug in and then again we had our updated borrower financial information level was about at the end of the first quarter and its now so we have a lot more visibility and that drives a lot of the measurements really whats left is some appraisal gathering but weve generally provisioned where we would expect that would come in but from a loan classification standpoint there will be some additional ph trickleon impact most of that came in in the second quarter i wont give you a confidence level but i would say its we have a much higher confidence level now than we did at the end of the first quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats fair on npa expectations i think youre signaling we should expect another increase in q3 is that fair is it going to be a step function or how can you prepare us for what we should see in npas in the third quarter craig e gifford a chief financial officer senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yeah it wont be as significant as it was in the second quarter i think well see some increase but i think as joseph mentioned well be working to taper that back with transactions where we dispose off some of that npa bucket will that exactly net out probably not in the third quarter as we look into the fourth quarter our expectation is wed be able to keep that flat to down as we get into the fourth quarter and into early next year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good last one joseph for you id call it a financial psychology question but where do you feel the most rushed or under pressure in terms of your daytoday tasks im curious if you feel like is it triage mode or is that unfair and is this all kind of methodical at this point for you joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well i think weve spent a lot of time over the last days really understanding the company and digging into the attributes i think when we met last time we said there were really kind of three buckets that we were really focused on one was getting our earnings accurate and forecasting and communicating those and understanding the consequences of activities the second was really making sure we understood the loan book and that we new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 understand the risk and we could communicate that risk with a degree of confidence and the third was building out our risk infrastructure within the company this organization grew very quickly both the talent and infrastructure of the risk organization was not in place if you look on that page where weve added talent you can see a lot of the talent that weve added have occ experience and are here to help us build that infrastructure so if we decide to stay above billion that we have the right risk infrastructure for category iv bank but the third big bucket being that we really including my background being comptroller of the currency we view that a very important part of an organization that we have the right risk infrastructure so id say in those three buckets we feel like weve made incredible progress and then i would also say we recognize the desire to have a very strong liquidity and capital in the bank as were making these movements to become more simpler we also want to have a very fortress liquidity and equity of the company jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you very much joseph m otting a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc welcome operator i will now turn the call back over to joseph otting for any closing remarks joseph m otting president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc okay thank you very much operator very much appreciate everybody joining i would say theres a lot of really good energy around the company and the direction were heading we now have i think a very experienced executive and leadership team to execute the business plan we will have a simpler organization when weve concluded the asset sales and move the company forward we will maintain liquidity and capital which we think are more than necessary to run this organization and that at the same time were really much focused on growing the bank and the sectors that weve communicated specifically in the private bank the retail bank small business and the ci segments of our company too often people can get ph dragged into the problems and not be thinking about the solution and i just want to assure the investment community and our investors that were also focused on what this company will look like in the future so thank you very much for your time and your interest its very much
