which will continue to accelerate growth in the future switching to deposits consistent with prior guidance our third quarter endofperiod balances were stable with average balances down nearly billion

management business we ranked number two through number nine nationally in most tm payment types as shown in eys annual cash management survey we have a strong deposit base and new relationship growth engines in both our consumer and commercial business lines and we expect deposit production momentum that we built during the third quarter to produce growth in the fourth quarter turning to the income statement the strength and diversification of our feebased businesses throughout the bank has helped to partially offset market headwinds all banks are experiencing in commercial our gross treasury management revenue increased compared to the yearago quarter led by our expert ar and expert ap solutions our capital markets revenue associated with helping clients hedge share exposure to rates commodities and foreign exchange increased compared to the yearago quarter in consumer we generated strong mortgage revenue growth this quarter in an otherwise challenging environment thanks to the strength of our mortgage servicing operation fifth third is a lowcost highquality servicer one of the only banks to be recognized as both a fannie mae star servicer and a hud grade a servicer the actions we took to grow our msr portfolio nearly since the end of will continue to pay dividends going forward fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 finally in wealth management excluding tax payments we have generated positive aum inflows in every one of the past quarters and we were recognized this quarter as the best private bank for high net worth clients by the digital banker and global private banker magazine we continue to focus on maintaining our culture of prudent expense management across the company while investing in organic growth and tech modernization initiatives in the third quarter we made meaningful progress in our technology and platform modernization journey we successfully migrated our core platforms to a new data center and have now virtualized over of our servers strengthening network resiliency increasing speed and capacity and improving the experience for both our customers and employees in the fourth quarter well relaunch our mobile app in a new cloudbased architecture and with several improvements to the user experience credit quality remains strong throughout the bank our chargeoff ratio was basis points for the quarter and our nonperforming asset ratio declined compared to the prior quarter we remain cautious with respect to the broader economy given persistent inflation the feds aggressive monetary policies and global growth concerns weve continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on highquality relationships and companies with more diversified resilient business models we continue to proactively monitor our portfolios for signs of potential stress and regardless of what comes im confident in our ability to outperform peers through the full economic cycle with respect to capital we announced a increase to the quarterly common dividend in september we continue to accrete capital with strong ppnr growth and expect to achieve a cet1 by yearend we also expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of subject to economic conditions we continue to make decisions with the longterm in mind hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do and invest in product and service innovations that generate longterm sustainable value for customers communities employees and shareholders with that i will now turn it over to jamie to provide additional detail on our third quarter financial results and our current outlook james c leonard chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today we are pleased with our third quarter results we generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record adjusted revenue nii was positively impacted by higher market rates fee income was resilient despite the marketrelated headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses consequently we achieved a adjusted efficiency ratio also excluding net securities losses related to two legacy venture capital investments we generated core ppnr growth of compared to last quarter and compared to last year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 net interest income was approximately billion a record quarter and increased sequentially and yearoveryear primarily attributable to the benefit of higher market rates growth in commercial loan balances and the full quarter benefit of securities purchased in the second quarter our nim expanded basis points during the quarter while interestbearing core deposit costs increased basis points to basis points in total this quarter this equates to a cycletodate deposit beta of thus far on the first basis points of rate hikes total reported noninterest income decreased just sequentially we generated improved mortgage banking and leasing business fee income which was offset by softer results in marketsensitive businesses including capital markets and the impact of higher earnings credit rates in treasury management noninterest expense increased compared to the prior quarter driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense including the impact of the july minimum wage increase to per hour higher technology and communications expense reflecting our focus on technology modernization initiatives and the full quarter impact of the dividend finance acquisition expenses in the quarter included a million benefit related to the marktomarket impact of nonqualified deferred compensation with a corresponding offset in securities losses this compares to a million benefit in the prior quarter excluding the nqdc impacts from both periods total noninterest expense increased million or noninterest expense was flat compared to the yearago quarter despite the impacts of our fintech lending acquisitions of both dividend and provide moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases increased sequentially including held forsale loans total average loans increased compared to the prior quarter average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter with muted payoffs and a stable revolver utilization rate of period end commercial loans increased sequentially and compared to the yearago quarter average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter driven by dividend finance which as a reminder is recorded in other consumer loans as well as growth in residential mortgage this growth was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans at quarter end dividend loan balances were approximately billion average core deposits decreased compared to both the yearago quarter and the prior quarter impacted by the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits in the second quarter and lower consumer interest checking balances in the third quarter compared to the yearago quarter average commercial transaction deposits decreased while average consumer transaction deposits increased reflecting our continued success growing consumer households we grew our securities portfolio approximately billion during the third quarter compared to billion in the prior quarter we currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year we have continued to focus on maintaining structure in the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows our overall allocation to bullet and lockedout structures at quarter end remained at and our duration declined to in the current quarter compared to in the prior quarter fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 moving to credit as tim mentioned credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remain well below normalized levels the npa ratio of basis points was down basis point sequentially our commercial npa ratio has now declined for eight consecutive quarters the net chargeoff ratio was flat sequentially at basis points the ratio of earlystage loan delinquencies to days past due remain relatively stable sequentially and the amount of loans days past due was approximately twothirds of what it was a year ago we continue to closely monitor central business district hotels nonprofit health care including senior living and office cre we are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leveraged loan portfolio from a balance sheet management perspective we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on highquality commercial relationships and on homeowners which are of our consumer portfolio we maintain the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in both commercial real estate and in nonprime borrowers among our peers through the dividend and provide acquisitions we added granular fixed rate loan origination platforms we have also focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong stable nii through the cycle our strong deposit franchise our securities and cash flow hedge portfolios as well as the additions of dividend and provides lending capabilities should continue to position us to drive strong outcomes in the cash flow hedge portfolio we have added an incremental billion since the end of the second quarter bringing the total cash flow hedges added this year to billion the combined securities and cash flow hedge positions will support nii through the end of the decade moving to the acl our acl build this quarter was million primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a slightly worsening economic outlook relative to june dividend finance loan growth contributed million to this acl build relative to the second quarter the moodys gdp growth forecasts are slightly stronger while the unemployment and home price forecasts have weakened in both the baseline and downside scenarios given our expected periodend loan growth including stronger production from dividend finance we currently expect a fourth quarter build to the acl of approximately million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios the impact of the expected dividend loan originations to the acl should be in the million to million range due to our improved loan growth expectations our economic scenarios incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains including continued aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated our september allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment future baseline unemployment estimates may begin to be increasingly impacted by the feds aggressive monetary policies moving to capital our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at compared to in the quarter the increase in capital was primarily due to our strong earnings capacity partially offset by rwa growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities moving to our current outlook for the fourth quarter of we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up sequentially we expect commercial loans to grow reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain stable at we expect fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 consumer balances to be stable to down reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital and lower residential mortgage balances partially offset by dividend loan originations of around billion in the fourth quarter from a funding perspective we expect average core deposits to increase to sequentially however we do expect some continued migration from dda into interestbearing products wholesale funding balances should be stable given expected core deposit growth relative to our earning asset base shifting to the income statement we expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue growth of compared to the third quarter excluding the third quarter security losses associated with legacy venture equity investments we expect nii to be up approximately sequentially assuming a basis point hike in november and another basis points in december we expect a cumulative deposit beta of around by yearend this should result in interestbearing core deposit costs rising from basis points in the third quarter to the mid tohigh basis point area for the fourth quarter we expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up to compared to the third quarter or stable excluding the impacts of the tra we have a strong ma advisory pipeline and expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue which we expect will be offset by earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue given the rate environment we expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to the third quarter reflecting continued investments in talent technology and our southeast branch expansion our guidance assumes we open new branches of which will be in our highgrowth southeast markets our fourth quarter guide implies stable expenses for on a full year basis compared to and adjusted revenue growth excluding securities losses resulting in ppnr growth in the highteens this will result in a mid efficiency ratio for the full year a fourpoint improvement from and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio in the to range we expect fourth quarter net chargeoffs to be in the to basis point range which will result in full year net chargeoffs of approximately basis points in summary with our ppnr growth engine disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate longterm sustainable value for customers communities employees and shareholders with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks james before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call up for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i was hoping you guys could sort of address the maybe jamie thats for you kind of walk through the puts and takes with dividend finance i think since that closed the origination expectations have been great and continue to increase but so do the reserve build expectations so maybe just some thoughts on how much longer will those related reserve builds last and how is the overall accretion from that transaction trending relative to what you would have thought at announcement james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah thanks for the question scott its a good one and timely because the dividend expectations on loan growth have continued to go up and up their performance continues to be very strong from a loan origination standpoint when we bought them they were fifth in market share and our best estimate is that theyre top three in market share now today and its certainly a booming business given the rising energy costs so with that we had originally modeled a fiveyear earnback on the acquisition that theyd be profitable in ex the acl and in with the acl and theyre certainly tracking ahead of those expectations obviously the challenge during this quarter and as we look ahead given their strong loan growth is the acl build the acl build and the credit performance is in line with how we modeled the portfolio with the annual loss rates peaking at a chargeoff rate give or take but given the longdated nature of the asset it results in a much higher acl build than some of our other loan categories and so were going to be providing at a pretty healthy rate in dollars given their strong loan production and that could be million to million next quarter and perhaps every quarter in given that we expect billion or more per quarter from them so i guess thats a long answer to say its a good problem to have in the longterm because its a highreturning asset both from a nii perspective but also a return on the capital its just the unfortunate cost of providing life of loan losses at origination fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay thank you for that color and then maybe the followup you guys have really good common equity tier and are anticipating resuming share repurchase early next year but the tce ratio continues to dip from the aoci maybe if you can sort of just discuss the extent to which tce if at all weighs into your capital decisions i think one of the emerging questions at market is if investors are going to sort of rally behind share repurchase from a low starting point of tce so just curious to hear your thoughts there james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp well thanks for the question because as you know i do have some opinions on this topic and bear with me a moment while i walk through it because we run the company looking at metrics that both include and exclude aoci and weve been showing you both sets of metrics for better or for worse consistently over the past decade whether thats rotce or tangible book value per share or tce and when you look at the tangible book value per share excluding aoci we actually grew it in the quarter and for the year even with the dividend finance acquisition so really when it comes down to the lower tce ratio and the tangible book value per share including the aoci it really does come down to how the aoci is moving and so when bryan and i talk about this and have been thinking through it we think were really mixing two issues into that one question the first question when you parse it out is really based on how do i feel about our investment portfolios positioning and performance and i would answer that as i feel very good about how we are positioned and especially how were positioned relative to peers would it have been great to time the market perfectly and hit the very best entry points of course but our two years of patience definitely paid off for us on a relative basis we continue to have one of the highestyielding portfolios and among the lowest unrealized losses as a percent of total securities in the industry so the potential tce and aoci issue from this perspective ultimately comes down to whether you have a lowquality or poorly structured investment portfolio that will incur losses in the future we do not we will accrete to basis points or about billion of tce per year going forward and do not expect to incur any losses in the portfolio and as weve always said given the high composition of floating rate loans on our balance sheet the investment portfolio should act as a shock absorber in a falling rate environment and we believe the nice duration and structure that we have in the portfolio will do just that so then the second question that gets mixed into this is then should we be putting securities in htm instead of afs and as weve said before as a category iv bank the election to put the security into afs or htm really doesnt impact regulatory capital other than a small deferred tax asset impact nor does it change the economics or the risk of an investment for the largest banks clearly theres value to minimizing the risk of regulatory capital volatility by using the held tomaturity bucket for banks like us we believe the benefits of maintaining some flexibility to manage the portfolio through a volatile environment really does create value for us through the cycle and given that theres no change in the actual value of a security simply based on the accounting classification of which the portfolio that we put the securities in so it really does come down to do we think the company from a fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 tce or value perspective is worth less by simply fairvaluing one line item in the balance sheet or is it worth less because we placed the security in afs and the answer to that we believe is clearly no so our goal is always optimize the balance sheet to deliver longterm real economic value and not make decisions that optimize accounting outcomes over economic value so with that i apologize for what may have just been the longest answer in the history of earnings calls timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp but as you might imagine we feel strongly about this topic timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp and if i can put a point on it no it has not factored into the decisions that we make on a dayin dayout basis and the way that we run the company or as it relates to capital return r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect no i appreciate that color its an interesting issue to say the least and its having kind of wideranging ramifications i really appreciate that thank you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp no problem operator your next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc wanted to see if you can give us a little more color on your thoughts on deposit growth i know that you indicated that you do expect growth in the fourth quarter maybe you can help size up that level of growth and then how do you think about growth into particularly given that youve completed the deliberate deposit balance exits fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 that you had talked about so how are you thinking about maybe also in the perspective of the non interestbearing mix as a percentage of the total how you expect that shifting as well thanks timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah bryan why dont you address the first part of the question and then ill talk a little bit about why we think we can grow deposits in so go ahead bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah i mean our goals always to grow deposits and take share every year weve obviously got a strong consumer household growth or investments in our southeast markets or leading tm business we have confidence that we can take share we obviously have some full year headwinds on average balances due to the excess commercial balances we intentionally let run off in but we do expect to grow from these levels into probably up to kind of range you obviously have normal seasonality that we should expect to benefit from from a commercial perspective as we also continue to grow households and grow our commercial relationships timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes i think i just would add john to put a point on it we do feel good about our ability to grow deposits the remainder of this year and as bryan said about our ability to grow deposits on an ongoing basis if you just step back and look at the engines that drive deposit growth here the integration of the branch and the digital offering has been very powerful for fifth third right and over the course of the past few years the investments weve been making in the southeast have really accelerated and that is evident in the rate of growth that we see in those markets like i mentioned household growth as an example there the only bank that has built more branches in the last three years in the southeast than fifth third is jpmorgan chase okay so we have a very fresh branch network we have another 20plus branches that will be opened before the end of this year and are on pace to do another next year all of which are in really highgrowth markets i mentioned the millionth momentum banking household was it was opened in the third quarter of this year i dont think i could overstate the way in which that sort of a product offering changes the nature of the relationship with a customer like if you just assume the checking account has a average balance a point of interest on equates to about a month and i mean think about how many other places you spend more than a month and get less value than were providing now in momentum as it relates to helping you to manage cash flow and achieve savings goals and move money efficiently and otherwise and i think that is going to be a very powerful driver of growth it just makes those core retail deposits stickier than they were in the past and lastly then we talked about the treasury management business and weve shared in some of our investor conference presentations this ratio of turnover to average balances in commercial so if you just look at ach volumes over average balances and compare that across banks in our peer group fifth third has by far and away the highest turnover which is a really good thing because what that means is that the balances that are fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 sitting here are being used to support the cash flow velocity of the business as opposed to being treated like an investment alternative right and so if you take that as the foundation of the deposit business here and take into account how hard it is to build those sorts of capabilities over a period of years its going to be a pretty powerful moat for the bank going forward and i think well be able to grow from there james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and then john on your dda mix question when we look back to the last tightening cycle our total ddas to total core deposits dropped points from to this cycle we started at and we model a similar decline or i should say were forecasting a decline and then we actually model in the rate risk disclosures in the presentation additional migration even beyond that so were assuming a similar mix shift as last tightening cycle but as tim mentioned our product lineup is certainly different and better and the treasury management market share certainly has improved since the last cycle but either way we feel good about how were forecasting it and think it will be manageable john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks jamie and then separately on credit if you could just give us some color on the drivers of the higher loan delinquencies in the quarter it looks like both days and to went up and then separately maybe just thoughts on the trajectory of the loan loss reserve ratio excluding what youre doing with dividend finance do you expect additions here on the underlying reserve beyond that portfolio thanks richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah its richard ill start with the delinquency comment and ill let jamie talk about the acl changes look the starting from a small base we had a couple we have a couple of deals roll into delinquency you have a couple roll out theres really no trend theres no pattern with respect to industry or borrower type i think its just a little bit of seasonality in terms of or a little bit of just a small change in terms of borrower impact as we get through the end of the quarter james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp then on the acl the driver of the coverage ratio this quarter was certainly dividend more than anything else but the other impact being a little bit worsening in the moodys scenario so from here if dividend loans continue to grow and be an outsized portion of our originations then that coverage ratio just because of that loan mix shift will continue to increase but otherwise you wouldnt expect the acl coverage ratio to go up or down unless the economic scenario changes or the credit profile improves or worsens more than what we currently have modeled john pancari q analyst evercore group llc right okay great thanks again jamie operator your next question is from the line of michael mayo with wells fargo please go ahead fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi tim you started off the call talking about virtualizing of your workload or i missed some of what you had to say but what does that mean for your efficiency ratio of where do you think a terminal efficiency ratio is how much do you have in stranded costs and on the other hand the inflation rate costs that hurt your expenses so i guess im looking for longerterm expense and efficiency guidance and the implications of some of these tech moves timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes i had you in mind as we were writing that paragraph mike in terms of the data centers and virtualizing applications its that i think the way to think about what we are getting to at this point as weve talked for many years now about the opportunities that we have to use the cloud whether it was private or public to take some of the load off of legacy mainframe infrastructure and to put it into an environment that allow it to be much more scalable and resilient over time and we hit a couple of important milestones in the quarter in that regard hence the commentary about the data center move and having virtualized now a little over of the servers inside the company long term i think we feel very good about the ability to drive efficiency on the maintenance and network infrastructure side of the it business but we also intend to be able to continue to invest on an ongoing basis on new frontend application development and in building new capabilities into the products and services so i think what we said in the past is the technology spend has been growing at call it on an ongoing basis but you should expect that sort of growth to continue but that it would be offset by our ability to eliminate manual processes and drive automation into the company and if you look at banks in totality people expense is about half of our total expense on an annual basis so theres still a lot of opportunity in front of us in a three to fiveyear timeframe to substitute technology for work that has to be done manually today thats where i think the efficiency opportunities are and as it relates to the long term a efficiency ratio i believe is as we were looking at it this morning the best of any of the commercial banks over billion that are reporting so i feel really good about where were at at the moment and the intent is to be able to run the company in that sort of to range on an ongoing basis michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so how many data centers do you have left and is it your goal to eventually have no data centers as you have indicated timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp no well have two well have two well always have two theres a lot of efficiency in being able to run certain applications and then be able to store data in your own private environment you need to have redundancy michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so with the moves that just happened can you size those cost savings or those savings are simply going to help selffund your new tech investments fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp therell be the mechanism to fund the new tech investments michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to ask a couple of questions one i heard the commentary around deposits earlier and the outlook for deposit growth from effectively benefiting from the new branches et cetera that youve been putting in could you just give us a sense of that branch trajectory from here and what youre anticipating over the course of the next year or two and then also give us a sense as to what your deposit pricing strategies are as well for the next several quarters timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah sure ill take the branch trajectory bryan you can take handle that i think we have been running on a pace to open call it to new branches a year wed like to see that be in the more of the to range so well hit mid this year the expectation is to end up somewhere between and next year and to have the to a year range be what we run in the southeast markets until we achieve the market position that we want to be able to achieve in each of the msas that we are focused on down there now on a net basis the branch network has not been growing that fast because we have taken advantage of opportunities as customers have done more of the transactional activity online to thin out or relocate branches in the legacy network which has provided a basis for funding several of the investments that were making down in the southeast bryan do you want to talk about rate fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah yeah absolutely thanks tim we continue to feel good about what weve been able to do on the deposit front the pricing is obviously starting to get more competitive especially in the commercial portfolios but we feel good about the cumulative beta that we have talked about for that first basis points in hikes certainly as rates move higher from here were going to continue to see some increase in betas and weve previously talked about maybe that next basis points of hikes those betas will get over but we think were going to be able to manage to below cumulative beta from here certainly a little bit higher on commercial than on the consumer side but we recognize as rates move higher you are going to start to see more consumer beta flow through as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right i noticed you upped your cd offers and matched jp which is i know a competitive positioning that youve got a lot of your footprint so thats helpful color on the fromhere beta that youre looking for maybe you could just give us a sense on loan growth trajectory of because one of the things obviously were all thinking about is dollars loan growth and dollars deposit growth and any expectation that you would need to lean on wholesale funding a little bit more i did notice in the quarter your averages went up at in wholesale funding but that looks like it was action that you took at the end of so maybe just give us a sense as to how you see that all trajecting thanks timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah right so betsy from my standpoint on loan growth i think the guide in the fourth quarter is stable to on a quarteroverquarter basis that feels like a pretty good benchmark right if you were to start on something for where we see loan growth going we have really strong production coming out of dividend as we mentioned and are very pleased with the performance there and also strong production on provide on ci more broadly i think we have been deliberate about moderating production over the course of this past year you can see that in the numbers but the production itself is still really good its more granular than it had been in the past which is an important strategic priority for us what i think i dont see a catalyst for is a material move from here on utilization rates right and against that strength in the fintech platforms and good core middle market production in ci youre going to have the drag from the slowdown in the auto production and mortgages that i think we started on perhaps earlier than others and therefore will make its way into the numbers faster than you may see it in other places against that the goal is always to grow deposits we like to be able to grow deposits faster than loans that really is a tenet of the way that we try to grow the company that doesnt always happen in any one quarter but we do expect fourth quarter to deposit growth and while were still in the early stages of the planning process we intend to grow deposits next year bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah and betsy from an overall funding perspective our wholesale funding portfolio as a percent of our asset base is obviously down a decent amount from where we were precovid it was kind of closer to of total fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 assets precovid from a longterm debt perspective that number is down to more like right now our loan todeposit ratio obviously is still near those historic lows and so over time we do expect to have more structure in our liability base as well as a little bit more longterm debt so even if we were to see some moments of loan growth faster than deposit growth we have confidence in our ability to fund it and adding some of that structure to our balance sheet is a decent place to be as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right no i noticed your liquidity sources its a very fulsome slide so really appreciate that thank you operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning just a couple of questions on the fee side understanding your guide is flat to the million i just wanted to understand tim in your intro you mentioned that mortgage servicing will continue to be a benefit so does the mortgage business hang in from here going forward and then the second question is just can you flesh out a little bit for us just the impact of earnings credit rates on service charges and what type of impact that could have going forward as well thank you james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah hey ken its jamie ill take that one since weve had long discussions over the years on the strength or lack thereof in our mortgage business and happy to report that the third quarter was a very nice mortgage performance for fifth third and i do think from a top line perspective volumes will be down given the environment into the fourth quarter but what youre seeing in the strength of the business is really that servicing revenue shine through and as tim mentioned in his prepared remarks were one of the top servicers rated in the industry and the improvement in that revenue stream is part of why we beat the outlook for the third quarter and will help support the mortgage fee business going forward we were running the mortgage banking in the first half of the year total mortgage banking fees i think in the first six months of the year were million and were going to grow that over the back half of the year simply driven by the strength of that mortgage servicing business that we operate so we feel good about that thats a run rate servicing fees net of msr decay should be around million to million a quarter going forward and thats going to be a yielding asset for us but again the top line will be a little bit challenged so that netnet assuming no msr valuation changes i would expect the mortgage banking fee line to be in that million to million range in the fourth quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and sorry on the service charges with regards to the ecr impact there and does that continue to how does that trend going forward fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah when we look just at the fourth quarter the top line fee equivalent as tim mentioned we have very strong pipeline and good business and so top line will be growing or so but to your point the earnings credit just given the rising rate environment will result in total service charges being down to and we have earnings credits moving similar to the deposit betas and so theyll continue to edge higher as the fed keeps moving on rates ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay if i could just ask one more just on your slide you added billion more swaps since the end of the second quarter and we can see how youve laddered that all out just can you help us just understand as you start to look past in terms of nii can you continue to show a positive nii growth given the positive beta comments you made earlier and just the trajectory of the protection that youve put on to the balance sheet thanks jamie bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah ken its bryan thanks for the question based on where we stand today we feel good about our exit rate nim in carrying over into with some upside as our balance sheet continues to benefit from the hikes weve previously talked about that nim in that kind of to range assuming a terminal fed funds rate we think our nim will peak in mid3 in the first half of we do expect to give some of that upside back as deposit repricing lags catch up but given the balance sheet actions weve taken todate to monetize our asset sensitivity we expect we can maintain a 330plus nim over the next couple years even if rates were to fall basis points obviously and beyond results are subject to significant uncertainty given the economic outlook and well give you additional color on expectations as part of our fourth quarter earnings in january ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks a lot bryan timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes if im just going to throw one editorial comment in here ken because you hit on two of the topics that were spending a lot of time talking about internally is i think perhaps because we operated for years in a nearzero interest rate environment people forgot about what longterm drives performance in the banking business and if theres anything that that current point in the cycle is reminding us its that deposits matter and that diversified fee income business lines matter and that interest rate risk and credit risk management matter and by those measures if you look at where we are right now i mean the companys been around for years and this is literally going to be its best year ever in terms of profitability and the strength of some of these fee lines like mortgage servicing right like what we have been able to do on top line with treasury management and the quality of the deposit base coupled with the prudence that i think that our treasury which has done really fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 an outstanding job here and that we have in the credit organization is going to set fifth third up to be able to perform very well regardless of what look like ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks for the color tim operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs please go ahead timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning actually my questions have been asked and answered thanks so much guys timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thank you operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning any impact to the dividend finance business from recent legislation i guess its called the inflation reduction act but theres a lot of climate initiatives in there that i know help some broader areas but any impact to that business in terms of volumes and reducing the credit versus what you thought it would have been before timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah it will be a tailwind for the business when we underwrote the business and entered into the agreement to buy dividend the assumption we were using in our base case was that the federal tax credits would expire and the actions in the inflation reduction act are only going to help support it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then as you think about how big this portfolio can get or youre willing to let it get obviously theres a lot of room to run but if youre originating over billion a year and its pretty long duration the balances could fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 build pretty quickly any thoughts on kind of how big i know ive asked you before but how big it can get and youre willing to let it go bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah i mean obviously theres a lot that can change over the next couple years as outlooks and things adjust and rate expectations change but as we look at it now and given the capacity that we have on the consumer side because we are going to continue to let our auto portfolio run down getting that portfolio north of billion doesnt cause us any concerns and we also know that there is a pretty robust market whether its securitizations or whole loan markets where were going to have the ability to manage the portfolio risk associated with these assets so we feel good about our options associated with it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then actually just following from my first question im a little slow today with all these long week but the benefit of this credit does this increase the volume reduce the kind of longterm expected credit cost or a little bit of both timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp it increases the volume matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp the way to think about it is that from the homeowners perspective clearly theres an incentive to impact your own personal carbon footprint but these decisions ultimately get made on an economic basis so the tradeoff that the homeowner is making is the cost to install the panels and then to service the debt attached to that relative to the cost to pay an energy bill for energy that you buy from the utility company on a monthtomonth basis so anything that reduces the installation costs on the side of solar or that increases the cost of buying energy off of the grid is beneficial to the size of the overall market is the way to think about it matt and dividend being one of the largest players anything that positively impacts the tam for residential solar positively impacts the outlook from an origination perspective so thats why i expect the benefit primarily to be as it relates to the fed or the extension of federal tax credits matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc that makes sense and obviously higher energy prices can also increase demand then timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah yes fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc would there be an opportunity to securitize or like figure out a way to increase the ability to originate even more without keeping it on balance sheet over time timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc maybe its more 5years out timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp we i think bryan mentioned that dividend has been a topfive originator or jamie mentioned it and we believe its a top3 originator today the other players in the top five are all funding through whole loan transfers or securitizations so there is a very liquid market for the asset we have the ability to run at an origination level that is above and beyond what we would hold in the portfolio if we elected to do it but that as you said earlier we have a long way to run between where were at today and where we would stop and add very attractive yields from the standpoint of nim enhancement and overall credit performance matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thanks so much timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi jamie timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc tim you talked about fifth third as one of the most active branch openers in the southeast along with jpmorgan chase can you give us some color on the cost of opening and i know each branch is just different but a typical fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 cost of opening a branch what type of deposit level you need to reach to make it breakeven and how long does it take you to reach to get to that deposit level if you use deposits as the measure for breakeven james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah gerard its jamie thanks for the question weve really reduced the square footage in the branches so that the cost between land and construction is much lower than it used to be and it can range from million to million of book value maybe a few hub branches would go higher than that but for the most part thats where the investment cost is and as you know the people side the staffing is about half of the cost of operating a branch and so you start to make money when you get into the millionplus deposit range and so that usually takes us two and half years or so sometimes three sometimes two but our recent de novos are tracking well against the model and actually are outperforming on a household growth basis so thats part of the reason why were continuing the strategy and as we look ahead to next year we did new branches this year in total and we should do or so next year primarily in the southeast gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and jamie when you get to that breakeven point how many how much longer does it take to get to a return on investment or a return on equity however you measure it to have it at the level that youre very satisfied with james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah five years is really where leading up to the fiveyear mark and you then become profitable flip over probably at that on a cumulative basis and then the earnings power really starts to accumulate beyond that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup yeah go ahead tim timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp i was going to say that these are investments with extremely high terminal values right if you look at the branches that we have across the network today it is especially in a world where i think we have done a very good job of being able to integrate the digital investments that we make and the access to a human being in the local market right weve talked a lot about the ways in which were using analytics and other direct connection points to make sure that thats a seamless experience for customers it just has proven to be a very strong long term recipe to grow the franchise and the longer the fed stays up the faster the breakeven on those branches materializes and that their the more attractive that the returns look like right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes very true thank you as a followup on credit obviously your credit quality is very strong similar to your peers maybe just remind us why are the customers i mean you look at all of the economic outlook you mentioned jamie about moodys it was a little worse than what you had in the prior quarter in terms of building fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 up the reserves how is it that credit just remains so strong in view of these cross currents particularly in the housing market starting to weaken and then the second as part of this can you just share with us also about the used car prices obviously theyre finally starting to come down you guys are in that market and how does that impact maybe future charge offs or delinquencies if prices continue to fall down timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah im going to let richard provide more specificity but gerard if you just step back and look at it because this is the conundrum that i think we find ourselves in as we look forward and think about how we run the business relative to the signal weve got today on the consumer side of the equation if you look at fifth third consumer checking deposit balances they are essentially exactly where they were about between to depending on the cohort youre looking at above where they were at in february of and that ratio has stayed more or less perfectly constant since the third stimulus check okay so there were the temporary spike as tax refunds came in this past year that money got spent down by and large over the summer but it restabilized in that sort of to range one two at least in our case such a significant percentage of our consumer exposure is to homeowners right its of total exposure and of our credit card and auto customers are homeowners that they had an opportunity to lock in historically low fixed rate mortgages and to manage housing costs in the past couple of years that will allow them as long as theyre seeing to wage inflation which is kind of where weve been running to manage headline cpi pretty well right and the byproduct of that is the liquidity buffer is there and they have leverage over their costs in a way that others didnt i think equivalently richard and i have been out together in several markets recently talking directly with customers and what we hear by and large is that customers have been able demand has stayed very strong and that customers have been able to exercise pricing leverage and to push input costs through to their customers right the i think the dynamic in fact with them and in each case that they all remain more concerned by is although supply chain pressures have eased a little bit theyre still concerned about the stability of global supply chains and are making investments to support that and then labor is the other primary constraint right now and there again i think where there is good activity going on a lot of it is going on to fund capex to drive labor productivity so that labor requirements can go down at a given level of demand now first principles would tell you that with the fed moving as rapidly as it is and with rates having headed the direction they have that at some point here the rate cycle has to turn into a credit cycle and that i think is the reason why weve been maybe more cautious in terms of some of our actions than it feels like we hear other people being because we just think that its prudent at this point in time but i mean richard do you want to talk a little bit about some of the other specifics richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah i think the one thing to add on commercial gerard is remember theres a loss emergence period so it takes a little while for the stress to ultimately roll through loss and i think what we see and tim articulated a lot of it is our customers are adapting and theyve had to adapt honestly for about three years now lets if you go fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 back to the tariffs were a challenge for a lot of supply chains and manufacturing they had to adapt theyve learned that in covid youve had inflation and so we see resilient business owners do what they do and thats adapt to the challenges and run their businesses well and i think thats part of the conversation and thats what we get from our relationship and our relationship managers talking to customers really get good insight to whats happening on the ground and i think as tim said theres more strength there from a fundamental perspective than perhaps people would otherwise believe now to your question on auto i think the answer is autos going to be a really classic example of a normalization and again youve got a shorter generally shorter duration in terms of the asset and that loss emergence period and you have two things that are happening at the same time one clearly you can see it with manheim used car prices are down and trending down normalizing at the same time were going to be rolling into originations where we bought at or customers bought at higher car prices so we dont really see anything abnormal except for an acceleration of this intersection between car values and the originated loantovalue getting back to something that looks more normal again its a super prime book for the most part were disciplined on the underwriting the resilience when you look at things like delinquencies continue to be very very good in fact theyre at continue to be at seasonal lows so i think its just this intersection of prices coming down and origination prices coming up gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just one quick followup on that during the financial crisis with housing and many times houses fell below the mortgage value and people if they were unemployed and couldnt afford it walked away from the house if auto loans really go upside down and loantovalues start to get up to because of the manheim number keeps falling have you guys seen any history of people literally just turning the keys over to the car because the loan is upside down or is that really not a factor in the auto market richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp its certainly not a factor today in fact gerard if anything think about where auto prices have gone youre seeing were seeing customers and we see this across the spectrum that we dont lend into they dont want to have to go turn the car in and buy a new one its too expensive so theyre doing a lot of things to keep their car and to stay current or work through with the lenders we dont see a lot of that because we dont really have that situation given the quality of our consumer but right now i think people if theyre if they have a job they want to keep their car they dont want to go buy a new one gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great okay thank you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thank you fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 operator todays final question will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning thanks hey good morning tim and jamie i really appreciate hearing your thought process on the earlier question about tce would your response to that question change at all if we had a credit cycle and the fed wasnt able to lower rates due to inflation so the securities portfolio wasnt able to add as much of a shock absorber as you described earlier and then to bring that back to the broader question is there a point where decreases in tce would become a concern for you in that scenario in particular james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp well i guess first off weve been accreting capital just through the strong earnings power of the company thats going to continue as tim mentioned cet1 will grow in the fourth quarter so obviously that will help the tce ratio and then when we pick up the buybacks next year well run the company at that cet1 level thats our expectation if theres a credit cycle credit events i think we will be very happy that we have the portfolio we do given the structure as well as the duration that we have so im not worried about the performance of the investment portfolio i would say that its probably the best portfolio in the industry so we feel good about that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and then separately on the funding side can you speak to your ability to bring off balance sheet client funds back on balance sheet and the potential amount that is available in theory james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah right now theres about billion in our client liquidity portal and then theres also opportunity within the wealth asset management business but again that would just come down to the willingness to pay beta type of pricing and then at this point in time theres no need to do that but if we wanted to match money market rates we could certainly bring more deposits back onto the sheet bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks bill fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q3 earnings
