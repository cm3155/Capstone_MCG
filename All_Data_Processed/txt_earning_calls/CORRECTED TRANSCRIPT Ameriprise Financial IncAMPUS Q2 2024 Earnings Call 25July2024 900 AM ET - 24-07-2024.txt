billion from a year ago excluding the legacy insurance partner asset transfer which came through both in retail and institutional channels in retail overall we had improvement in gross sales up billion from last year with a slight improvement in redemptions though were in net outflows our equity results are outpacing the industry and we see an opportunity to gain more flows in fixed income institutional flows were slightly positive in the quarter driven primarily from wins in the apac region and were putting additional emphasis on models smas and etfs and beginning to gain traction we continue to focus on transforming our global asset management business to gain greater operational efficiencies leveraging resources and technology globally you saw that our ga expenses decreased in the quarter and we have a number of additional actions underway to further derive benefits throughout the year in asset management were maintaining good fee levels and good margins at ameriprise our model and overall firm has enabled us to perform very well over market and environmental cycles we continue to leverage our global capabilities as well as steadily invest in technology digital

excellent returns and returns to shareholders in a significant way ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 looking forward we have the right strategic focus growth investments a talented team and a meaningful opportunity to drive greater growth now walter will provide additional color on our financials walter walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim adjusted operating eps grew to adjusted for of severance expense associated with the companys reengineering initiatives reflecting earnings growth across all of our businesses the diversified nature of our businesses drive our consistent financial performance across market cycles and sets us apart from most in the financial services industry assets under management and administration increased to trillion benefiting from strong client flows over the past year and equity market appreciation this has resulted in strong revenue growth across our businesses as you know we continue to manage expenses tightly to maintain strong margins ga expenses were down excluding severance expenses demonstrating our continued focus on reengineering and operational transformation we continue to selectively invest in areas that will drive future business growth particularly in wealth management we will maintain our expense discipline in to achieve growth and shareholder objectives our returns remained strong with a consolidated margin of excluding severance expenses and a bestin class return of equity of balance sheet fundamentals including excess capital and liquidity remain very strong our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contribution across all business segments we returned million of capital to shareholders in the quarter in we continue to expect to return of operating earnings to shareholders on slide youll see the strong results from wealth management client and wrap assets increased and respectively from strong net flows and market appreciation over the past year wrap flows were strong in the quarter at billion or a annualized flow rate in the quarter adjusted operating net revenues increased to billion from growth in client assets increased transactional activity and increase in net investment income in the bank this drove revenue per advisor to a new high of up from a year ago total cash balances including thirdparty money market funds and brokered cds were billion which was over of clients assets as clients remain heavily concentrated in yieldoriented products with highly liquid products like money market funds being more in favor than term products like certificates and brokered cds we are beginning to see clients put money back to work and wrap and other products on our platform and we expect this to continue over time as markets and rates normalize which creates a significant opportunity cash balances excluding money market funds and brokered cds were billion driven by normal seasonal tax patterns and the transition of cash related to comerica partnership in other products underlying cash sweep was stable in the quarter as expected and that trend continues in july i want to provide some additional perspective on sweep cash our cash sweep is a transaction account for money in motion that is in between investments or for cash to pay fees which is similar to a bank checking account cash sweep is not meant to be an investment option for significant cash balances over extended periods ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 we have a broad range of higheryielding products available for clients seeking to hold cash over extended periods which is where a large portion of the excess cash has gone as a result our clients generally have very low cash rebalances which are now approximately on average at this point we do not anticipate any changes in our approach to cash sweep adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased with distribution expenses of reflecting business growth including comerica and increased transactional activity ga expenses were flat at million reflecting investments for business growth offset by reengineering initiatives this combination of revenue growth and wellmanaged expenses resulted in a business sustaining at an operating margin of turning to asset management on slide financial results were very strong in the quarter and we continue to manage the business well through a challenging environment for active asset management total aum increased to billion primarily from higher equity market appreciation partially offset by net outflows in the quarter operating earnings increased to million as a result of equity market appreciation and disciplined expense management which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows and margin was reflecting strong market appreciation and expense discipline adjusted operating expenses decreased with general and administrative expenses down from a year ago reflecting the benefits from comprehensive expense management initiatives taken to date we are looking globally especially in emea to enhance operating efficiency and manage expenses so we are well positioned going forward lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business that has been built over a long period of time pretax adjusted operating earnings in the quarter increased to million reflecting the benefit from strong markets and higher interest rates partially offset by higher distribution expenses associated with strong sales levels overall retirement protection solutions improved in the quarter with protection sales up to million primarily in highermargin vul products variable annuity sales grew to billion with strong momentum in our structured products turning to the balance sheet on slide balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remains strong with growth in excess capital to billion we have diverse sources of dividends from all our businesses enabled by strong underlying fundamentals this supports our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders and invest for future business growth in the last year we returned billion of capital to shareholders including million in the quarter ameriprise consistent capital return drives longterm shareholder value now lets finish with slide ameriprise delivered excellent growth in the second quarter which is a continuation of our long track record across market cycles and our commitment to profitable growth over the last months revenues grew earnings per share increased roe grew basis points excluding unlocking and we returned billion of capital to shareholders we had similar growth trends over the past five years with revenue growth eps compounded annual growth return on equity improvement nearly percentage points and we returned billion of capital to shareholders these trends are consistent over the longer term as well compared to most financial services companies this differentiated performance across multiple cycles speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix as well as our focus on profitable growth with that well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions suneet kamath from jefferies is online with your first question please go ahead suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc great thank you good morning i wanted to start with the cash sweep commentary walter so it doesnt sound like youre planning on making any big changes but i know in the past youve said thats always subject to the competitive environment obviously weve seen a handful of companies take some actions on their cash sweep rate so i guess the question is im trying to reconcile those two is it that the moves that those peers are making are sort of catching up to you or is your sort of client account size different that youre just not experiencing the same need to make those changes walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay thanks suneet i guess let me start we as you know we operate within regulatory and fiduciary standards i and therefore we feel certainly looking at sweep in its transactional aspect of cash and motion its totally appropriate and aligned i cant really comment on what is whats taking place with the wirehouses i dont understand it i really i think we all i know is what we do from that standpoint and all the actions we have taken to ensure that the money is in sweep is really for transactional purposes and its at the levels you know that we the majority of it is in under account balances are under our rates are competitive and we keep the appropriate level of cash that we think is necessary to operate so that is the focus of us and we feel very comfortable with that and obviously well evaluate things as it goes but we looking at what we have today we think its totally appropriate suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and then just another one on the bank so i think maybe at the fourth quarter call walter you said you expected bank nii would be higher in than which seems to be the case yeartodate but then you also made a comment about just wondering if you think that you could continue to see bank nii growth as we move into over and maybe unpack some of the underlying drivers thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc as i remember what i said clearly over but i still believe it was slow but yes but the net interest income should be higher that statement i think its still valid suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc and the drivers there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 well the driver is obviously were investing over and so we feel that as maturities and our short duration that it will give us that momentum and we are adding but well obviously be measured but were adding suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks operator ryan krueger with kbw is on with your next question please go ahead ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning first one was just can you disclose how much of your client cash is specifically held in your wrap advisory accounts walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc its about billion ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay great thank you and then i guess another question was just on recruiting your experienced recruits have slowed down a bit yeartodate can you comment on what youre seeing from a competitive environment for hiring experienced advisors and just kind of any thoughts on why the slowdown and your expectations for the rest of the year james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we saw again a bit of a slowdown into the second quarter we cant tell you exactly why it looks like people would stay and put a little bit based on markets et cetera and moving into the i guess into the seasonal we see a good pickup in our pipeline again and so we think that will improve as we go forward but other than that speaking to the team thats really what they saw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator alex blostein from goldman sachs is online with your next question please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey thanks good morning so i wanted to go back to your comments regarding clients starting to put capital to work and money to work in wrap and we saw those net flows pick up a little bit can you talk a little bit about where the cash is coming from is it ultimately coming out of the kind of billion billion balance that currently sits in sweep and your certificates business or is this coming out from other sources kind of like money ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 market funds that sit off balance sheet or outside of the sweep program and maybe just remind us how much cash ultimately still on the sidelines outside of that billion billion number walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so if i understand alex your question about i think our total cash is about billion and so therefore in money markets and in thirdparty cds its about 40someodd billion dollars and we are seeing that certainly money is still coming into i would say money markets theyre probably money markets and but its and slowed a little on the cd side and so from that standpoint there is we are seeing less in cds and there is a shift people are staying shorter from that standpoint as theyre trying to take advantage on the yield curve thats the trend that were seeing about now alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you i guess what im trying to get to is clients rerisk and extend duration and put capital to work which you capture those economics in your wrap program which is great but should we expect that to put any pressure on the billion balance across sort of sweep and your certificates business or could that remain fairly stable as money comes out of other forms of kind of cash options walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well thats a good question and we do anticipate because obviously from an economic standpoint that would be beneficial to us weve had new money go in there and yes as it gets redeployed that would be beneficial and we think that was certainly will be a source of the repositioning alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay got you and then quick followup so ga really well managed i think if you look at this quarter excluding severance i think youre at like million or something like that for q2 how should you sort of think about ga evolving through the rest of the year and i know you highlighted a number of some kind of savings programs that you continue to sort of find so maybe any sort of early thoughts on your ga outlook would be helpful thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ph al listen on is i can say that we feel certainly were the expenses are being well managed and certainly as we reposition and look at our process changes the number of efficiencies that were getting there so i think i feel comfortable as we said for we certainly will continue were going to be investing in the business so i would say you should see wellmanaged expenses but we are going to be investing for growth alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay thank you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so i think its part of the way you certainly have seen we have operated in prior years and certainly especially in we manage our expenses in proportion to our revenue and manage our margin alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah i got you okay great thanks walter operator brennan hawken with ubs is online with your next question please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thanks for taking my questions curious to drill down a little bit on the billion of sweep within advisory accounts so do you know what portion of that billion would include ameriprise as a fiduciary or investment advisor so a little more specifically what portion of that billion would be in the employee channel and in any portfolios where ameriprise centrally managed or central models where ameriprise is the advisor james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc a lot of our central models are really run by outside managers institutional and oversight is there and again even in those type of models its roughly around or so and even in our advisor discretion its actually less than on the institutional models so i would probably say as you look at it now we havent broken that out between employee nonemployee et cetera because these models are all run in certain ways but it is as walter said a very low balance its whats about or so and there is constant trading activities fees being pulled the foreign taxes being paid things like that so its not as though this and a lot of the actual cash if theres any higher balance whether institutional or otherwise they are moved into money markets and other short duration products as well so thats how we look at it and manage it and that has been appropriate we disclosed that very clearly and from a clients and a legal perspective we feel very comfortable with what that is brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank great thanks for that color jim and then you spoke to increased engagement in your banking offering and weve heard some firms some competitor firms of yours note that we may be seeing the beginning of improvement in pledge loan growth so curious whether youre seeing that or perhaps even just early signs of that james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we saw nice increases in our pledge loan as we again go through the year we will be launching another indiscernible which we know has been popular out in the industry so that will be coming on ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 board over the next quarter or so weve also seen some increase as we started to put some direct cds and savings programs in for cash to come in externally from that from our clients again were just starting that up but no we think that as we launch these other products in the bank advisors are looking for them and we feel like they will over time gone or built assets as well as we can then deal with some of the lending activities appropriate brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank okay but no specific pickup in the pledge run yet james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes we saw a nice pickup i dont have it in front of me do you we can get it for you but we saw a nice pickup in the quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank great thank you operator steven chubak with wolfe research is online with your next question please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to ask about the competitive landscape and just net new asset trends more broadly wrap flows as you noted were quite strong in the quarter certainly an encouraging sign but consolidated flows were a bit weaker i know on the last quarters call you alluded to some irrational actors just more aggressive pay packages potentially impacting the pace of organic growth just hoping we can get some sort of marktomarket any update in terms of what youre seeing on the outlook for indiscernible walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so certainly as you indicated wrap was quite strong on the client they were we saw both in certificates and annuities some lapsing and that impacted it and our we look at our growth rates and we certainly feel that theyre aligned with the industry so from that standpoint we are getting traction we feel comfortable with it and so we see that trajectory basically we feel comfortable james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i mean we looked at there was a little bit of a slowing to your point in the second quarter overall and we did look and say okay is there any in particular outside of the usual activities people just didnt add as much advisors i guess with the market and everything and very clearly it looked the same way as we looked at some of the across the industry so it wasnt like were an outlier ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful and then just for my followup on the asset management margin despite the pressure on fees the operating margins continue to run above target so certainly encouraging to see i was hoping you could speak to the margin outlook over the next few quarters whether you believe you can sustainably run above the longerterm target of to barring any negative or exogenous market shocks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well as you saw were maintaining a consistent stable fee levels yes we had some additional outflows with a very low fee basis and we are adjusting our model and expense base leveraging the technology leveraging our global resources et cetera that we continue to do that helps to offset any pressure that we received from a flow basis again barring changes in market conditions we think that we can maintain sort of a good margin for the business based on what were doing we are investing so were not cutting from areas that we want to grow in as i mentioned we gained flows even though its not in the numbers we discussed to you with models so more money has gone in there were starting to gain traction as well in smas which we think will be good and as well in etfs and we will be looking as we even pursue some active etfs as we go forward so there are things that we are doing at the same time we are trying to free up expenses and resources based on the investments weve made and use our resources globally to get more efficiencies steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great color and thanks for taking my questions operator wilma burdis from raymond james is online with your next question please go ahead wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning i know you talked a little bit about the margin but do you think theres a lot more wiggle room on expenses in the segment in asset management thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so yes we feel like as we continue as you saw there was additional severance we took in the second quarter part of that was in the asset management business and there are continued changes that were looking to make and improving and tightening the way we operate with our processes and efficiencies and freeing up resources and things that arent generating the value that we need and so we are actually pursuing those things as well and there will be some further adjustments as we move forward wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc i know you guys dont get asked too much about the insurance business anymore but the margins seem pretty good there it seems like you grew a little bit in the quarter is that more interesting to grow at this time or how are you guys thinking about that thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so you indiscernible growth in the insurance and annuities the structured instrument and the vul products which are both very good products for us and actually the reason there wasnt more earnings for and its because when you first book that you got the distribution expense upfront that youre is the cost so over time that increase in volumes will also add to the earnings mix we also got very good rates now as we reinvested on the investment side and the spreads there so i think the business will be a good strong consistent contributor and a lot of that is free cash flow that we utilize for buyback so we feel very good and you also saw in the quarter again even in the ltc business that we had nice earnings there as we continue to make adjustments take rate invest appropriately and invest out so were feeling very good about how that will add to the total of the company operator thomas gallagher from evercore isi is online with your next question please go ahead thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning walter just to come back just a quick one on the cash sweep based on your answer to suneets question it sounds like you arent very focused on what the big peers are doing competitively on cash sweep crediting rates now to me that just implies you probably dont really see it as a big issue for ameriprise either competitively regulatory litigationwise is that a fair conclusion or maybe you can expand a little more on that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so the question is i dont understand what the drivers are we certainly understand their rates and it is part of an evaluation that we go through so that was all you should read into what i was saying certainly we evaluated a competitive elements as we look at it but it is i just cant comment on some of the drivers or the elements that are creating what the change is for james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and tom as we look at it again we have very low balance a very low percentage and particularly in the wrap that is there we do see the money through transactions and fees so you dont want to go where you dont have it or selling a security at the same time youre pulling on some of these things or clearing so we look at institutional accounts its the same thing so were not exactly sure what the change is from the wirehouse et cetera but again until we know anything differently we feel very comfortable and from a competitive frame the same way i mean this is not money we have a lot of different places where our advisors move money to and same thing with models and the money if it is positional is in those other type of earning assets rather than we keep it in sweep walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and the one proof point again which really were under and if you look at the industry theyre between and so it plays we have just less levels there because its strictly used for cash in motion ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and you dont see any issues with the new dol fiduciary standards related to this nothing on that front that youre focused on walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc indiscernible thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks and then just for a followup on the rps segment i guess one thing that strikes me is your nii has been up a lot particularly yearoveryear in that segment even quarteroverquarter its up a lot and jim i heard your point about distribution expenses and that is true i mean you could see the numbers those are higher based on better sales but if you would have told me a year ago that your nii would be up as much as it would i would have thought the run rate would be a lot higher in that segment right now so i guess my question is what is going on with the other kind of components of your pl in that business are you seeing higher mortality or disability claims is it the annuity earnings that have been a drag maybe just a little perspective on kind of whats really driving the ship here because it for the strength in nii its a little surprising that were not seeing more hitting the bottom line thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well theres nothing that really stands out as you look at it our disability claims are quite good and actually and our insurance claims are within expectations so there is no one driver from that standpoint so ph i guess we are performing where we thought we would let me take that away and to see where youre driving up because i just dont see it at this stage its a fair point so let me take a look at it and see what youre going and we can get back okay hows that thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi that would be great thanks walter operator john barnidge from piper sandler is online with your next question please go ahead john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you for the opportunity you called out the election in your comments can you talk about how youre expecting that to impact operations and planning for such i can imagine it can impact some asset management product demand but do you think it has an impact on advisor recruitment or how you think about marketing expense thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 no well i think its more from a client perspective right so clients want to understand a bit better what does it mean based on who gets in what policies how it would affect investments i think you can hear that even from market funds and speaking in the airwaves so again thats always the top of mind triggered by those types of things that they hear so we provide market strategies we look at what the implications of changes in policy may be or what type of investment is appropriate and so thats more of where it is now how does that work with advisors it depends on how clients are if they feel like more comfortable then theyll put more money to work and the same thing with the advisor if they feel a little bit that there will be a change or implications ph they hold i dont at this point i dont see fundamentally anything driving it in a major way but as you get closer to the election and theres more conversations i think and thats what we usually see before an election i dont think it fundamentally changes it but you do see based on who gets in and whether policy changes whether there are impacts as far as what people invest what they rotate out of john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you for that answer my followup question can you talk about some examples of leveraging the global operational efficiencies for the asset management business in the way maybe you were not previously doing so thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so when i talk weve spent a lot of time in energy as an example of integrating the bmo acquisition with threadneedle but also putting them on global platforms that we have our global trading platform are ensuring that we have the right attribution across how were leveraging research all those various things and with that we feel like we can now move the people and the processes who operate more consistently get more efficiencies where we locate the resources whether we have them in the us we have them in ph europe we have them in india et cetera so we look at that as well to drive efficiencies and then with that we really want to ensure that we are leveraging the technology more fully and so those are the things that were doing as we look across sometimes because of the overlaps like we had a lot of overlaps because of the bmo acquisition with what we had in place we couldnt really do that until the technology until the legal entities until all of the human resources were dealt with appropriately and so now theres another opportunity for us to further streamline that and get some further efficiencies from that is that helpful to you john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co it is indeed thank you very much operator michael cyprys from morgan stanley is online with your next question please go ahead michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you just wanted to circle back to the cash sweep commentary just hoping you could clarify for us how and to what extent are advisors compensated on cash sweep balances and more broadly there just given some of the industry movements and understand your commentary and views there but just curious more broadly how you see the scope over time for the way customers pay for services to evolve and potentially over time move ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 away from sweep and is that draconian scenario over time plays out where economics and things shift just curious how you might be able to continue to capture economics what are other ways that customers could pay for services james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well again as i said wherever you are you have transactional activity that you want to settle and you want to you have to do that timely right but you dont want to put people on margin you dont want to indiscernible other securities at the wrong time so theres always a certain low level of cash now what we really do is monitor and if cash is in any account at a larger level that we really look for it to be moved and so as you saw as people moved out of some fixed income instruments or where we have put them further into the market they did invest in a lot of cash instruments money markets cds various other shortterm duration fixed and so we saw that occurring in the reality of it and actually the sweep actually went lower rather than increase and so thats the same thing in all of the wrap and institutional now within that if there is more money sitting in that count we dont want that cash to be a high balance even if its invested out because thats not the purpose of wrap account but in so doing if there is positional cash and theyre in earning instruments then the advisors do get paid et cetera but again thats something thats monitored and we feel very comfortable with it so as far as the future is concerned theres always adjustments that will occur in pricing and what you would have to do to offset some of the cost of your services that we will constantly look at but if youre asking in the nearterm we feel very good about where that is right now were not exactly sure what some of the changes that some people are bringing in about for what reasons so im not sure that was as clear as it maybe to you but it wasnt to us michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and then just a followup question on the asset management business so i was hoping you could elaborate a bit on some of the wins you referenced in the apac region and maybe you can elaborate on that and remind us of your footprint in apac and where you see some of the best opportunities there as you look out over the next couple of years just in terms of countries there and strategies thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we mainly we have a small wholesaling working with private banks et cetera in the region but a lot of it is more institutional basis and its again as you would imagine some of the core products we have both in europe in equities as an example or in the us and in maybe even things like our fixed income investment grade various things like that so weve been gaining some traction there same thing a bit more that were seeing as potential opportunities in our real estate so those are the things that we have underway we recently expanded a little bit in japan were in korea and places like that singapore australia so there are different places where we are getting it mainly from larger institutions from some pension funds some sovereign wealth things like that ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q2
