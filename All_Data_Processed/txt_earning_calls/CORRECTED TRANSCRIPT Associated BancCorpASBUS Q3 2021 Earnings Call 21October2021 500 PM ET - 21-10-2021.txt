welcome to our third quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined today by chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer i want to kick things off by covering the macro highlights for the quarter and give you an update on the strategic initiatives that we presented both internally and externally last month then chris will walk you through where we are in margin fees and expenses and then finally pat will close us out with an update on credit on a macro level we continue to see signs of a strengthening economy in our markets unemployment rates in wisconsin and minnesota remained at or below and manufacturing has been consistently expanding which is reflected in the positive momentum were seeing in the midwestern footprint while the third quarter news cycle is dominated by over concerns of surging delta variant and supply chain challenges we do remain optimistic about growth in the latter part of this year and into next our customers are doing well sound credit performance continues to be foundational and associated is well positioned to participate in the coming expansion now let me touch on third quarter highlights as outlined on slide on the top line we saw revenue expansion across all key areas of our business interest income grew our fee businesses grew and we realized additional gains during the quarter we also see signs of increasing customer confidence with spending activity deposit levels and capital market transactions all up from the second quarter on the liability side rising deposit levels have also allowed us to further moderate our funding costs now shifting to credit we continue to benefit from improving credit backdrop as we work our way through our customers have proven to be resilient and markets have continued to recover throughout the year after posting reserve releases in each of quarter one and quarter two we posted another negative provision in the third quarter and further net reserve release our cecl reserves are now below our cecl day levels from an operating expense perspective we continue to be disciplined even as we embark on our multiple initiatives and aside from the million of facility exit costs we incurred in q3 expenses were fairly flat taken together these factors helped us drive our yeartodate returns on average tangible common equity to over moving to slide i want to divestiture a little deeper in the loans we shared back in q2 that we were starting to see signs of increased lending activity and line utilization in our commercial portfolios and im pleased to announce that this trend has carried over into the third quarter average commercial and business lending loans excluding ppp grew by over quarteroverquarter led by general commercial additionally we continue to see growth in several specialized lending categories as cre construction while certain aspects of the economy faced unexpected headwinds during the quarter due to resurgence of covid we continue to be encouraged by the conversations were having on the frontline and the numbers that are starting to merge in our pipelines were also encouraged by customer activity consumer activity we officially launched our auto finance vertical in september and have already funded loans across states we are excited about the early returns in our auto business this addition to our product set allows us to further diversify our consumer lending portfolio and earn slightly better spreads in our traditional mortgage origination activities consumer card spending activity was also remarkably strong during the quarter outstanding credit card balances increased quarteroverquarter a greater than annualized rate suggesting a significant uptick in the associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 confidence of our retail customers and finally our ppp and oil and gas portfolios continue to run off as expected we expect the majority of our remaining ppp to be paid down in q4 and we expect the oil and gas portfolio to be largely paid down over the coming year additional loan trends for the third quarter are highlighted on slide on a longer term trend were pleased to see commercial and business lending rebound during the quarter reflecting our first expansion in more than five quarters line utilization was a contributor to the rebound commercial line utilization numbers continue to close the gap relative to our historical levels in april our commercial customers are funding about percentage points below our historic line utilization levels by september this gap had narrowed to percentage points and while we still remain well below our precovid monthly averages our september line utilization was the highest weve seen since july of and our momentum coming out of the august lull we experienced seems to be establishing a positive trend construction lending was also a bright spot for the quarter as our proactive commercial real estate team continue to grow both outstandings and commitments on a yearoveryear basis and given our substantial back book and construction commitments were confident outstandings will continue to grow well into late as we look to the fourth quarter we remain optimistic around loan growth but are adjusting our expectation in response to the economic headwinds that played out in the third quarter specifically we now expect fullyear commercial growth that is cre and ci combined excluding ppp of approximately on slide we provided a walk forward of our quarterly pretax preprovision income from the second quarter to the third quarter and while our pretax income was essentially flat for the quarter this masked the million improvement in our pretax preprovision results and our positive operating leverage looking past the million drop in provisioning both interest income and fee income items were significant contributors to our quarterover quarter improvement i mentioned last quarter that we expected expansion in pretax preprovision income over the second half of to more than cover the incremental cost contemplated for our newly announced initiatives we remain committed to these targets as we head into q4 now turning to slide id like to highlight that we announced our strategic vision back in september we said wed start executing on our strategies immediately and we have slide shows some of the steps weve taken to make real progress against the four key pillars of our strategic plan we continue to expand our lending capabilities our auto finance business is up and running with book loans and nearly dealer partners signed up we are currently originating loans in a pilot mode across states and dealers origination activity to date has been in line with our expectations and wed be looking to ramp up our volumes as we move through q4 and roll out our program to our broader dealer network in addition weve rounded out the executive leadership team for both our equipment finance and our asset based lending initiatives we continued to add experienced relationship managers and lending specialists into our core markets to better serve the needs of our commercial and small business customers and we brought increased focus to our wealth management areas while targeting new opportunities across our footprint associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 on the digital front were on track to transform our consumer digital banking experience in the first quarter with the launch of a new platform bringing increased customization and architecture that more easily allow us to integrate fintech partners to improve the customer experience this is our first big step in a plan that will transition spending towards our digital channels and technology over the next several years and finally were always looking for ways to optimize our capital and balance sheet and in the third quarter alone we redeemed million of preferred stock repurchased million of common stock and increased our common dividend by simply put we are full steam ahead on our efforts and we look forward to building on this momentum as we head into so let me pause there and hand it over to chris niles our chief financial officer to provide further detail on our margin and income statement trends for the quarter chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy turning to slide our net interest income increased million from the prior quarter or driven by higher interest income across the board and lower funding and time deposit costs our quarterly net interest margin increased slightly expanding basis point quartertoquarter weve seen slowing refinance activity which has stabilized our mortgage yields and a steady decline in liability costs nim continued to be pressured by high liquidity levels and compressed commercial loan yields moving to slide we continue to see record average deposit levels third quarter average deposits were up over billion or on a yearoveryear basis this growth continued to be concentrated in our lowcost deposit categories lowcost deposits have grown approximately billion from a year ago and at quarterend accounted for of our total deposits during the quarter we continued to work down our highcost network and time deposit balances this decreased by approximately billion from the third quarter of meanwhile our aggregate and wholesale funding levels have continued to steadily decrease over the past five quarters and have decreased by nearly billion yearoveryear looking forward the deposit pricing and funding actions we have taken are anticipated to help improve our margins in q4 and into turning to slide given the high levels of liquidity we began investing in securities late in q3 we anticipate deploying additional cash balances into investment securities over the next nine months reinvestment yields are expected to be approximately or better and accretive to our current portfolio earnings we continue to target investments and total assets ratio of between and for and expect to rebuild the investment portfolio to somewhere north of of assets by yearend looking forward we expect our full year margin to end this year at approximately for the full year now turning to slide i will comment on noninterest income trends fee income grew nicely during the quarter we saw growth across several key categories including our mortgage banking unit where net income grew million from the prior quarter assisted by msr recoveries we also saw solid growth in our feebased revenues where service charges on deposits and account fees were up for the quarter and up yearoveryear cardbased fees were also up taken together we view these trends as encouraging indicators of growth growing consumer confidence as we emerge from the pandemic our noninterest income for the quarter also included million in asset gains tied to private equity distributions but even excluding this impact income grew by nearly from the previous quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 reflecting a continued strength in our core fee businesses we now expected to finish at the upper end of our most recent fee guidance range on slide we highlight our expenses the third quarter came in at million a million increase from the prior quarter including million of facilities exit costs excluding these exit costs expenses were up about million as we continue to roll out our new strategic initiatives we remain committed to maintaining our expense management discipline taking into consideration all the pending initiative actions we continue to expect our total noninterest expense to come in consistent with our prior guidance range lastly let me comment on capital as shown on slide our tangible book value per share continues to grow quarteroverquarter and has increased yearoveryear to associated regulatory capital levels all remained strong our common equity tier ratio has grown from the third quarter even as we referred to shares redeemed for third and increased the dividend we will continue to target tce levels at or above and cet1 at or above with that let me turn it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern speaking updates on credit portfolio patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks chris i want to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide we utilized the moodys september baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast assumes additional fiscal support a continuing low interest rate environment the recent acceleration in consumer prices to be transitory and relatively localized covid cases following net reserve releases of million and million in the first and second quarters of respectively we posted a further net release of million in the third quarter this net release was driven by gross reductions in our allowance for all of our core commercial and cre business units with a million gross reduction in our allowance related to our general and commercial and business lending portfolio a million reduction in our cre allowance a million reduction in oil and gas and a million reduction in retail lending as of september our total acll was million down from million in the prior quarter furthermore our ratio of reserves to loans declined to from during the quarter we had previously guided that we expected acll to loans to drop back down to cecl day levels by the end of and three quarters of the way through the year weve dropped comfortably below that mark turning to our quarterly credit trends presented on slide most of our key credit metrics continued to improve over the course of the quarter our key covid commercial exposures continued to decline for the quarter led by declines in our retailer and shopping center exposures nonaccrual loans also decreased in q3 and were down yearoveryear net charge offs increased slightly from the quarter and were tied to only one credit potential problem loans also increased with the increases tied to continued pressure in some select covidrelated industries we expect these trends to normalize as we get into for the fourth quarter we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk ratings economic conditions other indications of credit quality and loan value with that i will now pass it back to andy to share some closing thoughts as we look to round out the final quarter of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat on slide we recap our updated guidance for amid the economic headwinds we face in the back half of the year we are expecting full year commercial loan growth excluding ppp to come in at approximately we expect our full year net interest margin to land at approximately due to elevated liquidity levels and compressed commercial loan yields and we expect to finish at the upper end of the million to million range we gave for noninterest income back in september reflecting continued strength in our core fee businesses over the remainder of the year and lastly as i mentioned we continue to experience positive credit trends due to economic conditions as we and as such we expect fourth quarter provisioning to be adjusted to reflect changes to risk grade economic conditions and other indications of credit quality and loan volume and with that wed be happy to take any of your questions question and answer section operator and at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions one moment please while we poll for questions and our first question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question lets see chris i wanted to maybe start with you just on the plan to deploy the billionplus of excess liquidity over the nine months or so can you talk a little bit about sort of your preference for what youd like to buy relative to the current composition of the portfolio and sort of what the interest rate assumptions are or what kind of rate environment will be necessary to be able to hit those sort of targeted reinvestment rates christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so i think the mix overall scott will look a lot like what you see in our current portfolio and wont be a fundamental change from what weve been doing for the last couple of years just adding a little more volume and from a yield perspective weve called out that we think that reinvestment portfolio yields will be in the plus range which is consistent with what we purchased in september r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and currently available associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co excellent so it doesnt depend on further increase in the long end of the curve or anything like that just sort of static environment would be great christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp a static environment we can achieve and deliver on this investment plan and a great move higher that would be even better r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful okay good and then can you let us know what the remaining ppp fees are that will flow through nii and margin christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so i think we detailed that on slide in the materials and so at the end of the press release table thats what i meant sorry thats million and again we think the majority of that will come off that doesnt mean all of it but just for clarity something probably more than half of it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect yeah sorry i missed that and i think i missed that last quarter as well so appreciate you humoring me so good all right thank you very much christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure operator and our next question is from michael young with truist securities please proceed with your question michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon michael andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey michael associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 michael young q analyst truist securities inc i wanted to just touch base on the commercial loan growth i think youve highlighted a lot of positives in terms of utilization rates moving higher good demand in construction funding moving forward et cetera but then on the flip side maybe moving down the kind of the lower end of the targeted range from month or two ago so could you just talk about whats driving that is that payoffs or competition in the market or demand any color would be helpful andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah this is andy ill take that one as we look at the fourth quarter we have a few things weve had very modest increase on line utilization so far its not been a major driver when you look at the fourth quarter you have to look at mortgage warehouse and what the impact of rates will be to that part of portfolio and then we have oil and gas which we expect to run down and is running down so when you look at all of those pieces together and you see that little bit of a low in the third quarter we believe that drives us down to the lower end of the range but at the same time what i would say is our commercial pipelines remained strong so we feel good about the fundamental business heading in the fourth quarter and we feel very good about the state of our initiatives heading into the first quarter as we get new relationships managers up and running and theyre already taking looks at deals folks we didnt have in the field before so thats the primary driver down for the fourth quarter michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great thats helpful and then just as my follow up chris as rates started to move up especially on the long end of the curve does that change how youre looking at any loan categories maybe like longer duration residential real estate or anything like that that youre kind of looking at differently especially as it pertains to kind of the capital allocation model that youre bringing to bear christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so i would say this i dont think it changes what were looking at differently we had already strategically begun to reposition ourselves in expectation of rising rates gently over time away from mortgage which we have seen less volume and less applications on and which weve said we would hold the balances there static going forward and shifting towards more shorter duration but still fixed rate assets such as the auto such as the equipment finance which are going to come online and are poised to benefit from the repricing and we continue to expect to participate as our customers will in general ci repricing and cre repricing over time michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great indiscernible michael young q analyst truist securities inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 yeah right i got you yeah and thats what i was curious also i appreciate the color thanks christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp shomali do we have the next question in queue andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp shomali have we lost you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp we lost connection do we need to dial in q im not sure if my line is still open but i can still hear you guys if that helps andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp that is helpful and your line is still open this is andy harmening i have some skills as moderator as well and id be happy to take the next question if youve got anything for us happy to answer it q ill throw one out there nothing else to stall just on the network deposits as a factor kind of moving forward into a higher rate environment thats historically been kind of a nice buffer for you guys to pull on when you needed the funding but can you just talk about that again maybe in the context of potentially rising rates going forward and i think were a long way from liquidity scarcity but just as you think about that on a goforward basis christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah weve been able to i mean nicely maintain our core deposits as you can see that weve maintained it at a pretty low level our customer satisfaction coming off of last years those satisfaction scores remained pretty strong which is also a key driver of retention so we believe that the networks are a big positive for us whether thats in community markets that are very they play a very key factor or major metropolitan markets patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so just so were all on the same page the core funding levels have reflected very positive dynamics and the lowcost as andy has articulated the network deposits that come to us from the large mutual fund complexes and the brokerdealers those deposits weve been working directly with those providers to manage those balances down and you see that on slide and how weve managed those balances down associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 but we have endeavored to keep relationships open with each of the large dealers so that should the market come back in a way that would require us to act as incremental funding we would still have good access there and weve tried to manage the largest providers to be the largest remaining components of our current outstanding so that were active with them we remain active in their flow and when the market necessitates that we may need incremental funding we hope well have ready and easy access to those same large providers that support us as we grow in say or when liquidity perhaps starts to take a turn christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think i was taking that from a different perspective which is we have optionality but we also have the strength of branch network deposits outside of additional network deposits that are still available q id be happy if andy could take this next question this is a first for me andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you guys q let me know if you get the operator back but ill guess ill just continue just on share buyback obviously good to see some strong utilization this quarter stocks a little bit higher than where its probably been throughout so just is there still pretty strong appetite there or at some point do you start to lean more heavily on an escalating dividend or do you look at ma kind of how are you walking through the capital allocation bucket andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah im going to this is andy ill take the first part of that and what i would say is our focus is on growth we think thats the best most profitable way to advance the company and so as we head into we feel really good about the trajectory that we have of the initiatives and our core businesses where weve been able to add commercial bankers and small business bankers we felt like we had an opportunity in the short term as were getting that ramped up towards yearend to maximize our capital position and were in position to buy back stock if there is a situation where there is some slowdown then well remain well give ourselves that optionality but our number one priority is growth chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp you said it well first organic growth second maintain a competitive dividend and we think with the actions we took in the third quarter we enhanced our competitive dividend positioning third looking at inorganic opportunities but the internal organic is the key focus there so theyre downplayed for the moment and well always look at share repurchase as a use of incremental capital but frankly with the plans we have for organic growth we have a good use case to deploy our capital in the nearterm towards those initiatives associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you again if theres another question out there q are other people connected or are you guys able to open other lines or we just andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i think that we our moderator shomali has been disconnected momentarily so he cant reposition the line so i think right now others can hear us but you are q okay well ill sit back so others can ask questions if theyre able christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so for our analysts that are online feel free to send your email questions directly in to ben mccarville thats benmccarvilleassociatedbankcom i think most of you have his information handy and well be sure to answer them in queue order as they come along andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i hope you hear from this series of events that were really better at operating a bank than we are serving as moderators but were trying like heck to do it ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp so i will say we have a couple of questions that came through from scott siefers additional questions that came through from scott andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp great ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp and ill recite the first one here so what will be the amount of strategic initiative charges in i think you took million in charges in the third quarter but ive been saying million for full year so million remaining and embedded in the full year guide associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think thats the right way to think about it scott so were changing our were not changing our full guide so that leaves us that amount that youve articulated there as a likely range of outcomes were obviously working through those and well be diligent and disciplined about managing those as appropriately but our total expense guide is unchanged ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp next one from scott what was the linkedquarter increase in potential problem loans this quarter andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp pat patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp so those were really as i mentioned tied to what we call covidrelated industries some movie theater exposure hospitality transportation et cetera its really a handful of select deals that we dont see as a systemic increase over the portfolio it was just really very select credits ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp also from scott what type of wage inflation are you seeing and can you absorb it within your existing efficiency initiatives andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah great question its something were all seeing as you probably noticed last week we noticed we announced a wage increase across our entire footprint effective november that wage increase has already been budgeted for and we believe we have appropriate plans in place for so we can absorb what we see as increases going forward pretty effectively and the good news is weve had very nice success on turnover year overyear relative to other what were hearing in the marketplace ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp okay last question from scott the provision guidance is less specific than usual your reserve is below the cecl day of and i know energy was a portion of that are we done with the negative provisions should we assume that without meaningful economic changes well keep the if it is well keep pace with loan growth christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so this is chris niles let me give a first response to that so weve given the more broad guidance because we think going forward our provision will be more economic and portfolio factordriven that having been said we feel very comfortable with where we are at the end of the quarter we think the reserve is appropriate but we also associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 see some good overall dynamics and we wont be necessarily expecting significant negative pressure over the near term ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp all right our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw what is your expense guidance for q4 trying to get a better idea of impact of prior onetime items christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so our expense guidance is for the full year on a total basis so you can take our total guidance subtract the first three quarters and thatll be the fourth quarter guidance andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think the other thing that to state there is as we launched multiple initiatives what we committed to is having positive operating leverage above the second quarter we clearly did that in q3 and we expect to do that again in q4 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah positive pretax preprovision above the million that we outlined ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp and then we have a few here from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets so first question is when do you think commercial loan yields can bottom out christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp well id like to think they already have now thats a bit over my skis but the reality is were beginning to see market yields generally rise and we take comfort in what weve seen as some of the larger bank syndicated transactions that have come out where they started to build in sofr adjustments and other factors that this perhaps the compression in spreads that weve been experiencing thats driven absolute yields to the bottoms we hope is perhaps behind us and whilst spreads may not expand absolute yield will continue to rise if market levels rise andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i think the other thing thats a tailwind potentially is as we see this slow steady increase in utilization that typically comes with an improved margin as well so its impossible to say on the forwardlooking exactly what bottom looks like but more to come ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp all right so next up from jon are you still planning on billion in auto outstandings by the end of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp were very much believing were on track to be able to achieve that we are three weeks into it we at the writing of this presentation we were at dealers since then i had a call yesterday afternoon and it looks like weve raised that to dealers in the pilot so we are on track for that number and we expect incremental increases in november and december and that will really hit the ground running very well in january ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp also from jon if you exclude warehouse and energy are you more bullish on commercial lending for andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes i mean the simple answer is yes weve brought over some talented relationship managers across wisconsin and chicago so far in a pretty short period of time in addition to that when you think about the markets that were in theyre tailormade for assetbased lending and equipment finance we are looking at deals already in assetbased lending having had the leader in that join us in the third quarter equipment finance we were ramping up quickly in fact i met with our head of equipment finance this afternoon on his first day in the office to talk about how we bring a team around ramping that up as quickly as possible and its a seasoned veteran scott dienes who comes to us from wells fargo and ge capital so those are pieces that we dont have in our numbers today in the third quarter that we expect heading into first quarter we will have and in spite of that we continue to see a really nice pipeline we saw commercial increase of in the third quarter and we maintained a very nice pipeline in commercial even with the closings that we had there so feeling very bullish on our commercial business heading into first quarter and ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp all right so a couple here that i might blend together on jons indiscernible i hope its okay so it seems like the margin should be up nicely in and more broadly when are you willing to talk about your outlook for overall andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well jon weve historically given our guidance in our january call so you can expect to hear from us then but obviously we will be presenting at a conference later this quarter and well perhaps give you a little more update on our strategic initiatives at that time ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp all right so next up we have a couple of questions from terry mcevoy with stephens so first of all how will the fte count change from the day andy joined until the day that your hirings are done with the initiatives christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 sure when you think about the overall fte counts were roughly at in the second quarter in the press release tables were just over now so they really havent changed much but the new hires and the additional staff to support all of our initiatives will raise the overall count by a couple hundred including some backfill open positions that we need to work on as well so you can expect the overall count to go up by several hundred ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp next from terry what markets have you hired commercial bankers in and what markets are still on the drawing board andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well weve hired lenders in chicago weve hired lenders in milwaukee weve hired a couple in northeast wisconsin which we thought were very strong so primarily so far in chicago milwaukee and then northeast wisconsin and central wisconsin we think therell still be opportunity in minneapolis on the hiring front and we intend to keep moving forward on that front ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp the next question that we have is from daniel tamayo with raymond james with the reduction in nim guidance offset by the balance sheet growth how do you think of our overall net interest income growth now relative to a quarter ago can you provide more details from the nim improvement comments you made christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so i think wed refer you to the guidance slide where we also highlighted that not only do we expect to be at the upper end of our fee range but we expect to be within the total revenue range that we had previously provided at the barclays presentation conference and so the difference obviously between the total revenue and the fee guidance is the net interest income so its a fairly robust number and i think youll find it pretty easy to derive ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp our next question comes from ph jonathan robb with wells fargo what is the duration on the securities youre purchasing as you build the investment portfolio also what would the duration go to in a basis point plus rate scenario christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so ph jonathan as i mentioned the mix of securities that were purchasing is very similar to the mix of our current portfolio therell be a little bit longer duration on the new mortgages purchased than the existing book obviously but similar duration on the munis and so that will be a little lengthening a little bit beyond sort of the five year that youve seen from us historically but not much associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 and with regard to what that would do in an up basis points rate shock i dont have the immediate number at my hands but suffice it to say with a fiveyear duration a basis point shock is mathematically about a point swing in value that having been said im not seeing anything in the 10year yield profile or the forwards that would indicate thats a consensus view ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp all right i have a few more questions here in my inbox but if you have any others feel free to send them along here moving on we have a followup from terry mcevoy with stephens according to other banks mortgage yields are less than auto yields but auto is a nonrelationship business how would you respond to that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp what i would say right now is our mortgage book consists of both originated and thirdparty originations and so the thirdparty origination expansion is not necessary for us and theres opportunity on the indirect auto portion of that to get a yield that is better than what we had before so from an associated bank standpoint it puts us in a really good position in a market that has seen the downturn probably in mortgage origination across the industry in to quickly transpose that but id point out that we have pretty significant expectations in very customerfriendly relationship businesses of small business and commercial banking and that was on purpose we believe those are massive deposit engines and in addition to that we have an initiative that we havent talked as much about and thats the mass affluent initiative which provides typically to of a retail banks deposit base so we have an upside in gathering deposits from those customers as well so in terms of what it means for us its a bit of a mix switch out and a trend on mortgage while simultaneously having to plan around deposits on mass affluent and entering very heavy deposit industries of small business and commercial banking middle market ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp great all right and then we have two remaining questions next one is from scott siefers at piper sandler so you had suggested a steady state nim over three plus years with your september strategic initiative announcement do you still feel comfortable with that expectation in light of how long excess liquidity is sticking around andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well i think the question on excess liquidity look theres some indications that typically when you see some spend and you see some account fee increases thats typically a leading indicator that something that there may be a decrease in deposits over time were seeing that so absent stimulus while those have been sticky for us through three quarters and have been through the whole entire in the entire industry heading into i think theres some signs of that being a decrease so overall right now i would say that we are still committed to that the margin that we laid out in our midterm plan associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2021 ben mccarville a vice president directorinvestor relations associated banccorp and that actually was the final question that we had in queue so if there are no further questions andy i think i pass it back to you to wrap up andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well ill say two things thank you for being with us today and thank you for your perseverance in getting through
