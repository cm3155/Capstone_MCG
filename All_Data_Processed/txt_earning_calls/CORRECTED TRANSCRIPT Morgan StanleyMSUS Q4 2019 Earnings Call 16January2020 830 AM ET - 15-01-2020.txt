16jan2020 james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thank you sharon good morning everyone thank you for joining us was a strong year representing one of the best in our history results were within our target ranges with contributions from each of our business lines jon will discuss the details of in a moment but first let me take you through our annual strategic update presentation please turn to slide i think about our firms transformation in fiveyear increments over the first fiveyear period we worked aggressively to clean up the issues from the financial crisis stabilized the firm integrated smith barney into our franchise and reset our strategy over the next five years weve made significant investments in our business around digitalization technology talent and the balance sheet we grew revenues by while we managed expenses tightly doubled net income and materially increased capital return our rotce now stands at nearly and eps has more than doubled excluding intermittent discrete tax benefits today we will discuss the next phase of our evolution the goal continues to be to shift our business further emphasizing more durable sources of revenue within institutional securities and from wealth and investment management the continuation of this evolution should by design help support a base level of profitability during periods of market disruption drilling a little deeper into this throughout this decadelong journey we defended and expanded our institutional securities footprint which we show on slide our brand is closely tied to our institutional presence and leading integrated investment bank our premier institutional franchise remains a key competitive advantage which has allowed us to take share and grow revenues despite a shrinking wallet at the same time the contribution from wealth and investment management continues to grow as shown on slide over the last five years weve increased the profitability of our wealth management business while still making investments in the us banks and our modern wealth platform of particular note or nearly of business days we have revenues greater than or equal to million nearly times that which it was five years ago we also invested in our investment management platform we put together a new growthoriented leadership team and focused on clients solutions and new products we highlight the growth in longterm net flows which reflects strong longterm performance with combined revenues of approximately billion our wealth and investment management businesses are among the largest platforms in the world and now we have an untapped opportunity to further scale our wealth management channel through our workplace offering meeting these ambitions for future growth would not be possible without a strong culture and a cohesive team on slide we describe our culture and the tenure of our leadership team we have an eightyear track record of stating and meeting various public goals we continue to invest meaningfully in our culture and diversity efforts to ensure we remain an employer of choice for our top talent and further morgan stanley has been at the forefront of sustainable finance we founded our global sustainable finance group over a decade ago with the mission to accelerate the adoption of sustainable investing across capital markets i want to spend most of my time providing a bit more detail about the future opportunities were excited about and that we see across our franchise across our segments we have platforms with scaled benefits and were positioned for growth lets start with institutional securities on slide our institutional footprint and franchise is extremely strong in the face of a declining wallet weve gained share over the last five years across our institutional businesses and we have reason to believe these gains are sustainable our business has benefited morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 from the stability of the leadership and commitment to a global client footprint we expect to continue to hold and gain share across the division on slide we take a deeper look at wealth management marks a new chapter in our wealth management strategy the significant investments we are making in the digital space the acquisition of solium position us to efficiently service the mass affluent population and capture new clients and assets through the workplace moreover we can leverage the corporate relationships weve built through our institutional offering as we look to add new corporate clients weve completed the morgan stanley at work offering to span beyond just shareworks by morgan stanley our stock plan administration platform were enhancing and investing in our financial wellness and retirement offerings this more fulsome suite of products allows us to deliver services to an even larger base of employees and this will help ensure that our touch points are not limited to stock plan participants as illustrated on this slide were continuing to win new mandates the combination of the stateoftheart shareworks platform and the morgan stanley wealth management capabilities is being very well received in the marketplace we expect to fully convert all of our existing corporate clients to the morgan stanley work model by the end of todate nearly of those plans on the legacy morgan stanley system have been transitioned to shareworks and the remainder will be accomplished by yearend and by the end of individual employees of our corporate clients will gain access to financial coaching exclusive educational content and our selfdirected brokerage offering providing them with an introduction to our wealth management services over the next five to seven years we expect to convert over million employee participants to either wealth management digital or advisory channels adding to the more than million client relationships we have today well be able to provide a compelling offering for all our relationships servicing the ultrahigh and high net worth segments with financial advisors and more mass affluent clients with our virtual advisor or digital solutions moving to slide weve been clear that we believe that supporting advisors with cuttingedge technology and enabling them to deliver unique product and set of services to clients will be our competitive advantage going forward the investments we made with our digital initiatives have been embraced by our advisors and anecdotally these tools are supporting asset consolidation additionally of course weve seen over billion of asset flows in advisory over the last four years and continue to believe that at least half of our client assets will migrate to advisory over the mediumterm lets talk about investment management on slide the asset management sector is both very large and extremely fragmented lending itself to opportunities for growth in areas where we believe we can deliver differentiated value to our clients and to me one of the most exciting things weve done to capture this opportunity is product innovation illustrated by the number of new products we have developed these products have broadened our revenue base made us more relevant across the client spectrum and translated into material revenue and asset growth since weve launched many new products successfully leveraging our global client franchise weve already seen significant contribution from these products generating billion of incremental assets under management and almost million of incremental revenue in versus these strategies continued new product launches and investments in our client franchise more broadly will be a very important component of future growth another key driver of growth is our existing diverse alternatives client franchise you see on slide our alternatives client platform is at scale and there is strong secular growth in private alternatives in addition to new private alternative product launches noted on the prior page were seeing strong organic growth in our existing high performing private funds for example our infrastructure number three fund which closed in the fourth morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 quarter is over larger than infrastructure two raising billion of institutional capital versus billion respectively further we continue to see very strong organic growth in our premier institutional core real estate strategy our alpha products across both private and public markets as well as our worldclass global solutions capabilities will be critical contributors to investment managements revenue growth in our public active equity strategies our strong performance in global client footprint has driven robust net flows we believe we rank number one in organic growth since among the top publicly traded active equity managers lets turn to slide we expect that these and all our other growth initiatives along with expense discipline will drive further rotce expansion in we communicated that we believe we were capital sufficient and since that time weve continued to deploy our capital to meet our strategic objectives we look forward to the transition to the new capital regime and expect morgan stanley will be able to return excess capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for future growth our robust capital position will enable us to pursue opportunities to invest in the franchise and return capital were confident in our ability to deliver twoyear rotce expansion of to ill conclude with our updated strategic objectives the targets we expect to achieve in as well as our longer term aspirational targets are shown on slide we have meaningfully and with intent transformed this business into what it is today as we execute on the next phase of the firms journey the objectives listed here assuming a normal market environment should result as a natural consequence we believe that in wealth management will be to pretax margin business and will exceed over time this business has compelling scaled benefits between our core competency of serving ultrahigh and high net worth individuals and our near expansion into the workplace there is clearly room to grow from here beyond wealth management were making numerous investments across all of our platforms to enhance the digitalization of our firm and overall technological capabilities given our scale and other efficiencies we have largely been able to selffund these investments between this and revenue growth we expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of to in and below in the longterm as a result of these and all the other efforts we expect our return on tangible common equity to rise from to in and over the longterm we aspire to have a return on tangible common equity of to given our established track record our competitive positioning and our continued investment into our business we are confident in our ability to achieve each of these objectives i will now turn the call over to jon who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results and then together we will take all of your questions thank you jonathan pruzan chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced a record level of revenues in we had strong momentum through the quarter and finished the year on solid ground in the fourth quarter firm revenues were billion increasing sequentially contributing to full year revenues of billion fourth quarter pbt was billion and eps was resulting in an roe of and rotce of in the fourth quarter severance expenses of million related to a december employee action and intermittent net discrete tax benefits of million largely offset each other for the full year roe was and rotce was total noninterest expenses were billion for the year noncompensation expenses were essentially flat to at billion demonstrating our ability to selffund incremental costs related to absorbing and integrating morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 solium and increased technology investments through continued discipline over our more controllable expenses particularly marketing and business development and professional services we continue to actively review efficiency opportunities including optimization of our global workforce through reduced dependence on contingent workers and leveraging our global inhouse centers we also see opportunities for vendor consolidation across the firm over time this focus will result in continued momentum to control our noncompensation expenses and help us achieve the objective that james just discussed compensation expenses increased on a full year basis this rise included severance charges and significant movements in deferred compensation plans as well as increased revenues our full year expense efficiency ratio was below our target now to the businesses our institutional securities business reported revenues of billion marking the best fourth quarter in over ten years results were driven by strength in investment banking especially advisory additionally we did not see the seasonal slowdown in sales and trading or underwriting typical of a fourth quarter for the full year isg revenues were billion slightly below last years record level the compensation ratio for the quarter rose to reflecting million of severance related to the december action and the impact of movements in investments associated with an employee deferred compensation plan after considering the impact of these items the fourth quarter compensation ratio was approximately and looking at the full year again after considering these adjustments the compensation ratio was under dcp created some volatility in this ratio but as we have said many times in the past it has a very limited impact to the bottom line investment banking had the strongest fourth quarter in a decade generating revenues of billion the sequential increase was driven by strength in advisory and seasonally robust results for underwriting overall pipelines are healthy across products the pace of ma remains strong and we would expect the period of activity to extend the global equity pipeline remains robust as many issuers target capital raises in the first half of particularly across healthcare consumer and technology as we said before the conversion from pipeline to realized remains dependent on market condition in equity sales and trading we retained our leadership position and are number one globally for the sixth consecutive year fourth quarter revenues were billion down sequentially strength in the americas was offset by declines in emea and asia in cash we continued to expand our share across regions which partially offset the impact of global market volumes prime brokerage performed well as client activity rose during the quarter with equity markets trending higher and derivative revenues declined sequentially as lower volatility weighed on results fixed income sales and trading produced revenues of billion down from a robust third quarter we continue to deepen our relationships with our client base results were driven by strong performance across the credit complex micro produced another solid quarter with well diversified performance healthy levels of client engagement supported results we continue to invest in our secured lending businesses which performed well and witnessed increased client interest from commercial real estate products balance sheet velocity remains a focus in this business and on a fullyear basis improved from the prior year macro results declined versus the third quarter due to lower client activity commodities revenues also declined sequentially however client activity and further geographical diversification of the revenue mix supported results on a full year basis fixed income was up strong performance in micro outweighed the decline in macro where a difficult environment weighed on results in fx and rates morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 turning to wealth management we reported fourth quarter revenues of billion and pretax profit of billion resulting in a pbt margin for the quarter of strong revenues were offset by higher seasonal expenses as well as a million severance charge which had an basis point impact on the margin on a full year basis the pbt margin was representing basis point expansion over last year the business continues to illustrate the benefits of scale while investing in this business and absorbing the solium expenses noncompensation expenses declined from transactional revenues were million up sequentially results were principally driven by gains in investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans as well as improved retail engagement asset management revenues were essentially flat versus the prior quarter on a full year basis asset management revenues were also flat as a large market decline in q4 impacted first quarter results total client assets of trillion increased sequentially and versus the prior year reflective of broader market movement over the last several years we have seen net new assets of approximately of beginning period client assets while these flows are an indicator of the health of the business we continue to believe feebased flows are a more relevant driver of nearterm results we had billion of feebased flows in the fourth quarter a record the shift towards advisory continued and feebased assets now represent of total client assets up from last year loan growth continues to be strong across products lending balances increased to billion or versus the prior year we continue to see strong receptivity in our lending offering our investments into technology have better enabled our advisors to identify clients who would benefit from our lending product suite this has been especially effective in securitiesbased lending we expect to continue so see strong receptivity resulting in loan growth of midsingle digits in total deposits rose sequentially within our bank deposit program we have seen stable deposit level since may with a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter we continue to invest in new banking products and our high yield savings product has also continued to gain traction our new money savings campaign has raised close to billion since its march launch net interest income was in line with last quarter on a fullyear basis nii was up slightly including the impact of prepayment amortization over the next year we would expect the full impact of 2019s three rate cuts the realization of the forward curve and the continued diversification of our deposits to offset the benefit of our lending growth as james discussed we will continue to invest in our workplace offering and also build out our us banks to drive further growth that being said we would expect the margin to rebound nicely in q1 from its fourth quarter seasonal low investment management reported revenues of billion in the fourth quarter for the full year revenues were billion representing a billion increase from the prior period total aum rose to billion of which longterm aum was billion we continue to generate strong positive net flows across major high conviction active strategies longterm net flows were billion the strongest in eight years and we had another strong capital raising year capped off with the close of our billion infrastructure iii fund asset management fees of million grew versus the third quarter recall a significant amount of performance fees are recognized in the fourth quarter performance fees for the quarter were driven by strong results in our core real estate strategy and management fees increased on higher average aum on a fullyear basis asset management fees increased to billion investment revenues were up million in the quarter and billion for the year this line is primarily driven by carried interest which is earned from clients who are invested in our private funds the increase this quarter and year was primarily due to an underlying morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 investment ipo subject to sales restrictions within an asia private equity fund this event generated a significant amount of accrued interest revenue the ultimate realization of which will depend on the monetization of the underlying position in the fund as we have previously said this line is lumpy other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy equity method investment and a third party asset manager total expenses increased sequentially in particular higher compensation costs are reflective of higher accrued carried interest compensation which was primarily related to the event i just discussed non compensation expenses were driven by higher bce expenses related to the launching of new products and reflecting our continued investment into this business this business continues to grow and we expect it will be an increasingly meaningful contributor to total firm earnings we continue to look for organic and inorganic opportunities to grow this business and to effectively meet the needs of our clients during the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately million shares or billion of common stock and our board declared a dividend per share after considering million and million of intermittent net discrete tax benefits our tax rates were and for the fourth quarter and full year respectively we expect our tax rate to be slightly higher or approximately to and will exhibit some quarterto quarter volatility taken in full we are pleased with the firms results this year we enter with asset levels at new highs healthy pipelines constructive markets engaged clients and a rightsized expense base with that we will now open up the line to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much just curious within your twoyear objectives particularly on the rotce what capital return assumptions are incorporated into that is that steady state now or any changes from what weve seen the last couple years jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley well again just from a technical standpoint since we havent seen the new proposals which we think are forthcoming its sort of hard to say what the future return profile looks like other than it will be consistent with what weve done prior until we have more information glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay fair enough on the gain in investment management i guess ipo out of a private equity fund im assuming theres a standard lockup and illiquidity discount can you tell us what that company is so we can track it so we dont have surprise ups and downs every quarter morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley ill give you some more information on that but first id clarify there is no illiquidity discount there the company is public and its marked to the stock price on a daily basis and you mentioned it is in the asia one of our asia pe funds it was an investment we made more than six years ago or the fund made more than six years ago into a china consumer products company the company has been quite successful and grown quite nicely and it went public in the fourth quarter on the hong kong exchange and the ipo has performed quite nicely to give you some sort of context around the round numbers the investment that we made was less than million and the current investment value is approximately billion so we have not only the carried interest we also have a small lpe investment in the fund and so the ownership and carry is going to be fluctuating until we have the underlying investment monetized so as of today were comfortably above the preferred return threshold in that fund but as i said before its an unrealized gain so it will have more volatility if there is volatility in the stock price so just to sum up given the size and given that its public we would expect a little bit more volatility in that investment line in im and we would also expect corresponding volatility in the im compensation line as the investment team has about half of the carry typically operator thank you our next question comes from christian bolu with autonomous your line is now open christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning maybe a question on wealth management i believe you recently made some changes to the comp grid that should be beneficial to wealth management margins certainly next year i think the question is longerterm can you keep pulling the comp lever and i guess as i look at the industry and whats happened over the last decade whether its wirehouse consolidation the demise of the broker protocol more client stickiness because of lending and technology it feels like you can do that but id be curious to get your thoughts on using the grid to drive margins over time james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well listen ill take that were not using the grid to drive margins we use the grid to drive behavior to help us do a better job with our clients so most of the changes with the grid over the last decade have been designed to do exactly that they have supported assetbased accounts have supported working with more sophisticated complex clients theyve supported larger producers who have been growing their business so i dont think of the grid as an expense item i think of the grid as frankly what really reflects what were trying to do with the business and the best advisors embrace that and take great stability among the top advisors as a result of that so christian the changes this year were modest but within the changes sort of under the covers there are more significant changes as you move indiscernible effectively from one set of behaviors to another and ultimately the goal is to continue to professionalize the financial advisor workforce which is a fantastic group of people and been transformed in the last decade from producing something like revenue to over million revenue per person and the grid has got to be aligned with their interest as well and thats something andy and the team are very focused on christian bolu q analyst autonomous research morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 okay thanks maybe just to get back to the question i think glenn asked earlier on because the rotce target does stand out the to it does catch ones eye can you just maybe just help clarify like what level of capital you assume do you assume like the absolute dollar of capital level will go down over time and thats how you get to to just itd be great to get that sort of like clarification james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah im probably going to disappoint you christian and not give you exactly what youre going to need for your model to produce that answer we run the business based upon a myriad of things that we see from global economic growth to market share we have in each of our businesses to the capital were using to prosecute our earnings in those businesses our ability to drive efficiencies across the group net of investments that were making and were currently running an rotce around and so the twoyear objectives feel like theres no compelling reason why wed go below that in any individual quarter of course these things bounce around as youve seen in our numbers over many many years but over that time period we think the to is a very reasonable expectation and assuming normal market condition we will deliver on that the longerterm aspirations are really speaking to where we see embedded scale we have in our various businesses what the longerterm growth projection looks like our ability to manage our expenses youll see our noncomp yearoveryear essentially flat this year which and modestly its pretty impressive given that were investing in a lot of parts of the business so if you just roll the math forward and make reasonable capital assumptions you get to those rotce numbers of to there is as always through the ccar and the capital process a kind of wild card how much do you ask for whats the stock trading at when youre doing your buybacks do we increase the dividend are we going to make other acquisitions or investments along the way there are a lot of things that drive the longerterm but what were trying to set when we set longerterm is what do we believe the potential for this business is many many years ago when our wealth management margins were around or we set a target of and i said publicly i thought they could get and obviously we exceeded that and the whole transformation of the business helped on that many years ago we set an roe target of when i think our roe was around or and we were constantly asked on this call when are you going to get there like the kids in the back seat in the car saying when are we going to get there when are we going to get there and we kind of got there and our feeling now is theres no compelling reason with normal economic growth and good discipline around expense management and the embedded scale in our businesses and the strength of the culture why these returns shouldnt be achievable over a longerterm period operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking the question question on the pretax margin target here in wealth over the next two years good to see you guys expecting a nice step up could you talk a little about the market and revenue assumptions embedded within that target and at this point you guys seem to have implied generally especially with your comments just a minute ago james about noncomp flattening out here in that we should be expecting selffunding of an investment and more stability in the noncomp as opposed to the growth of prior years is that fair morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley there is a couple of questions in there i think when we think about our budgets we generally use sort of consensus views on markets and rates and thats what weve done here the to margin target as you said is a nice improvement and continues to trend it also gives us the flexibility to continue to invest in this business which we will continue to do around our shareworks platform and the morgan stanley at work weve done a lot of work around the digitalization which james talked about which is critically important to the customer experience and the client experience and well continue to make investments there and so i dont think theres any outsized expectations around markets or rates just what we see in the consensus view going forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i think brennan i think that weve finished the year at obviously fourth quarter and somebody will probably ask us about it so ill address it right up was and change there is some seasonality we had some severance expenses in there dcp and other stuff as i said before these things will bounce around quarterto quarter i cant guarantee where the first quarter is going to be the second quarter third quarter but over a full year were at with normal economic growth what weve done with the business i think that id be disappointed if were not at that id just put that out there can it be higher than that thats why we put a range on it do we think its going to be over the next two years no we do not and i think weve got to be responsible when we set these targets about what we think is a likely outcome not a three standard deviation outcome what is the likely outcome and coming off a margin i think the year before approximately its kind of grinding high why is it grinding high well as you bring incremental revenues in the incremental margin on the incremental dollar revenue is higher than the embedded margin so were growing higher brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure sure that makes a lot of sense clearly solium should also the solium acquisition and integration should also help too appreciate that i think you made reference james in those comments to what the underlying margin might have been in the fourth quarter i know i think jon you said basis points from severance and wealth so that gets you to there was some dcp but i dont think you talked about what impact that would have had on the wealth management margin if you can please let us know that and just a request maybe i know it doesnt impact the bottom line but the dcp creates some noise around some of the underlying metrics which makes it it can blur investor visibility into the underlying trends itd be really helpful if you could disclose that or consider disclosing that going forward jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah so just i appreciate the comment and we continue to give further thought to that but we do give a reasonable amount of disclosure in the k around that we try to highlight it to you when its a meaningful contributor based on meaningful swings in the marketplace across all the businesses as i said before the pbt impact is not material generally speaking of revenue versus of comp expense your fourth quarter comment though we generated i think you said with the basis points wed be at obviously wed be at and then by definition when you look at all of these ratios they are negatively impacted by that dynamic effectively one for one its not precise but thats what we to simplify have been using and again appreciate the comment and well give it some thought but we obviously feel very comfortable with the new targets that we laid out at to on that margin morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley and brennan you make a good point it creates noise i mean i remember the old days when we used to have to deal with ph tba on these calls which would move i think one year it moved billion and that sort of bizarre impact it had on our financials fortunately we managed to clean that up the dcp i mean the funny thing is its kind of a good news story right you actually want it to be messing with the numbers like this in a positive way because it means the stock has done well which people invested in and the markets are doing well this was a year where indiscernible was up and the stock was up so pretty unusual year and thats why i think were seeing the outsized on this year i wouldnt i mean listen if that happens in ill be delighted and i dont mind the noise if we get that outcome but ill leave it to the accounting and controlling team to figure out what the right disclosures are but thats where we are operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so appreciated some of the additional disclosure on the wealth management conversion targets from shareworks certainly thats an area where theres significant interest post the solium deal i recognize its a five to sevenyear goal so you certainly have a lot of time to execute on that conversion target i was just hoping that you can maybe help us frame how we can think about either the incremental revenue or even just aum growth opportunity over that horizon if you ultimately execute on that goal and just separately do expect the pace of onboarding to be somewhat linear or is it going to be backend loaded jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley let me try to answer that i mean a couple of things one first of all we had solium was only in our results for eight months this year i think we mentioned before that it was dilutive to pbt so obviously dilutive to margin well have the full effect of the acquisition this year which will also be dilutive to margin and to pbt and then we would expect it to turn potentially pbt neutral or positive and then to build over time and improve the margin the conversions there are several stages as james mentioned theres just making sure that we get all of the corporate clients on to the shareworks platform thats accelerating that should be done this year and then integrating it into the morgan stanley at work morgan stanley at work platform will take another year i think well see sort of an acceleration a slow build if you will of converting our morgan stanley at work clients into either the digital or advisory channel but we think a million incremental customers on our current base would be quite attractive and a real nice growth engine obviously the potential for the different dynamics around the size of that client ie whether its mass affluent versus ultrahigh net worth or high net worth will have an impact to asset levels and cash levels and net new assets but again incrementally if we think we can bring on another morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 million customers in five to seven years on top of our current existing base its why were so excited about the opportunity steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just one followup for me i was hoping you could speak to some of the underlying assumptions just specifically on the macro and maybe industry fee pool outlook particularly on trading and ib just supporting some of the near and longterm return objectives jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley im sorry trading what did you say james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley and ib jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley oh and ib steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc trading and investment banking fee pools as well as just some of the underlying macro assumptions underlying some of the return targets jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah again so i think that well obviously have to see where the pools come out this year when everyone finishes reporting and we get the data it looks like the pools are pretty stable i think from a budgeting not i think from a budgeting standpoint we generally think about those types of pools growing with sort of gdp so sort of very limited or sort of a couple percentage point type growth in the pool and then we couple that with our view on investment dollars and share points so thats generally the macro backdrop that we use for the budgeting which well obviously track the consensus views on gdp and us growth and so on and so forth james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley id just add i mean we dont talk ironically as much about the institutional securities business which has sort of been our core and our lineage since our founding years ago but in each of the we have a slide in there that shows in each of the five businesses debt underwriting equity underwriting advisory ma equities and fixed income they were able to gain share over that fiveyear period and this year they delivered their fourth consecutive billion revenue quarter and weve never had a year where weve had billion billion quarters i mean what this business has been characterized by at least one and sometimes two pretty volatile and difficult quarters each year morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 now we cant and its obviously more vulnerable to market swings but i think what the team has done in balancing out the business ted and the group have made it a much more stable organization i think within fixed income the way thats been turned around with stability that sam and his team i see it gives us more comfort that weve got a lot more stability embedded in the business from prime brokerage financing through to the ma which remains very stable obviously youre going to have volatility but we think these shares are sustainable some places we could grow share but its really a function of stability is what im very focused on for this business because the capital on the balance sheet shall we say is stable it stays there so we need the revenues to be stable and thats what they delivered operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc im wondering if your minimum targets are high enough slide through highlight what you expect institutional securities the fiveyear share gains continue wealth management you increased clients there by onethird albeit over a longer timeframe investment management you have new products you have digital initiatives noncomps flat its all going well and you reported rotce last year and youre looking for a minimum rotce of so why not raise that minimum floor james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley mike we now go back a long way and id have to say youre a model of consistency i think im not sure weve ever had a call when you havent asked for higher targets and its hard to feel defensive when were talking about wealth management margins above efficiencies at 70pluspercent and rotces at to listen our job is to be as transparent and realistic as we can these targets have one significant caveat which is the markets if the world collapses they will be very difficult to meet and we will not be the only financial institution struggling with meeting whatever public targets they have out there we dont run this place on the basis the world is about to collapse and we have no evidence that is going to be a difficult economic year difficult politically potentially geopolitically but certainly the economic outlook remains very very stable so when we do the math and put the targets together we do it based upon a balance between what is our downside in a normal scenario and what is a realistic upside over the nearterm longerterm thats great thats sort of its fun and its interesting and its sort of saying what could we deliver aspirationally and thats probably where your head is in the longerterm part of that chart the righthand side but in terms of running the business and in terms of thinking through our capital deployment our dividend strategy our compensation all of our investments that were making we really focus frankly on the twoyear objectives and what ive always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances the top of the range is obviously a little more sporty so listen i would love for us to deliver on your more aspirational views each year but we cant reliably project that so i dont morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 think we should reliably project it and if you folks want to model in different numbers thats obviously your decisions but weve got to do what we think is right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just a followup slide and one is the expectation to continue to gain share i guess the share gains in the european banks your expectations for that to continue and then on the wealth management side going to the mass affluent youre going downmarket to the teeth of the schwab zerocommission for wealth and after a number of years of kind of moving back from the lower end clients so just if you could address those two specific areas thanks james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah well i think the word we used was sustainable share we certainly dont see our share going backwards in these businesses and there is clearly in different parts of the institutional business we think we can gain share in certain regions in the world where were looking forward to getting our full china license there and continue to grow out our asia presence for example so i feel good about these share numbers you point out there are different parts of the industry that are going through larger transitions now those kinds of things we were doing several years ago so there is potential share upside no question about that we cant model that because that would be pretty aggressive but you can certainly we certainly affirm that the share we have now is stable normal market environment growth that obviously translates into higher revenues and we think theres some upside on share on the going downmarket i think about it differently and for sure commission pricing has been going to zero in small trades for a long time and there have been examples of that in the digital space for years i think the move that schwab made just accelerated what was something that had been happening for a long time and their business models are not built around their secondary commission revenues that you and i understand i dont think about this so much as going downmarket i think about it as opening up a new segment to morgan stanley there are basically three ways in which people have their wealth managed one is through some sort of advice whether its full service private bank trust bank independent financial planner financial advisors and so on and were very dominant in that space the second is direct digital and there are a whole set of new platforms but there are some very established atscale players in that space and the third is the workplace and the workplace remains there are certain players whove been very dominant in it but we think this is also a very interesting space solium gave us a leg into it we see a lot of financial wellness financial advice financial planning that can be brought to employees if theyre into a default digital account when their stock plans indiscernible for example thats relatively easy for us to drive on a digital and direct platform so i see it lets sort of characterize it as going downmarket and more characterizing as just expanding the universe of clients there are a lot of people out there working companies making good money through these share plans they do not want or need one of our large financial advisor teams thats for sure but that doesnt mean they cant have access to what morgan stanley can deliver operator thank you our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 good morning i realize you dont want to give all the details on the expense adjustments related to deferred comp but i guess im trying to get a sense of the kind of full year efficiency ratio of as i think about kind of getting the it would be helpful if you could give us kind of the clean base for this year either now or i guess was probably coming in the k but it would be helpful just to get that base and i guess my question is if you dont want to do that really just as we think about the efficiency improvement can you just elaborate a bit on the drivers obviously its a little bit of revenue growth as you talked about a little bit of growth in wallet and some of the efforts in wealth but just maybe elaborate on is there opportunity to bring the comp rate down and on the noncomp is it about keeping it flat or maybe some opportunities to cut on an absolute basis thank you jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley so i think ive given in the comments and weve given the comments and we hear you on the dcp so im just going to focus you can see from our targets that weve lowered the efficiency ratio we had a little bit of severance in there and again the dcp adjustment would be would also impact that ratio slightly but i think when we think about expenses and expense discipline were talking about expense discipline across all categories of expenses both comp and noncomp we allocate resources at the firm level which is why we have a firm efficiency ratio target some of these ratios get a lot of attention to them when they are if you think about the comp ratio with an isg thats only or less than of our comp versus the totality of the firm we constantly have been focused on being disciplined on comp and noncomp what we will say is that we have been disciplined on comp if you the only thing that we continue to try to do and we have done quite successfully is to pay our people competitively across all of our businesses as we try to attract and retain talent but were disciplined across all those categories when we get to the noncomps weve been very focused on professional services as weve grown our businesses and weve grown some of the digital and technology and digitalization of the firm as well as complying with the regulatory agenda we relied on sort of contingent workers and consultants to help us build that this practice and as all of that has matured and turned more into bau weve been able to rely more efficiently on employees which is why youve seen the head count grow even after the december action and so weve been able to take out some expenses there and optimize the workforce i mentioned vendor consolidation weve done data consolidation in the past so were constantly looking for opportunities in the noncomp space to continue to selffund and drive efficiencies and those types of categories are the ones that i would say that well continue to focus on in the future and we have finally seen some productivity gains around the significant investments that weve made in technology and digital and thats led to some of the actions weve taken as well james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i would just say something about the comp ratio and i think its important to say it years ago when we started on this journey the isg comp ratio was i think if memory serves me and wealth management i forget what is but it was well in the and we had a longterm aspiration again i think wealth management down to and ultimately isg to the last time we publicly set a comp ratio goal for isg i think was in which was and weve managed in the last three or four years to be under that sometimes this past year was a little higher and we had some stuff going on as weve all talked about but we also have started moving weve had a lot of contractors and contingents around the world working for us tens of thousands actually and weve decided as part of our restructuring offshoring weve moved some of those folks in as permanent employees more stability with that for a lot of reasons i dont need to go into it on this call that then becomes part of the comp pool so i dont want to be tied to a comp ratio when were really managing the firm for overall expenses thats what were going to manage for and theres a reason youre not morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 seeing new comp ratios in these numbers but youre seeing a pretty aggressive efficiency ratio we want the ability to manage the firm for shareholders on best basis and thats to have the best people working most efficiently so you will not see youre never going to see comp ratios in the in isg again thats just were not going to do that but we just want to maintain flexibility to run the business and not do goofy stuff like not make contingents employees because were worried it will affect the comp ratio when in fact it brings down the noncomp ratio so thats were going to run the business on that basis and weve been doing that for a couple of years but i just wanted to be explicit about it matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful color thank you operator thank you our next question comes from michael carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning just a quick one for me just in investment management you guys have done well from product development and kind of growing that business it does seem like on the private side its more of your assets we can see it in the performance fees in the carried interest i dont know if you can quantify maybe how much of the aum now you had the potential to generate carrier performance fees just something thats obviously hard to model but you also probably dont get much credit for it just because we dont have kind of the magnitude of that so any more clarity around that would be useful jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley i would again the different categories that we break out obviously the alternatives generally are where were going to have carried interest or performance fees we tried to give you some more information on that in this deck and again its hard to model because as we said theres some lumpiness to it but weve had some really good performance across all of the strategies within im weve also seen stable fee rates across the platform so as aum has grown weve seen that feebased revenue number grow again a yearoveryear comparison that was up which was quite healthy in this industry given what youre seeing across the complex so again weve tried to give you the information to do it but even with perfect information these things are very difficult to project and model out michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks a lot operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is now open steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi guys this is steven duong in for gerard are there any products product areas within your businesses that youd like to complement with acquisitions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i dont think i dont know that we can really talk about products and acquisitions i mean most of the product gaps we have we try and fill organically acquisitions we tend to do for broader strategic reasons either build scale in the business open up a new vertical expand geographically rarely would we do a significant acquisition or even a small acquisition on a pure product its more platform or business unit so i think the short answer is no steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right understood and just last question we appreciate your targets for the next couple of years recognizing that you guys have changed considerably since the last time weve had a sustained bear market can you share with us the tools that you had used to mitigate revenue shortfalls that are likely in a bear market to try to help reach these goals should a bear market occur the next two or three years james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley expenses yeah i mean basically thats your tool right good news is with a bear market your stock is low youre buying back more shares your eps is growing because your share count is down our share count peaked at about billion and were around billion now so we bought back i think nearly million net shares last year when the stock was trading around a couple months ago so that was a little gift that god gave us so i think its just very its very hard to fight the market if youre in a sustainable bear market you got to restructure your organization to reflect that youve become smaller more nimble and more efficient and we and all our competitors would have to go through that you cant plan the business based upon a bear market obviously youve got to plan the business based upon a normal market not a bull market and thats where we set our goals from but as ive been very clear and ill finish on this note these goals are always subject to a normal market environment if we have an abnormal market environment one way or the other then the numbers will be what theyll be but they probably wont be whats on this
