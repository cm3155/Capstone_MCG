transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and good morning thanks everyone for joining us today despite the exaggerated noise from the recent crisis that has largely subsided our second quarter results reflect strong trends highlighted by strong asset quality and overall portfolio health strong and consistent fee income that helps us navigate this elevated interest rate environment continued yet prudent opportunities in loan growth particularly in commercial and in industrial lending strong client engagement and traction across our diverse lines of business these solid results in several areas were masked by a higher interest expense driven by the federal reserves monetary tightening actions and the resulting increases in funding costs in the interest rate environment we live with today as noted in our last call the deposit pricing pressures the industry is experiencing is not dissimilar to the price of commodity or raw materials for other industries as other industries would we are reacting to our cost of raw material by pricing our products for this environment as we have noted of our existing loans also repriced with movements in rates like others in the industry we also maintained elevated levels of excess liquidity during the second quarter this resulted in brokered cds and borrowing levels higher than weve typically carried which also impacted interest expense and our margin to help mitigate the continued impact of liability pricing we maintained flexibility on the asset side of our balance sheet we have a loantodeposit ratio on the lower side of peer averages a largely variable asset base and strategically planned cash flows this is not to diminish the challenges the industry faces from higher interest expense or the rotation of deposits to ratebearing options this has had an impact on margins and spread as evident during this earnings season on the macro front the economy continues to be resilient with some pressures in isolated pockets and industries it also seems that the bulk of the tightening cycle may be behind us and the prevailing questions are how long will the fed maintain rates at these elevated levels and do we end up with a soft landing due to recent industry volatility weve maintained our focus as a growth company weve reported doubledigit annualized loan growth excellent credit metrics solid fee businesses and largely stable and diverse deposit base as our costs increase we remain disciplined in pricing our loans and continue our efforts to control operating expenses the umb has a track record of sticking to the business model that has proven itself over time even as we adapt to changing circumstances now ill cover a few highlights from the quarter gaap net income for the second quarter was million or per share operating net income was million or per share net interest income decreased for the first quarter as strong loan growth and improved asset yields were offset by increased deposit costs and liability mix shifts we have continued to benefit from asset repricing with a linked quarter beta on loan yields of nearly this is in line with the beta on the total client deposits which excludes brokered deposits both the income and expense levels contained a few factors that impacted linked quarter and yearoveryear comparison as a reminder second quarter of last year contained a million pretax gain on the sale of our visa b shares ram will provide more color on the drivers in his discussion we posted average quarterly loan growth of on a linked quarter annualized basis even as weve grown loan balances asset quality remained strong with net recoveries of for the quarter nonperforming loans were just of loans as umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 of june and provision for credit losses was just million for the quarter driven by loan growth and macroeconomic variables we are incredibly proud of our current and historical credit performance if you look at our 20year history ending with the full year of our annual losses have averaged just basis points and our 10year average was basis points what makes it even more impressive is that over these periods we have enhanced our reach and footprint through market and vertical expansion and are generally a more complex organization weve achieved this through our focus on risk management and with consistent approach that comes from having the same team our allowancetoloan coverage ratio further increased basis points sequentially to basis points of total loans a level we believe to be prudent criticized loans were essentially flat from the prior quarter our total watch list levels including past loans will fluctuate from quarter to quarter but as evidenced by our recoveries this quarter we continue to have very little migration to loss the drivers behind our growth in average loan balances this quarter are on slide nearly half the increase was driven by ci customers followed by construction lending and residential real estate while customer sentiment is mixed with some uncertainty about the economy commercial pipeline remained steady total pipeline loan production as shown on slide was million while payoffs and paydowns represent of loans in the first quarter the average for the past five quarters was in line with our longerterm trends commercial real estate and construction growth in the second quarter came in predominantly in the multifamily and industrial categories credit quality is strong across our book and the cre portfolio is well diversified by property classification tenant type and geography as shown in the line of business section of this presentation on slide and as we did last quarter weve included ltvs recourse and other statistics by property type as well as geographic detail on the portfolio the office portfolio represents just of total loans with only an average size of million looking ahead in the third quarter we see opportunities in our various lending verticals across our footprint we will continue to remain disciplined on pricing further emphasizing lending accompanied by meaningful deposit relationships on the other side of the balance sheet average total deposits decreased million or on an annualized basis from the first quarter to billion included in the linked quarter reduction in average deposits were typical public funds fluctuations of million and normal course of business activities such as tax payments as we point out each quarter activity in our commercial and institutional customer base along with seasonal public fund balance fluctuations differentiate us from peers with large retail businesses deposit balances will naturally ebb and flow for typical business purposes including payroll dividends and other activities we have deep relationships with longterm clients who rely on umb not only for deposits but for multiple financial products and services to manage and grow their businesses our pipeline for new to bank deposit relationships also remains healthy and while nominal we continue to add commercial accounts despite the common industry narrative umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 while cost of deposit acquisition will mimic current market rates we also benefit from cheaper sources of funding in our corporate trust and aviation businesses that can be lumpy from time to time to reiterate as i noted earlier weve been diligent and successful in pricing our loans for the market dynamics around our funding costs slide and show the composition and other characteristics of our deposit portfolio at the end of june deposits stood at billion an increase of from march and uninsured deposits adjusted to exclude affiliated and collateralized deposits were at of total deposits as of june now ill turn it over to ram for a more detailed look at our results ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner ill share a few additional drivers of our second quarter results then ill discuss some of the key balance sheet items that continue to be top of mind in the current environment net interest margin for the second quarter was a decrease of basis points from the linked quarter drivers included negative impacts of approximately basis points from deposit pricing and mix and basis points related to changes in fed funds purchased repurchase agreements and shortterm borrowing levels assets included a positive basis points from loan mix and repricing and basis points from the benefit of refunds and changes in liquidity balances the cost of total deposits for the quarter was excluding brokered deposits that we added to enhance our liquidity levels that cost was compared to in the first quarter for a linked quarter beta of as mariner mentioned betas on loan yields kept pace with this quarterly beta we continue to benefit from the shorter tenor of our asset base including the fact that of our loan portfolio reprices within months cycle todate weve seen betas on loans and total earning assets of and respectively similarly the beta on total funding costs which consider the benefit of dda and the impact of borrowing levels has been while the cost of total deposits has experienced a beta cycle todate our outlook for net interest income going forward will be impacted by a variety of factors including the shape of the yield curve anticipated fed hikes along with the timing of those hikes the length of the fed pause timing of rotation out of wholesale funding sources and the replacement cost and potential for any additional disintermediation of dda the ratebearing categories and continued competition from deposit alternatives our dda has averaged of total deposits down from in the first quarter driven both by increase in interestbearing deposits and decline in dda balances the current percentage of dda to total deposit mimics the low point during the to tightening cycle while we do not anticipate any material changes to these levels the migration can be episodic and vary from quarter to quarter due to the nature of some of our business lines a july rate hike seems to be priced in looking ahead to the second half of the year we would expect a terminal beta of for total deposits and for loans through the end of the cycle we would expect some additional modest margin compression in the third quarter driven by the timing of the july rate hike our reported noninterest income of million contained some marketrelated variances including a million decrease in customerrelated derivative income and a decrease in companyowned life insurance income the million linked quarter increase in net investment security gains relates to the umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 impairment of a subdebt security last quarter along with the increased valuation of equity investments this quarter additionally we recognized a gain of million on the sale of some noncore assets in the second quarter the detailed drivers of our million in noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release a few items of note we recorded million in additional salary and bonus expense largely driven by a million severance expense in the quarter and higher salaries related to annual merit increases that were effective in the second quarter these increases in salary and benefits line were partially offset by seasonal decreases in payroll taxes and insurance and lower 401k accruals excluding million of deferred compensation and the million of severance costs as well as other typical timing variances we would put our quarterly starting point expense run rate closer to million our effective tax rate was for the second quarter compared to in the second quarter of the decreased rate was driven primarily by a larger portion of income on taxexempt securities for the fullyear we anticipate that the tax rate will be approximately to now turning to more detail on the balance sheet ill start with our investment securities portfolio shown on slides and our average investment securities balances remained relatively flat from the first quarter at billion excluding the billion of industrial revenue bonds in the heldtomaturity category during the quarter million of securities with an average yield of rolled off the yield on our total afs portfolio increased to and the htm portfolio excluding the irbs that i mentioned had an average yield of for the second quarter the portfolio is split roughly between availableforsale and heldtomaturity and the afs book has a duration of just under years additionally the portfolio is expected to generate more than billion of cash flows in the next months providing further funding flexibility and opportunity to deploy in assets that have more attractive yields the rolloff of these securities which have a blended rate of will also improve our aoci position over that period as of june the unrealized pretax loss on the afs portfolio was million or of the amortized cost for the htm portfolio this loss was million including the irbs slide highlights our liquidity position along with the continued sources of funding available to meet customer and operational needs as of june we had billion in available liquidity sources liquidity coverage of adjusted uninsured deposits increased to at quarterend additionally if needed we have some further capacity to add broker deposits which could boost the coverage ratio to of adjusted uninsured deposits also on that slide weve included our regulatory capital ratios for june our cet1 ratio improved to and compares favorably to the peer median tangible book value per share was an increase of compared to the same period a year ago since we have experienced a annualized growth rate in tangible book value per share our tangible common equity ratio was at june improving to when excluding the impact of aoci we believe our strong capital and liquidity levels provide the flexibility to support our customers grow our business and deliver returns for our shareholders while giving us the ability to address uncertainty in the industry as well as any upcoming regulatory changes that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it over back to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw chris your line is open please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great good morning ram maybe just starting with the top line you talked about little bit more pressure on the margin how should we think about just the level of nii it feels like were the trough was near given mariners growth comments but interested in comments of where you see the cadence of nii going over the back half of the year thanks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ill take that chris mariner and if i just indiscernible weve said in the previous comments mid single digits growth and i think thats probably still reasonable a lot of things a lot of variables both headwinds and tailwinds to shake out for the rest of the year but for what we can see right now that holds true with maybe some the headwinds remain right there persistent see how they play out but its a fair starting place christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just so im clear the net thats midsingle digit is fullyear net interest income growth compared to right ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp correct yearoveryear mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yearover year ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp last years base is about million yeah again a lot of as mariner said a lot of moving parts some of which i highlighted right when the fed is done how long they keep it and what might happen with ddas some big deals that come our way from our pipeline things like that mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean theres as you know because of the institutional and corporate its pretty lumpy we can have a big corporate trust deal come in just as easily as we can have tax payments go out i mean its hard to tell exactly what happens from one quarter to the next christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 okay but that would seemingly imply that the stepdown from q1 to q2 would reverse and youd have growth off of these levels thats my math right thats kind of what your messaging ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp again a lot of moving parts but to mariners earlier point about that midsingle right a lot of these things need to come together for that to happen but im not ready to call a bottom out on nii but at the same time im not saying its going to be much lower than where we are that loan growth is going to be certainly a driver of it net interest income what happens mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp borrowings ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes yeah and with the stepdown from to as we highlighted was a lot of the excess liquidity that we carry the brokered cds that we issued in response to some of the things going on in march mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and those are coming down right as we go into the back half of the year so christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay maybe just one more on your capital your balance sheet is in great shape from a capital perspective i saw the million share in the release last night for the buyback any thought any updated thoughts on capital return given the market seems to settle a little bit mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean the share repurchase approval is to give us that flexibility we obviously dont have any plans to do that but we want to have that flexibility as we watch the stock price in the market and our company perform in the back half of the year im not sure how to ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah and what we did yesterday was the annual cadence that we have for the board to approve some share repurchase authorization typically we have done it in april for million shares and this time around out of prudence and just given the circumstances and the environment we all find ourselves in we just asked the board to approve million share authorization at this point i would say probably not a lot of appetite to do that because we still see loan growth opportunity like weve said our capital stack is largely going to be used up for loan growth mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 yeah thats why the main answer is loan growth thats where the capital is going christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well thanks a lot for the color mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks chris operator operator instructions and the next question comes from nathan race from piper sandler nathan please go ahead your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yes great thank you hope everyone is doing well mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hello nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co a question just in terms of what you guys are seeing from a deposit pricing perspective outside of the portion of the funding basis index to shortterm rates weve heard from some banks that deposit pricing pressures have slowed to some degree more recently curious if you guys are seeing that and to what extent you guys would maybe be more competitive on some rates into the second quarter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well its hard really to predict a lot of that i think from my vantage point i think we are coming to the back end a lot of that to do with what the feds has yet to do still to do yeah i think from our we believe that we went through most of this cycle early right having more of a commercial and institutional deposit base so if what the fed is doing is leveling off which seems to be with an announcement of another today maybe another another so total right the level of increases to the deposit rates for us should be leveling out weve taken most of that pain i believe so that doesnt mean its theyre not going to go up slightly but i just think that the rate of increases is definitely coming off nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then maybe just one longerterm question on the indiscernible mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 sorry i was just going to add that and when it does level off and the deposit increase rates level off we should still see the increases on the loan side nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah that kind of answers my second question mariner in terms of in a theoretical higher for longer interest rate environment i imagine we should see some pretty substantial margin expansion just given the lag and repricing impact on loans and with those shortterm deposits im sorry those shortterm indexed deposit repricing slowing is that a fair way to kind of think about the change to the margin in that type of rate environment mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp directionally yes yes for sure nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay and i understand and appreciate that you guys dont pay much attention to any of your balances versus average but in the period deposit growth was fairly pronounced in the quarter and just curious how you guys are thinking about the pipeline for deposit growth and it sounds like the loan growth pipeline remains pretty solid but should we kind of expect deposit growth to lag loan growth going forward and i think some of the margin or nii lift that you guys are speaking to for this year should be a function of just some of the remix and maybe less deposit growth relative to loan growth going forward or at least over the next couple of quarters does that makes sense mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean i think the way to think about it is in this environment with an inverted yield curve and the attractiveness of money market funds offbalance sheet funds in this environment it is more challenging right to grow your deposits at the rate that we were before the inverted yield curve so we always have the brokered cds and we can always do campaign money to keep up with with loan growth in the short period before the rate cycle normalizes and when that happens we should be able to pick up the deposit rate growth again but i think from the standpoint of umb its important to note that we come into this cycle with a very low loantodeposit ratio so we have a lot of room to run with loan growth without feeling like we are stressing our balance sheet so were sitting with 70ish loantodeposit ratio ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah ph loan mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so we have room to run there during this rate cycle that were in to protect us there to wait for the environment to change and normalize deposit growth ph i hope youd add anything in that comment umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp oh no just i would go back to the prepared comments that we said about the on the institutional side particularly we have an active deposit pipeline that were pursuing so to your question yes its a difficult deposit environment but unlike most peers we have a lot of different sources of funding thats available to us that mariner walked us through so i would go back to what we said in our prepared comments mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i think that i was reacting to his specific question about keeping up with the same rate our deposit growth will not keep up with the same rate we will not grow at the same rate of our loans and were protected by our loantodeposit ratio with that we definitely expect our deposits to grow and i think that to rams point about the nuance of our institutional business as you know from one month or quarter to the next we can have an million million corporate trust piece of business come in and sit on our balance sheet for six or nine months just as easily as we can have a tax payment go out on the other end so thats why we focus on the averages instead at the point in time nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got you okay one last one for me just in terms of what youre seeing from a lending competition perspective i imagine some of the consistency in your pipeline is a function of maybe competitors pulling back that are maybe more liquidity constrained as you guys but would just be curious to kind of hear where you guys are seeing particular growth and whats going on competitively thats also kind of supporting the strong pipeline coming out of the second quarter james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management yeah this is jim rine were seeing plenty of opportunity still and rates remain competitive as they ever have been we have seen competitors pulling back i think its a common theme right now as it relates to banks are looking for full relationship more than transactional lending and if it doesnt come if the opportunity doesnt come with additional funding folks are taking a much stronger look at whether or not they want to take on a particular large opportunity like cre for instance or even participations so especially in the syndication banks without additional fee income or additional deposits are definitely pulling away from those regarding pricing banks are still looking loans and their good credits are still able to command a decent rate mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp marginally were seeing more rates on everything though obviously with the which is why our betas are doing so well we expect as weve been doing in the past we tell you what the next quarter looks like pipelinewise and this quarter coming quarters pipeline looks just as good as last quarter umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president
