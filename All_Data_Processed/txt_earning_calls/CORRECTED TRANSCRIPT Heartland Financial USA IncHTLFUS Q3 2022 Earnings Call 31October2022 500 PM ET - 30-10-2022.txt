mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon as bruce just outlined this was another solid quarter for htlf with earnings per share of loan growth of million excluding ppp strong revenue growth improved core expense levels and stable clean credit trends included in this quarters results were two large items first a million loss on the sales securities and charter consolidation restructure costs of million together these items decreased pretax income by million and earnings per share by i would again remind you that both heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 our earnings release and the third quarter investor presentation are available in the ir section of our htlf website ill start my comments as i usually do with the provision for credit losses which totaled million thats a million increase over last quarter this quarter the provision was driven by loan growth that was heavily weighted towards ci elevated economic concerns and stable healthy credit trends more specifically after five quarters of decline nonperforming loans and related reserves rose just slightly this quarter while loan delinquencies remained low at basis points of total loans nonpass loans declined again this quarter to of loans from last quarter and as bruce already mentioned net chargeoffs were virtually zero this quarter at quarterend the allowance for lending related credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments increased million to million or of total loans in addition at quarter end unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled million or basis points of total loans moving to investments which declined million to end the quarter at billion representing of assets with a tax equivalent yield of and will generate cash flows exceeding billion over the next months we continue to actively manage the portfolio by taking several actions during the quarter first in august we moved million of taxable munis with a market value of million into the held to maturity portfolio second we utilized some of our strong revenue growth to take the opportunity to sell million of securities yielding at a million loss and used the proceeds to purchase new aaarated securities yielding and lastly we utilized million of cash flow this quarter to fund loan growth with regards to capital htlfs regulatory capital ratios remained strong with common equity tier at just over and total riskbased capital at the tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to at quarter end and includes a basis points decline due to the continuing decrease in market value investments which was partially offset by higher retained earnings moving to the income statement starting with revenue net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million higher than the prior quarter the main drivers of the increase were strong loan growth the feds shortterm interest rate increases with only modest core deposit price increases the quarter included of ppp interest and fees which is million less than last quarter we exited the quarter with just under of unamortized ppp loans or fees remaining on our books net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis rose basis points this quarter to due to the recent rate increases and our asset sensitive balance sheet increased asset yields outpaced rising funding costs again this quarter as investment yields improved basis points and loan yields were basis points higher total interest bearing deposit costs were up basis points this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was down basis points from the prior quarter noninterest income of million was million lower compared to the prior quarter excluding security gains and losses core noninterest income was million which was just short of our million to million forecast the main components of the reduction were a million decrease in commercial swaps and syndication fees due to lower loan volumes this quarter compared to last quarter weaker wealth management fees and mortgage banking revenue which declined and million respectively due to the higher interest rate environment and as you may recall last quarter there was a million gain on the sale of visa b shares so in total revenue grew million or exceeding expectations and will continue to grow into heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 shifting to expenses noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter thats up million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses the run rate of recurring operating expenses decreased to million compared to million last quarter and came in within our expected range of million to million most core expense categories were relatively flat or down this quarter with the most significant improvement coming in salary and benefits expense which decreased million the only category with a significant increase was other expenses which was up just under as a result of the strong revenue growth and core expense reductions again this quarter the third quarter efficiency ratio continued to improve down to from last quarter looking ahead htlf significant momentum will continue next quarter and into highlighted by loan pipelines which as bruce noted remain strong and support our expected loan growth rate of to per quarter nontime deposit growth is expected to remain muted in the range per quarter assuming no additional fed rate changes net interest income is projected to grow low single digits on a percentage basis next quarter reflecting continued loan growth and a full quarter impact from the september fed rate increase with some offset from mounting pressure on deposit pricing the next expected fed increase of basis points is projected to increase net interest income by million to million on an annualized basis assuming a normal deposit beta for us of provision for credit losses should remain in the range over the past few quarters of million to million given projected loan growth and assuming net chargeoffs and delinquencies remain near their current levels however further declines in economic conditions and projections could have a significant impact on future provisions should a strong recession begin to materialize core noninterest income excluding investment gains and losses is expected to be in the million to million range per quarter with commercial deposit swap and syndication fees helping to offset lower mortgage banking and wealth revenue recurring operating expenses are expected to remain in the million to million range however inflationary pressures including wage inflation remain challenging charter consolidation and restructuring costs are expected to be between million and million next quarter in total we estimate the remaining costs to complete the project will be million to million over the next five quarters consolidation and branch optimization benefits are already beginning to materialize as evidenced by the basis point reduction in our core expenses to average assets ratio since the beginning of the year and additional benefits will continue to develop over the next months we remain confident that the total consolidated benefits will reach million on an annualized basis when the consolidations are completed in early q4 of and finally we believe a tax rate in the to range excluding tax credits is a reasonable run rate and with that ill turn the call over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc josh we can open up the lines for questions now heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a qa questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from andrew liesch with piper sandler you may proceed andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co some questions here on the loan growth in the pipeline im just curious like how much of this growth and how much of the pipeline consist of some larger syndicated loans that you participate out versus some of the more granular loans that you historically originated bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i dont have the exact number andrew but i would tell you that its a much more granular its more of a focus toward the granular loans and relationships that we would bring on our books versus larger syndicated relationships bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc again i think we only have andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you all right thats helpful bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and andrew we only had a small handful of syndicated loans this quarter and last quarter so most of that growth is our own growth bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right and even in the syndicated heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you great indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc andrew we would be the primary bank and would just syndicate beyond our limits andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co right and then just on this loan growth outlook i mean what are the thoughts on funding it doesnt sound like nontv growth or deposit growth going to be that much so should we just continue to look at it as the cash flows in the securities portfolio and then maybe some cds added on top of that bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah we would start with cash flow from the investment portfolio to fund any shortfalls obviously were working on trying to grow deposits but as we all know thats a tough order in this environment i think we can get some but yeah we likely will have to use some investment cash flow to fund the loans and were willing to do that bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and were able to do that because we still have of our balance sheet in investments and as i mentioned in my comments late in the third quarter for the first time since the pandemic weve actually initiated consumer acquisition strategies in each of our markets andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you then just one question on that million to million of annualized spread income from the upcoming bp hike i mean you mentioned that the normal beta of is that reasonable what have you guys seen so far as far as the beta is concerned bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah our betas have probably been half of that ph its not even a little bit lower so weve we like most other banks have really been holding down the cost and that will probably change well probably catch up a little even from this last move theres probably still some pressure to move rates up and then i would think going forward well be in that to range do what we need to do is pretty much our high when were in a significant rising rate environment andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you all right thanks for taking the questions here ill step back heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc you bet operator thank you one moment for questions our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens you may proceed terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe bruce you described the charter consolidation is smooth thats what ive got in my notes here im wondering could you just talk about feedback from employees from customers and as an outsider looking in just reviewing the quarterly data it really didnt appear to disrupt growth or client acquisition at all but just would be curious kind of what youre seeing and hearing from your seat bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah terry ive got to tell you i couldnt be more pleased with how this has gone as weve always said that we really are great at ma and really this is just doing our own internal ma and the teams and i recognize several of them on the call the planning that we put into this for over six months the employee feedback has been fantastic we havent had any issues there at all there were still using the same systems i would also say the customer feedback has been very positive especially now that they can use where they are either say traveling into arizona wintering they can use our branches there that is a real advantage for them in most cases everybody was able to maintain their routing numbers in a few cases theyve had to change account numbers and thats really where we probably had the most significant issues and it really hasnt been an issue which is required us to get out in front of that and have conversations with our customers and supply them with their new account numbers but very positive its had absolutely no impact at all on our growth and growth strategies it hasnt slowed us down at all terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great to hear when i look at the asset quality and include oreo and performing troubled debt restructuring loans there was an uptick quarter over quarter so im wondering just your kind of what you saw heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 within the loan portfolio and again theres kind of oreo and those tdrs popped up and what are your expectations for q4 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah ill probably let nathan jump in and give you thoughts on that terry so nathan you want to nathan r jones a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah as we look at kind of the npls and the overall oreo weve really i think it really shows that weve made so much headway around kind of over the last year year and a half if you look at our npls indiscernible quarter if you look at them compared to theyre down and a lot of our other credit metrics have improved significantly along the same lines indiscernible are down from by looking at from a dollar perspective almost plus nonpass is down from in to and so we dont expect everything to be a linear improvement we dont see any significant issues as we continue to work through and continue to execute on improving the overall credit quality of the overall portfolio we think its just a little bit of us working through that indiscernible perfectly linear but we continue to put the hard work in and continue to improve the overall portfolio and are optimistic well be able to continue to make positive results in relation to that work bryan anything you like to add back on top of that bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think just related to the tdrs terry theres a couple in there that one i know was a holdover from some of the extensions that we did during covid i just needed some additional help and the cumulative time we just needed to move it to tdrs its making its payments as wed hoped it just needed a little bit more time so it crossed the line into a tdr both of them are rated substandard so theyre getting a pretty healthy reserve in our process anyway so just technical difficulty terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect thanks for taking my questions bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator thank you one moment for questions our next question comes from damon delmonte with kbw you may proceed damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys just wanted to clarify bryan that the guidance on the provision i think you said between million and million assuming no changes for economic conditions indiscernible loan growth and also from what i read in the release that kind of a broader comment about potential softening of heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 credit trends so that was kind of factored into the provision this quarter so do we think about the million to million specifically for the loan growth and that if economic trends continue the way they are we could see a provision similar to what we saw this quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think unless theres a significant change and the main drivers that we use are unemployment gdp and those both went down this quarter from last quarter and so i think if those dont just go down quite a bit we can be right in that range based on the credit quality that weve got going into this quarter with as we talked about the low delinquencies nonpasses in a really good range so itll be mostly a loan growth and then whatever change in economics and then a little bumps here and there that we just normally get as we go through the process damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay all right great and then for the expense guidance did you say you hope to keep it in the million million range bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc correct yeah kind of that core run rate component of it that would exclude those items i talked damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah indiscernible bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc bumpy damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah exactly okay so i guess on that point what gives you confidence of being able to kind of keep things flattish just given kind of the inflationary environment that were in now and other wage pressures that have been a common theme throughout the quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah our ftes are down again this quarter i dont know if theyre going to go down a whole lot more weve done a really good job if you look at our fte trends in the earnings release so i think were at that point were managing that well and we have been providing for a strong year for our bonuses sometimes we get a bump at the end of the year so i believe that weve kind of were in good shape for all that wage inflation is always something were working on but weve been able to manage it through for the last two three quarters i think we can continue to do that heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay great and then just lastly on the margin outlook it seems if we get another basis points later this week that bodes well for you guys as you look out into where do you kind of see the margin peaking as far as like what time of the year do you think you can go through at least the first half of the year with the rising margin or you think you could start to see some ramping of deposit betas that will kind of limit further expansion as you go through bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah obviously the fed will play a big part in that as long as they keep moving we will keep moving up as i said out of deposit beta we still have enough asset sensitivity to cover that if we have to go into say of that if it gets really competitive and we have to do that on deposits then theres audio gap ph were getting to a push theres no benefit for a rate increase bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and i think i look at it game in a little the way i look at it the time the fed stops increasing we probably will continue to increase our margin about one more quarter and then it starts to top out the way that i would describe it bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc because theres lag on the bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc because we have the lag effect bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 we feel very positive about funding our loan growth because of whats coming off of our investment portfolio as bryan already mentioned with billion next year damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay perfect thats all that i had thanks a lot appreciate the color bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks damon operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from jeff rulis with da davidson you may proceed jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon just a couple questions followup on bryan do we have sort of a percent of the million savings that youve earmarked in savings for the consolidation or are you along a path of achieving a certain amount of that already i guess through we have to be completely complete to recognize that or is there a number that you think youve already achieved on that bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah bruce ask me that all the time and its really hard as you know a lot of this stuff and i hate to use the term but indiscernible these expenses are linked to other things but we have been reducing our ftes weve been some of that is our branch optimization so youve got all that going on at the same time but what i look at jeff is that core expenses to average assets and we have taken out a pretty good chunk of the million already in various forms again its hard to figure out how much of that is from the branch optimization and how much is from the charter consolidations theyre happening at the same time but i think i feel pretty good that weve got a good piece of it already in therell be more next year as we continue to consolidate but were doing pretty well i think bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i mean jeff its not quite linear like weve got out of our banks done so have we achieved of the million thats probably not necessarily the way to look at it but with the growth that weve had weve definitely increased our capacity without increasing our expenses so the way i think about it were probably to of the million weve already achieved even though we still have eight or nine months to go jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it no thanks for the detail kind of a lot of puts and takes there but helpful heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and as you said bruce i mean as the transition or the consolidations are pretty smooth that bodes well i suppose for the remainder but just hopping over to the housekeeping a little bit on the bryan i think you alluded to this in the other income line of down linked quarter it was kind of cut in half was that largely just reduced swap income bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah and also thats where the visa b share gain was last quarter indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc million million bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc million yeah bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc million bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and the you do think the swap that kind of comes back some again to offset maybe some of the gain on sale bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think a little bit obviously our loan growth that bruce projected for next quarter is about what we did this quarter but i think weve got some things in the pipeline hopefully that can keep that flat to slightly up bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and i would just say heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and hopefully we can move our service charges up a little bit indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right yeah and in the second quarter i mean our capital markets income we really overachieved we had a huge loan growth and were able to capture not only syndication fees but also some swap fees and were we have more and more customers talking about swapping some of their floating rate debt those conversations have increased fairly dramatically over the last couple of quarters bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc but having said all that i would say that that number of the things that i told you about the future thats the lumpiest number and thats the one that its probably got as much challenge to get into that range and keep it in that range as any of the other numbers that i quoted in terms of what we expect going forward bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc but we feel very good about treasury management fees commercial card fees we have great run rates going there and its not as lumpy but the mortgage business is off the wealth business well see how the billings are because of the way the market rallied here in october bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah well see how it reacts to the next fed cut which sounds pretty certain here of basis points at least here in a week or so jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and i the last one i had just clarifying i didnt maybe i missed it just again the uptick in kind of call it nonaccruals andor oreo did you outline a asset class outside of i think you mentioned kind of healthcare was there anything else in there that kind of led to some of the sequential increase by type bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc no i think the one thing i would say the increase in the oreo is really from a credit that we have talked about for not just quarters years its a workout credit that weve had here in the midwest its a hog operation and i think youve heard us talk about before its now finally made its way to oreo i know that our special assets guys are working hard to try and see if we can get it off the books but bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan do you have any other color on that heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 31oct2022 nathan r jones a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc no bryan articulated well its one weve been working with for many years even predates me here something were hoping to draw a resolution on here shortly jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks guys operator thank you as there
