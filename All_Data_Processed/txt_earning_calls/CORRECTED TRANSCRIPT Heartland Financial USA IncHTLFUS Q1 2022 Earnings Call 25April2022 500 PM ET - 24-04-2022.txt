management team and unanimously approved by the htlf board of directors these strategies are working we are achieving growth by retaining and attracting top talent such as our htlf food agribusiness team adding customer relationships demonstrated by the last four quarters of commercial and agrelated loan growth excluding ppp expanding into adjacent growth markets which weve done in cedar rapids des moines st paul and the western suburbs of chicago we will also achieve growth by consolidating our separate bank charters into a single htlf bank charter this will create operational and cost efficiencies and unlock capacity that supports growth both organically and through ma charter consolidation isnt a goal in and of itself its one of several strategies to achieve our goals of organic growth and growth through acquisitions we can grow organically pursue charter consolidation and potential ma strategies simultaneously internal efficiency and external growth are complementary not contradictory our bank divisions will maintain their brands local leadership and local decision making staying focused on customers and relationships and htlf will maintain our strong and sizable

we are htlf i will now turn the call over to bryan mckeag htlfs chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today by referencing our earnings release which details another solid quarter for htlf with earnings per share reported at loan growth of million excluding ppp and continued improvement in credit metrics but before i go into more detail i would remind you remind everyone that you can find additional information on the quarter in our first quarter investor presentation which is available in the ir section of htlfs website so ill start my comments as i usually do with the provision for credit losses which was a million benefit this quarter which is slightly better than the million benefit last quarter as underlying credit trends remain very favorable highlighted by nonperforming loans which declined by million and loan delinquencies that remained near historic lows at basis points of total loans as bruce mentioned net chargeoffs were million this quarter due primarily to one agrelated credit thats been in our workout group going through bankruptcy for several years a good portion of the chargeoff had been reserved for in prior quarters the economic outlooks used to develop the allowance were upgraded from last quarter but still retain a measure of caution and uncertainty that management deems appropriate for what it views as lingering economic headwinds so at the end of the quarter the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments stood at million or of total loans in addition at quarter end unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled million or basis points of total loans moving on to some other balance sheet items investment balances declined million this quarter which includes a million or about reduction in fair market value investments now comprised of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a modified duration of just over years and generate between million and million of average cash flow per month tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to at the end of the quarter and reflects a basis points decline that was primarily due to the decrease in market value of investments and was partially offset by an basis points increase from higher retained earnings htlfs regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier at just over and total riskbased capital at so the balance sheet continues to be very strong and wellpositioned moving to the income statement and starting with revenue noninterest income or net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million lower than the prior quarter the main drivers of the reduction were first a million decline in ppp interest and fees recognized this quarter at million down from million last quarter we exited the quarter with million of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books and second due to the first quarter having two fewer days than the prior quarter net interest income was million lower in total these two items resulted in a million decrease in net interest income compared to the prior quarter excluding these components net interest income would have been million higher than last quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis remained unchanged this quarter at as expected investment yields improved basis points in addition loan yields fell basis points and interest cost declined basis point this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was unchanged from the prior quarter heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 noninterest income increased this quarter to million excluding security gains and losses core noninterest income was million up almost million from the prior quarter and as strong commercial swaps and syndication fees more than offset some weakness in wealth management and mortgage banking revenues in relation to rising interest rates so core revenue trends were positive for both net interest income and fees and we believe revenue can continue to trend positive throughout the rest of shifting then to expenses noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter thats down million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses core expenses decreased million to million compared to million last quarter and as bruce said unfortunately theyre a little bit higher than we had projected last quarter this miss was primarily in salary and benefits expense which increased million due to higher incentive and benefit accruals that we set in q1 however these accruals are expected to normalize at lower levels as we go forward on the positive side fte counts declined by late in the quarter and we anticipate additional reductions next quarter as we work through initial charter consolidation opportunities offsetting the increases in personnel costs or declines in professional fees advertising and other expenses which were lower due to it and other projects winding down as we approach our initial charter consolidations looking ahead to the remainder of we believe htlf will continue to deliver strong results highlighted by loan pipelines which as bruce noted remains strong and support our expected loan growth rate exppp of to per quarter nontime deposit growth is likely to slow into the range per quarter assuming no additional fed rate changes net interest income excluding ppp is projected to grow in the single low lowsingle digits on a percentage basis per quarter as loan growth will improve earning asset mix and increase earning assets in addition then the anticipated increase of basis points by the fed in may is projected to increase net interest income by approximately million on an annualized basis provision for credit losses are expected to begin to normalize with continued loan growth and net chargeoffs are expected to remain below historical levels for the rest of noninterest income excluding investment gains and losses in total is expected to be flat at about million per quarter with higher commercial deposits swaps and syndication fees offsetting lower mortgage banking and wealth management revenue core expenses are expected to decline million to million into the million to million range next quarter we expect modest declines in subsequent quarters as we manage core expenses lower by rationalizing branches slowing it and other spending and realizing additional cost saves as we move through charter consolidations in the back half of however persistent inflationary pressures particularly wage inflation remain a difficult headwind charter consolidation restructuring costs will ramp up in the coming quarters we still estimate million of remaining costs over the next two years consolidation will reduce run rate costs and create operating leverage for future growth these benefits will layer in over the next two years and we are confident that in total they will reach the million mark on an annualized basis when the consolidations are completed and finally we believe core tax rate of to excluding new tax credits is a reasonable rate for full year with that ill turn it back to bruce for questions heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you bryan victor were now ready to take questions from the analysts if you want to queue them up question and answer section operator all right operator instructions our first question will come from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc all right good afternoon everybody bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc good afternoon terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i definitely dont want to overlook a very good quarter in the outlook that bryan just discussed but i think i still need to ask it bruce internally how are you call it managing the noise created from the group and maybe more importantly how has it impacted client growth at all definitely i think you had new commercial customers last quarter so that didnt seem to be the case but i just want to at least ask those questions bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yes thanks terry so we will not be commenting on the filing or group but to answer your question i mean we are very focused at the htlf leadership level on executing the boardapproved strategic plan and i would tell you that im just so proud of the leadership team for staying focused and maybe more importantly our banks bank presidents heads of commercial to be focused on organic growth new customer acquisition talent acquisition retention the credit quality continues to improve expense control charter consolidation so what i did during the first quarter terry is i went out and i visited five of our banks spent a couple of days in each market i was in california i was in texas i was in kansas city i was in denver i was in montana talking to our teams and talking to customers and i would tell you theyre just focused solely on new opportunities and taking care of the customer and the customer experience and new relationships and i would tell you based upon the results in the first quarter with new relationships and what our pipelines look like and my conversations with customers we feel very confident that we can deliver the million of organic loan growth in the second quarter and it has yet to really affect the banks its clearly an issue that were dealing with at the board level but at the customer level our teams are focused heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you for addressing the topic bruce and maybe a question for bryan just maybe your interest rate outlook if you could discuss new loan yields and what your thoughts are going forward and then on the deposit side how do you think deposits reprice and loan deposit betas as interest rates increase from here bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah good question i think were seeing a little bit of movement starting here now with loans with this first basis points weve seen some move up weve moved up our consumer loan rates and some of our new quotes on the commercial side are moving up as well that should continue as we move up and the fed moves the next basis points i think youve seen though that most banks us included are struggling to get that normal beta when rates go up on the commercial and the loan side so we anticipate then on the deposit side that we will see lower betas and weve been working hard with the banks to hold the line on deposit pricing we think most other banks are doing that and we think that will continue for most if not all of this next basis points terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you both oh sorry bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah and yeah no no no terry i just wanted to indicate that i agree totally with bryan on the first basis points we do think well be more in the normal beta range in the any rate increases after that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator our next question will come from the line of damon delmonte from kbw you may begin damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybodys doing well today so first question bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi damon we are damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 oh excellent excellent so my first question probably for bryan on the expense outlook you kind of guided back down to the million to million range going forward can you just go through some of the puts and takes there of how youre going to kind of come down from the million level from this quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think the first quarter damon unfortunately kind of a couple of things that caught me by surprise i thought we probably could get some of those ftes out that came out later in the quarter a little bit earlier our rsus probably hit a little bit higher in a week first quarter always is a little bit higher for rsus as we have to expend some of those for people who qualify under our early retirement plan so those hit a little bit more in the first quarter we also have people who had bonuses and some of the incentive comp that hits in the first quarter they defer a little more in their 401k so we match a little bit higher so i think all of that is going to kind of normalize as we go and then i do think as we exited the quarter theres probably a few more ftes that will come out so i think all of thats going to help quite a bit we did have just a couple of cleanup things and the occupancy i think will normalize as well presmaller items and then i think its smaller items down the rest of the expense categories that can get us a couple of million a couple million million maybe million reduction depending on how things go bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah damon we feel damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc very confident as bryan laid out that million million in reduction is weve already got it identified and well continue to work hard to even find additional expenses as the teams are working through that damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats helpful thank you and then with regards to the negative provision this quarter i understand you had the resolution of a longstanding ag credit which kind of drove the net chargeoffs but with the growth that youre putting on kind of taking that negative provision and releasing reserves like how do we think about the provision going forward do you feel like youve kind of flushed out any excess reserves that you had and now youre going to have to provide for loan growth going forward or can you just give a little perspective on the outlook for the provision bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say and bruce can jump in and nathan can even jump in here too were down at basis points of loans thats getting pretty close to where we were when we initially implemented cecl so i think were getting towards that end where were not going to have a lot less left to release we do expect the charge off levels to remain historically kind of lower than they have been so that will help so we may have a quarter or heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 two where we dont get fully normalized but i think its going to begin to normalize i think were going to be i could see this ramping up from zero to million kind of ramping up to a more normal maybe million to million type of things we kind of charge forward here nathan i dont know damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc if you have anything to add to that whether you agree or nathan r jones a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i fully concur bryan and nothing i would add at this point damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you and then just my final question just given the size of the securities portfolio with it being over of earning assets and just given the pretty meaningful impact to tangible book value in the tc ratio this quarter is there anything that you guys can do differently to try to soften any future impacts if we continue to have a volatile rate environment bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc there are some things we can do damon at the margin were not at least right now planning to just totally reposition the portfolio that would be very expensive given right now we think were going to work our way through i think theres some things that we can do with the cash flow thats coming off and maybe some other things that that can do that we can take some opportunities but its kind of a tough one because its paper losses i dont think we want to run out and necessarily turn the paper losses into realized losses by churning the portfolio so damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah damon we feel pretty good about the cash flow that comes off at million to million a month so its million a quarter and were able to reposition that right now at about a higher rate than what its coming off and well continue to do that and look at opportunities going forward damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 got it got it okay great thats all that i had thank you very much operator our next question will come from the line of andrew liesch from piper sandler you may begin andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone just a question on the rate environment with libor moving up steadily throughout the quarter i would have expected that we would have seen more improvement on the loan yield side can you maybe explain why we didnt see any yield improvement or is there just a lag effect on the pricing bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc we have some lag effect we have one of the things is weve got floors in a lot of our loans and so we still have call it billion that are still on or below the floor so in other words those have another to basis point increase before they come out of their floor so those would have acted almost like fixed for this period of first basis point increase i think thats part of it andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then i guess what i know you guys have made a push to target larger middlemarket companies was that also some of it just with the lower yields that they garner bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i think theres a little bit of that andrew and thats offset by the credit quality and what were seeing there so there is a little bit of a tradeoff there i think also we were experiencing some of the loans that were maturing and were rewriting them in todays interest rate environment that there just probably the last quarter where theyre coming off higher rates and were putting the new loans on at lower rates so thats some of that timing that we think now will move forward well get the benefit of the increased pricing andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it okay thats really helpful and then just on the agrifinance team that you have in california looks like they had some pretty nice growth how does their pipeline stand ph in their outlook for the next few months bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah their pipeline is just outstanding right now they delivered almost million of growth for us of funded growth during the quarter and that really helped offset as the first quarter in the ag world is normally down as theyve sold off their inventory so we were able to generate that but its a very strong pipeline actually ph in about days were going to go out there for a couple of days and make calls on some of those customers so im really looking forward to that but its very strong pipeline andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 great so thats it for me ill step back thanks bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks andrew operator thank you and our next question will come from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co so that last question may have or the answer may have touched on what i was going to ask on i guess your expectations for q1 growth versus reality much much stronger it sounds like the ag piece was part of it but i guess if i take into account your expectations for q2 growth it seems just net stronger not like a timing thing that production moved from second quarter into the first quarter so maybe outside of that ag being strong what maybe changed from your expectations to the actual net growth that you booked what was stronger than anticipated bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah in the first quarter what was stronger was the nonowneroccupied real estate particularly the industrial and distribution and warehousing that was much stronger than we anticipated we were able to generate some new relationships as well as some of our existing customers expanded their portfolios also medical and life science was stronger and the funded ag piece was stronger because we anticipated because of utilization that the ag book would be a little lower but because of the strength of the agri business group in california they more than offset the decrease in utilization and paydowns based upon seasonality jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it okay thanks for that and just wanted to on the maybe bryan the expense guide i wanted to confirm that the restructuring costs are not included in that or are bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc correct i exclude those this would be what i call core so you take that lumpiness out correct heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and just be it that might be lumpy is there any guess to timing on that the restructuring cost is it bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah weve paid actually in terms of what weve paid weve paid some vendors already they havent started they just started to do their work at the very end of the quarter so thats going to ramp up i think it was about that you saw in restructuring charges again i dont have a great handle on this but i could see that getting into the couple million dollars maybe this next quarter but well see its all really timing and when things progress certainly once we start converting the banks then therell be a lot of activity so jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc timing of that could be a little bit again lumpy depending upon what expense it is jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it okay and bruce last one and really circling back to the first question given the kind of the board noise and i know that youre not really commenting on i just want to kind of circle back on the strategy if i could on capital use is it safe to say theres no change in your preference of the current voice in the room board and management team of the organic versus ma is that steady state or is there any pivot to highlight one or the other currently bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so i think that the way i would describe it is were very focused on the organic side controlling what we can control well definitely be open to ma as we historically have been but as you know stocks bank stocks have been depressed around pricing and so therefore were very focused on again organic growth attracting new customers controlling expenses focusing on continuing to improve our credit and then as bryan has mentioned and i have really working through the charter consolidation although its not one at the exclusion of others if an ma transaction presented itself we would put a slight pause on the charter consolidation to work through that so we think all of them are part of our overall strategy and thats what were focused on executing on jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it i appreciate it bruce thanks heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2022 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yes operator operator instructions and im not showing any further questions in the queue because there are no further questions at this time id
