results this quarter brian will provide details on the trends later in the call and i will provide a highlevel overview here on a core basis which excludes walmart and the yamaha portfolio the impact of covid19 drove a decrease in loan receivables a decrease in interest and fees a decrease in purchase volume and a decrease in average active accounts the efficiency ratio was for the quarter as a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the covid19 impact in our balance sheet deposits were down billion or versus last year this includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth given the excess liquidity we have we have held direct deposits at last years level of billion our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source and we will continue to focus efforts to make our bank attractive to depositors as we navigate the daytoday of this new environment in which we all find ourselves we are also acutely focused on the future of our business during the quarter we extended several programs and added new partnerships which you can see on the slide we also executed a successful launch of the new verizon program we are very proud of this program and we work closely with verizon to create a unique robust rewards program for their customers that use simple and easy tools to apply buy and service the verizon visa card this card includes a compelling value proposition giving consumer wireless customers the ability to save on their monthly verizon bill through rewards earned on everyday purchases and freedom to use those rewards

digitalfirst experience we are also excited about synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 our new program with venmo and continue to partner with them to launch their

are wellpositioned to continue to help our cardholders and partners navigate through these challenging times we continue to remain highly focused on digital innovation accelerating our data analytics capability and creating frictionless customer experiences which are key to the success of our programs and winning new partnerships im going to turn the call over to brian doubles to discuss some of the key highlights in this area brian d doubles president synchrony financial thanks margaret as weve discussed previously the digital transformation has been well underway for a number of years now and in many cases the pandemic has accelerated these trends that were already in motion its clear that many of these new trends and our consumer behaviors will be permanent and there will be a new normal specifically as it relates to the digital shopping experience and consumers increasing demand for contactless commerce and payment options studies indicate that consumers are changing their shopping behavior and that contactless payments is becoming increasingly important as indicated by the data on the slide the fact that consumers are seeking and rapidly adopting contactless solutions is creating greater demand for our partners to deliver safe and efficient contactless experiences we are wellpositioned to address these changing behaviors and have quickly responded to this need with dedicated resources and investments to support our partners and cardholders during this time of rapid change as you know we have been investing in our digital assets and capabilities and we quickly recognized in the early days of the pandemic that we would need to move even quicker to help support our partners and help them accelerate their digital transformation we quickly reviewed every strategic project in the business and reallocated resources and agile teams to accelerate our efforts on key digital initiatives we believe we are uniquely positioned to meet this moment and its lasting effects data shows that the vast majority of consumers plan to stick with their digital behavior beyond the pandemic and we are prepared to help our partners position for the new reality of today and into the future driving digital sales penetration continues to be a key to our success with both existing partners and with our newer programs in retail card digital sales penetration was in the second quarter and digital applications were approximately of our total applications percentage points higher than last quarter the mobile channel alone grew compared to the same quarter last year excluding walmart further more than of total payments made on our cardholders accounts are done digitally we continue to provide partners and customers with increased digital options from applying on their own devices provisioning a new card into their digital wallet transacting with contactless cards and making payments we believe customers will continue to adapt to what makes them more comfortable many of our partners have been with us for decades we have been there to help them grow their businesses and we are now here to help them adapt to the challenges in the new environment we are accelerating our efforts to provide our partners and their customers with innovative services and products they can use during this time of disruption our investments in our digital assets have proven extremely valuable in helping them to serve their customers and drive sales this is a testament to our agile structure which is helping deliver realtime solutions and our dedicated teams who are tirelessly working to support our partners and their customers synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 and with that ill turn the call over to brian wenzel brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone allow me to briefly echo what margaret said earlier about the dual crisis facing our nation we are determined to keep our employees safe and help our partners and customers be successful during this time weve been more committed to driving meaningful change in the fight for racial equality inside our company and in the communities which we serve and live with the backdrop of unprecedented uncertainty and volatility ive never been prouder of our company and our people the values we live by and our commitment to inclusion that is the heart of who we are now turning to our financial results for the second quarter ill start on slide of the presentation first i want to cover some of the trends we are seeing from the impact of covid19 from a purchase volume standpoint and thought it was important to provide an update on performance of accounts who received forbearance slide shows yearoveryear purchase volume growth for the total company for the quarter as well as purchase volume by sales platform dating back to january purchase volume growth was strong for the total company and by platform with doubledigit growth from january through midmarch in the second half of march as government restrictions increased travel entertainment and event activity were significantly curtailed and a high number of nonessential retail stores closed there was also a significant curtailment of elective healthcare services as a result purchase volume declined significantly decreasing as much as in the first half of april for the total company in looking at the full month of april by sales platform retail card declined payment solutions declined and carecredit declined carecredit was impacted the most with a significant decrease in spending for elective and planned procedures in dental and medical services during this period retail card performed better due to the higher concentration of digital volume as well as having programs that benefited from an increase in spending for essential products such as grocery supplies and homerelated expenditures as consumers became more comfortable under stayathome orders and initial reopening phases in may and june occurred we saw a recovery in purchase volume as we moved through the second quarter in the second half of june overall purchase volume increased over the prior year and each of the three sales platforms saw a significant recovery in purchase volume from the april trough looking at some of the other key business drivers for the quarter new accounts declined and purchase volume by account declined reflecting the impact of the crisis as well as underwriting actions we took as the pandemics impact progressed through the quarter we did see a increase in the average balance per account due to a combination of portfolio mix from our digital and retail partners as well as lower than usual volume in new accounts while we are encouraged by these trends theres a tremendous amount of uncertainty which lies ahead when the stimulus measures and industrywide forbearance actions abate however our business mix including a strong digital component as well as diversification of segments being positioned to benefit from spend in areas such as homerelated expenditures as well as veterinary services will likely dampen some of the effects of the economic downturn the ultimate impact is still largely uncertain given the duration and magnitude of the pandemic is still largely unknown at this point synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 moving to slide we highlight the impact and performance of accounts that were granted forbearance compared to accounts not in forbearance through june we granted forbearance to a cumulative total of approximately million accounts or billion in account balances at the time of forbearance we have seen nearly of these accounts leave forbearance through june leaving approximately accounts or billion in account balances remaining in forbearance through midjuly these numbers have been relatively stable of the accounts that enrolled in forbearance were either current or less than days past due so relatively small number of accounts for 30plus days past due when you look at some of the performance characteristics you will see trends that are not surprising credit line utilization is higher and payment rates are lower in terms of impact on financial performance in total we have waived million in late fees and million in interest through the end of the second quarter from a trend perspective we are seeing a substantial decline in the number of accounts enrolling in forbearance from a peak in late march to early april where we saw nearly accounts enrolling per day this dropped to less than per day in june looking at payment trends for june nearly of accounts that enrolled in forbearance were making payments of those accounts paid their balance in full another were making payments leaving of the enrolled accounts not making payments from a credit perspective of the enrollees had a fico score of or below at the time of enrollment for accounts that have exited the forbearance program their credit performance is slightly worse than other similar accounts accounts off forbearance have a three times increase in the entry rate into delinquency however given the limited time the accounts have been off forbearance it is not clear at this point how those accounts will ultimately perform in delinquency it should be noted that while the performance is generally weaker than similar accounts it has not had a material impact on our 30plus delinquency measures which improved during the second quarter i will cover our delinquency performance later in the presentation we will continue to closely monitor the performance of accounts in forbearance as well as the accounts that have exited forbearance and stand ready to provide assistance to impacted cardholders moving to the second quarter financial results on slide this morning we reported second quarter earnings of million or per diluted share this included an increase in provision for credit losses as a result of the implementation of cecl this year the increase was million or million after tax which reduced eps by covid19 impacted our growth in several areas as noted on slide on a core basis which excludes the walmart and yamaha portfolios loan receivables were down and interest and fees on loan were down on a core basis purchase volume was down and average active accounts were down from last year on slide sic weve included dual and cobranded card purchase volumes and loan receivable balances to provide the level of diversification we have through these products dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the purchase volume in the second quarter and declined from the prior year on a loan receivables basis they accounted for of the portfolio and declined from the prior year as i noted earlier the impact of covid19 accelerated as we moved through march and april but we did see some encouraging signs in these metrics as we moved through may and june we would also note that while were seeing positive trends in these metrics the duration and the magnitude of the pandemic is still largely unknown and it remains difficult to provide a more precise forecast of the impact at this point synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 rsas decreased million or from last year rsas as a percentage of average receivables was for the quarter starting to reflect the impact that covid19 is having on the programs performance the provision for credit losses increased million or from last year the increase is primarily driven by the reserve increase for the projected impact of covid19related losses and the prior year reserve reduction related to walmart that totaled million the reserve build for the second quarter was million and largely due to the projected impact of covid19related losses other income increased million other expense was down million or primarily due to the cost reductions from the walmart sale the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced during the quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend these decreases were partially offset by higher operational losses expenses related to our covid19 response and charitable contributions moving to our platform results on slide as i noted earlier the sales platform were impacted by varying degrees due to covid19 in retail card core loan receivables were down with the covid19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in our digital programs other metrics were down driven by the sale of the walmart portfolio and the impact from covid19 although payment solutions was impacted by covid19 strength in powersports resulted in core loan receivables growth of interest and fees on loans decreased driven primarily by lower late fees purchase volume decreased and average active accounts decreased we signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter as noted on slide we continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added close to new merchants during the quarter these networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse which now stands at approximately of purchase volume excluding oil and gas continue to build a solid base of business for the future carecredit was impacted the most by covid19 in the second quarter but as i noted earlier we did see some encouraging sign in the trends as the quarter progressed as providers began to provide discretionary and planned services receivables declined and we did see growth in veterinary specialties that partially offset the negative impact of covid19 interest and fees on loans decreased primarily driven by lower merchant discount as a result of the decline in purchase volume which was down average active accounts decreased we continue to expand our carecredit network and the utility of our card as we added over new provider locations to our network during this quarter the network expansion has helped to drive the reuse rate to of purchase volume in the second quarter ill move to slide and cover our net interest income and margin trends net interest income decreased from last year primarily driven by an decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the walmart portfolio the impact of covid19 and lower benchmark rates on a core basis interest and fees on loan receivables decreased the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of largely driven by the impact of covid19 receivables an increase in liquidity fee and interest waivers and lower benchmark rates the loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets mix declined from to driven by the higher liquidity during the quarter this accounted for basis points of net interest margin decline the impact of fee and interest waivers from forbearance that i noted earlier accounted for basis points of the net interest margin decline a decline in loan receivables yield primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of the walmart portfolio this accounted for basis points of the reduction in our net interest margin synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 the investment securities yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for basis points of net interest margin decline these impacts were partially offset by a 58basis point decrease in total interest bearing liabilities cost to primarily due to lower benchmark rates and lower deposit pricing this provided a 48basis point benefit to our net interest margin next ill cover key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter ill start with our delinquency trends the 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and the 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year if you exclude the impact of the walmart portfolio the 30plus delinquency rate was down approximately basis points and the 90plus delinquency rate was down approximately basis points compared to last year focusing on net chargeoff trends the net chargeoff rate was compared to last year the reduction in the net chargeoff rate was primarily driven by the walmart sale and improving credit trends excluding the impact of the walmart portfolio the net chargeoff rate was approximately basis points lower than last year the allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was postcecl implementation excluding the effects of cecl the allowance under the alll method would have been the reserve build in the second quarter was million under cecl and million under the alll method the overall reserve provisioning was higher than expected due to the impact of covid19 which accounted for most of the reserve build in the second quarter in summary the second quarter trends continue to be solid forbearance providing a degree of benefit in delinquency trends we do expect the overall credit trends will be impacted by covid19 as we move forward moving to slide ill cover expenses for the quarter overall expenses were down million or from last year to slightly under billion for the quarter the decline was driven mainly by the cost reductions from walmart the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced in the quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend this was partially offset by higher expenses attributable to operational losses and certain expenditures related to our response to covid19 the efficiency ratio for the second quarter was versus last year the ratio was negatively impacted by higher expenses attributable to operational losses certain expenses related to our response to covid19 and charitable contributions excluding those impacts the efficiency ratio would have been basis points lower or approximately moving to slide given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform weve continued to build liquidity during the second quarter while we think it is prudent to have higher liquidity levels given the level of uncertainty and volatility were actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity as a result of this strategy theres a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter our deposits declined billion compared to last year we also reduced the size of our securitized and unsecured funding sources by billion and million respectively this puts deposits at of our funding compared to last year with securitized and unsecured funding each comprising of our funding sources at quarter end while we slowed overall deposit growth in the second quarter given our excess liquidity we held direct deposits at last years level of billion total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our assets this is up from last year before i provide details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in march which has two primary benefits first it delays the effects of the transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second loss for the portion of the current period provisioning under cecl to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 with this framework we ended the first quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points above last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year reflecting the preferred stock issuance last november the total capital ratio increased basis points as well to also reflecting the preferred issuance and the tier capital ratio plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing cecl and the preferred stock issuance during the quarter we paid a common stock dividend of per share last quarter we announced that given the current economic uncertainty and being as prudent as possible we made the decision to halt further share repurchases until we have greater visibility on the magnitude of the impact that covid19 will ultimately have on the economic environment we will continue to evaluate this as we move forward overall we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously we are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and operating with strong capital and liquidity levels in closing given the number of uncertainties that exist regarding the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and the countering impacts of actions such as the cares act payment assistance for consumers and other government and regulatory actions may have it remains very difficult to assess the ultimate impact at this time and provide specifics around key outlook drivers as we did last quarter i want to provide a framework to help you consider the impacts on our key outlook drivers regarding loan receivables growth covid19 had a significant impact on purchase volume particularly late in the first quarter and into the second quarter and then as businesses reopened we saw positive trends and improvement in purchase volume as long as businesses remain open we expect this trend to continue but the increase in covid19 infections were seeing nationally and the responses to this will influence whether the recovery continues and may result in further volatility as we move forward what continues to help our trends and resiliency is the growth in digital diversity inside our platforms and financing in essential areas such as home and healthcare well continue leveraging our capabilities and expertise to help our partners and providers during this difficult period this overall direction in purchase volume will be a key influence in our receivables growth rate our net interest margin has been impacted by a number of factors including the buildup of liquidity in our balance sheet and reduction in the size of our receivables the reduction in benchmark rates resulting from fed rate cuts on our receivables and investment security yields and impact of forbearance in terms of interest and fee waivers for a temporary period of time as we move forward well continue to look at means to deploy our excess liquidity and impact of forbearance should abate we do expect a benefit to net interest margin from higher interest income and fees generated from an increase in the number of accounts that will evolve in our loan receivables portfolio and continued lower interest expense finally it should be noted we also share the impact on revenues and funding costs through the rsa regarding rsas in addition to sharing the net interest income impacts we also see an impact from higher credit costs the ultimate amount of the credit cost impact and timing will be determined somewhat by the expected deterioration in credit as stimulus actions and industrywide forbearance assistance abates while we expect an increase in net chargeoff rate as the year progresses it should be noted the overall portfolio quality and credit trends as we entered this pandemic were strong and continued to improve in the second quarter also the tools and capabilities we have highlighted previously will help us better navigate the economic impacts from covid19 synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 finally we also believe higher recoveries will ultimately materialize partially mitigating the impact of higher losses while we continue to expect reserve builds to be elevated as we move forward until we gain more visibility into the duration and severity of the current pandemic and the impacts from stimulus and industrywide forbearance we cannot provide more specific guidance once we have greater visibility well be in a better position to define the expected net chargeoff and reserve build expectations going forward regarding the efficiency ratio activity levels will impact revenue and expense levels and we would look to mitigate some of the impact through expense reduction opportunities we have undertaken a comprehensive review of our operating expense base and are formulating a set of actions to rightsize our operating expense as a result of the reduction in mix in our loan receivables portfolio fundamentally the business remains strong and is resilient and were going through this situation with a strong balance sheet capital and liquidity position with that ill turn the call back over to margaret margaret m keane chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian ill provide a quick wrap up and then well open the call for qa as we have said the ultimate impact from this crisis remains difficult to quantify right now so i will reiterate that we believe we have an advantageous position to navigate this unprecedented pandemic we are wellpositioned from a credit perspective given changes we have made since the financial crisis in addition to some of the more surgical modifications weve made in recent years and that we continue to make considering the current operating environment we have a partnercentric business model and agile approach to all our operations and investments our digital capabilities and assets has helped us win important digital partners and are another vital tool to help our partners shift volume to online and mobile channels we are focused on execution today with an eye towards the future making investments building capabilities launching programs and making the fundamental changes necessary to emerge from this pandemic in a stronger position thank you for participating on the call today and i hope you and your families stay healthy and safe ill now turn the call back to greg to open the qa greg wade ketron senior vice president managing directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our comments on the quarter we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you sir well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and from kbw we have sanjay sakhrani please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning im glad you guys are doing well i guess my first question is on preprovision earnings i know theres a lot of things that brian wenzel you laid out but as we think about loan growth understanding its a little bit a moving target but the purchase volume stats are encouraging how should we think about pre provision earnings going forward was the second quarter a trough or do you think that theres more pressure ahead brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning sanjay so first if you start out with volume again we saw positive trends as we moved through the quarter from troughing in the early part of april through a plus in the end part of june id say as we moved into july were probably about a negative which kind of reflects some of the uncertainty and volatility but i would say right now its generally in the plus or minus to and we think about that trend really is a bit uncertain as we move through the quarter and how the pandemic and the effects on the economy move forward payment rate has continued to be strong but obviously as you think about that from a stimulus perspective and an industrywide forbearance perspective they may burn off here which will ultimately hopefully bring down the payment rate so as we think about receivable growth it is a little bit uncertain as we have multiple factors going different ways if you think about the margin of the business really we think this is probably a trough as receivables have moved down close to billion sequentially quartertoquarter we tried to burn off as much of that liquidity as we can well continue to try to burn that off so the impact that we saw in the quarter which was just from the higher liquidity the basis points that should begin to burn off here in the third quarter and again as we move through into the fourth quarter and internally next year the forbearance impact of basis points should for the most part be burned off here in the third quarter now so i think from a margin perspective we kind of hit that bottom and will trend up from there with regard to credit obviously weve been strong in credit delinquencies are basis points better exwalmart they havent really been impacted on forbearance and we can talk about that later but forbearance hasnt had that impact its really when we start to see those trends move through so i think from a chargeoff perspective we dont expect to see chargeoffs really rise here maybe the latter part of but more into the first half of the expenses were going to again continue to really take an active approach to manage some of the discretionary expenses as i outlined in our prepared remarks were taking a comprehensive review of expenses and really look at more structural things in order to get more cost out really to reflect the change in our platforms as a percent of mix and our portfolio mix so we would expect to come back with a series of actions that we can really undertake in the latter part of into to reduce the expenses and get that efficiency ratio back to where it would normally run so again i think theres some positives here coming out but most certainly the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 uncertainty relative to purchase volume and really payment behavior patterns are the key for us for the back half of the year sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then my followup question is on the reserve build i think i heard you brian say that its a little bit of a moving target still in terms of the credit quality migration going forward but as we think about reserve builds under a macro assumption that youve used do you feel like youre comfortable with the build that youve done and provided nothing changes on that macro assumption you dont expect future reserve builds maybe you can just talk about that macro assumption too thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure sure let me start with the macro assumption sanjay so we run multiple economic scenarios and really formulate a base case and then we have a couple of downside scenarios and what i would say is an upside scenario so to just ground ourselves when we looked at the first quarter we used a model that essentially had unemployment peaking in the second quarter around but again as i said the important parts are really where you exit and where we had unemployment really at the end of at and then in obviously if you look at assumptions today they have deteriorated from that march date so what we have done is we stepped off and we took the moodys baseline model as our starting point even though theyve issued revisions in june and july that were slightly positive that we stay with the moodys baseline and then effectively what we did is we modeled onto that unemployment we essentially redistributed unemployment to take into account forbearance to take into account stimulus so at the end of the year when you think about our unemployment exiting its in and in and we dont really get back to an unemployment rate under until so i think as you think about how we thought about the macroeconomic environment we thought about a slower recovery with potentially a greater impact on unemployment the key thing for us will be how that unemployment really develops and whether or not you see a greater what i would call higher income unemployment come into the mix later in the year as you move maybe out some lower income people so that will be a variable as you think about the reserve build then it really comes down to for us a platform mix because obviously we have platforms that attract a higher cecl reserve in carecredit and payment solutions so some of this is going to be mixrelated so under cecl we expect the reserves to be elevated on a normal basis so again i think weve taken the best guess of the macroeconomic environment as it stands today but its really going to go back into delinquency formation and loss formation as we exit sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay have a good day synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 operator from credit suisse we have moshe orenbuch please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and i was hoping maybe to start you could just talk a little bit about you mentioned margaret the partnercentric strategy and how that might impact the second half of the year youve launched the verizon card you got kind of venmo how should we think about what brian was talking about in terms of kind of volume levels currently with that partnercentric activity in the second half margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so id say theres really three parts right the retail card payment solutions and carecredit id say in each case each platform is operating fairly well weve really tried to stay highly engaged and close to our partners throughout this process so as you mentioned we were able to launch verizon which i joke around here was the first launch in a pandemic that launch went extraordinarily smooth in terms of the execution of the launch now obviously verizon is still working through how they open all their stores so what brian talked to earlier about our ability to be fully digital i think was a big win for us because weve been able to launch and have a successful launch and feel good about the program and its growth trajectory given the environment were in right now id say on venmo theres a lot of work going on obviously weve had to switch to everything being agile and virtual and that process has really been phenomenal and the teams are executing that plan and as you know in both cases were really trying to make this experience a fully digital integrated experience for the consumer which i think lessens the burden on brickandmortar as we continue to fluctuate between whats open and whats closed so we feel positive about that and ensuring that were originating the right accounts we put a lot of work into the front end of our business on fraud because that is one area that i think everyone in the business is seeing a lot of pressure on and we feel good about the tools and techniques that weve been able to put in place to really launch this program so thats really on the retail card side id say on payment solutions and carecredit a couple of things were working very closely with these partners we actually held a number of seminars held particularly in our carecredit business helping the offices reopen we shared our plans we had the folks that are working on the reopening of our offices although we havent reopened yet kind of the things that we have put in place the procedures and so what were trying to do is integrate in such a way that were helping them deal with the pressure they have to deal with as they come back online as well as ensuring that were providing them with the digital tools that theyre going to need as they shift from totally brickandmortar to more online particularly in our payment solutions platform we have a whole team there working on a new digital pos for that platform which we think will be a big win as we end the year beginning of next year so one of the things weve done is step back strategically and really look at what we were working on and really have doubled down really across the whole digital aspect of our business to ensure both digitally from a data perspective were helping those partners as they continue to reopen and deal with some of the ins and outs of closing and opening and making sure we can deliver from a digital perspective for their consumers so highly integrated lots of conversations and feeling really good about our performance so far brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 yeah moshe the other thing id add in the carecredit platform we have exciting announcement of adventhealth so when you look at the health systems component not only do we have now kaiser permanente cleveland clinic advent the ability to get into the path there and to really help our consumers as they manage their medical bills in this point in time is terrific and were building really a different type of network in that business and working closely with them in order to get that up and running with a handful of other really good health systems across the country margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial id say whats been amazing is the teams were able to execute these deals in the middle of the pandemic when many of these institutions are having a lot of challenges themselves so it goes to show the relationships that weve built pretty and our credibility in the industry so far of us being able to engage at that level during this period moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great sounds like youve become more important to them brian just a quick followup on the reserving question from before i mean the average life of your portfolio is something in the i dont know if it shrunk in this period but you used to think it was like to years can we infer anything in terms of where you might be thinking peak loss rates would be in as a result of that reserve brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah moshe i think its very difficult to kind of infer that rate because we havent seen any of the trended data really come through and its going to really dictate where we see some of the pressure build most certainly when you think about our carecredit and payment solutions those are longerdated assets with promotional financing obviously we can control the origination on the front end of that but that book will take a longer period of time i think the positive thing is that if you look at the retail card book obviously weve exited the walmart portfolio which has a higher loss content and really have gotten into what id say is some fastergrowing more stable portfolios and i think when you look at the fico mix our fico mix for the first quarter now on a sub660 basis is basis points better and only of the total so we feel good about where we are i think hopefully we use the macroeconomic assumptions that are hopefully the worst case but again well continue to monitor those as we move forward so until we see some of that trended data and the delinquency formation happen it is a little bit tough to give you that guidance for at this point moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you okay thank you very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator from jefferies we have john hecht please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys thanks for taking my questions first one is brian i think you mentioned that and tell me if im wrong that the actual purchase volume on the digital channel in q2 was up yearoveryear so a did i hear that right and second maybe within that channel can you talk about the key influencing factors i mean is most of this coming from ecommerce platforms like amazon and paypal or is it more distributed maybe just a little bit of color on that brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah sure this is brian doubles why dont i start on that the online sales penetration rate in retail card was and just to give you a little bit of historical perspective that was running in the mid20 range just a couple years ago so we feel really good about that growth the national average for ecommerce sales typically has been running in that to range so that gives you a good basis of comparison so i definitely feel like were overindexing in that channel i think it is broader certainly this year than just amazon and paypal when i think about the pandemic really this has just accelerated the digital transformation that was already underway so as margaret kind of highlighted what we did very early in the process is we went through every strategic project in the business and we said okay how can we best support our partners by helping them accelerate their digital transformation so we went projectbyproject we redeployed agile teams we worked with all of our partners big partners small partners providers in carecredit to help figure out how we could best support them so we put more resources more investment shifted things around to things like digital apply digital buy accelerating a lot of projects that were already in place so it is more broadbased than just the fact that weve been trying to engage more and win more programs in the digitalonly space were really helping our omnichannel partners transform their businesses and figure out how we can best support them in that transformation john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thats very helpful thanks and then brian wenzel i guess another followup question on the provisioning im just trying to im trying to determine if we can understand maybe your perception of the different risk factors tied to those seeking deferrals versus those who havent and with that is there a way that you could discuss the provision this quarter maybe how much of it was a specific provision for the cohort that has sought deferrals versus a general provision just tied to uncertainty and risk in the overall environment brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great john so let me start with the forbearance impact i think we tried to give you some color really with regard to the accounts that went into forbearance so the accounts entering only were delinquent at the time they went into forbearance and while they had higher credit line utilization and payment rates what weve seen is as they come off forbearance they performed a little bit worse than their kind of cohorts in the portfolio but not dramatically worse so they have roughly a three times entry rate into delinquency but when you look at the accounts that come off forbearance and look at the amount thats already in our delinquency less than basis points is in delinquency today relating to accounts that were in forbearance and if you took that whole and rolled that through its less than basis points so forbearance has not had an impact for the billion that has rolled out at this point synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 obviously well have to see how that develops were in the early stages of those accounts really performing off of the program but were encouraged by the number of people that the thats paid in full and the that are continuing to make payments so i think forbearance for us clearly has benefited our cardholders whats unknown to us is the forbearance theyre receiving in total from industrywide participants so that will be an effect so as you think about the reserve provisioning in the quarter the vast majority is the deterioration of the macroeconomic assumptions that we put into our model theres some qualitative that we put out for forbearance but its not a large part of the reserve build john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay really appreciate the details thanks guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks operator from morgan stanley we have betsy graseck please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi just a question on the rsa as were thinking about the back half of the year i think in the past you had given some expectations for how we should be thinking about the rsa in the second half versus the first half and im wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see the driver is there as we go into brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure betsy so obviously we havent provided any specific guidance mainly because some of the unknown is really related to credit but as i think about a framework how you should think about the rsa back half of this year and really into the first is the program performance so how the loan receivables really develop here and synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 more importantly how the net interest margin kind of comes back and how it develops as you begin to see delinquency developing obviously our partners share in that revenue side of the equation obviously credit costs will factor in more likely in so youll see probably an increased benefit continue in the back half of the year from a net credit writeoff perspective through the rsa as you think about the reserve provisioning which is probably the larger wild card here unfortunately what you see is first of all a platform mix issue right so so far we have booked probably more of the cecl benefit really sitting in carecredit and payment solutions given they attract a higher cecl reserve provisioning given the length and nature of those assets inside the retail card portfolio its ultimately going to come down to the mix of partners that flow in there as we know you have some partners that share in the reserve some partners that dont share in the reserve and unfortunately as we sit here today were just making estimates with regard to how the delinquency formation works and how that will go into the loss content as we build into so they are some variable pieces here so i think there is a little bit of timing where the impact of the rsa may be delayed but we really have to see where those two move from a reserve perspective but again we hope to be moving forward on a nim perspective and chargeoffs could put a little upward pressure on the rsa from just the performance before you think about reserves betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it and then margaret you did a really interesting podcast at the end of may with ice and theres a lot of detail as to how youre thinking on that and i was just wondering at one point the question was how does the pandemic impact synchrony and as a part of the answer you were talking about being a smaller company but i wonder if either there was more detail there around that that you could explain or if your view has changed given that maybe between now and the end of may things arent as tough margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i think i was really referring to the fact that we definitely have seen our assets shrink a bit and as a result of that its what brian talked about were going to have to do a reset of expenses and align ourselves so that we keep the return of the business in the area that we like i think its like any difficult situation i think people rise to the occasion and were able to really just step back and say okay coming out of this how do we want to make sure were set up for the future and i think the fact that weve been around for years have been through a lot were positioned that way but i think particularly as we move more digital were going to have to make sure our resources are aligned to align with that digital transformation that we continue to make and so i think were really looking at all the levers inside our business to ensure things dont get away from us and that were really coming out of this in a way that we have the right partners the right program the right digital experience and capabilities building out our data like weve been continuing to do and then ensuring that the returns in our business continue to deliver for our shareholders brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah and betsy the thing id add and just not to get lost in this when you think about the sequential decline in average loan receivables its down over almost billion so clearly were trying to make sure that we understand where the depth of that could be and that we react and i think when you think about the efficiency ratio in the quarter when you strip out some of the operational losses in covid19 response were at a i think efficiency ratio so we want to get that back in line with where we can continue to deliver a higher roa synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 business so thats really what i think is driving it and hopefully here well have to see how the sales play out as we move through the back half of the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you betsy have a good day operator from wells fargo we have don fandetti please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning so margaret i guess is it fair to say you continue to sort of see credit coming in better than expected it surprised me how resilient the consumer has been and i know we cant infer too much from your reserve but if ncos are peaking in the first half of it would suggest an nco loss rate that is not significantly higher than where you are and certainly a lot lower than the credit crisis do you think stimulus is whats really doing it and what are your thoughts in the nearterm margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i think look i think one thing we all know is the consumer going into this was pretty strong right so and i think what were seeing and were even seeing this in deposits right consumers have more cash theyre hoarding more cash and theyre paying their bills now i think the big caveat in all of this don is really what happens when the stimulus ends which is going to happen soon if they dont come up with a new plan what is that new stimulus and then how quickly do people get back to work and i think thats the factor where i have to say ive been around the business for years i dont think any of us wouldve expected to see what is happening happening in terms of delinquencies i think were kind of a bit surprised and thought there would definitely be more pressure there so i think we have to really see the third and fourth quarter to really understand whats the next phase of stimulus how does that play out and i do think were anticipating more job loss i think what weve seen so far is the things that are connected to travel entertainment restaurants things like that but i think every company is stepping back and looking at their own cost structures and how does that play into it so i think were trying to be cautious about this because if you just took how were doing todate we should be patting ourselves on the back and saying oh things look great but i think the reality is theres more to come and we just have to be ready for that and thats really what were trying to ensure we are doing both from an underwriting perspective ensuring were reserving properly and then the third area of really taking a hard look at expenses to make sure were positioned right as we come out of this donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial i dont know brian if youd add anything brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the only thing id add don the book is fundamentally different than it was a year ago most certainly if you work backwards in time with walmart kind of coming out when you think about the portfolio the fact today that well only have of the book below down basis points from the first quarter clearly the effects of stimulus and forbearance industrywide forbearance has driven our payment rate our payment rate was for the quarter up basis points yearoveryear so people are paying down their debt the good news is because weve migrated credit we are seeing better performance and ultimately margaret hit on the point is as unemployment does develop so when you get back to what our estimate will be towards the end of the year is there a fundamental rotation in there that will give you a different outcome were anticipating that i think we are executing our credit enhancements around that but again well have to see how that develops but i think it goes to a testament to how weve modified the book from the gfc and then really the tools and data elements that were using to manage the book today to hopefully drive credit in a fundamentally positive way as we move into this recession donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator from jpmorgan we have rick shane please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning look i want to followup on a theme that i think weve explored a little bit here but when we look at the reserve increase versus the change in economic outlook it almost feels like the correlation is a little bit lower than its been historically and again i think you guys have touched upon some of the factors there forbearance policy initiatives which have dampened that relationship im curious if you think that ultimately the risk is the duration of the cycle that could drive that correlation back to the historical norm brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks rick as you think about it i think the historical norm does have walmart and it does have some other things you have to almost adjust at the start of it the strength of the consumer and the change in the underlying portfolio as you look forward so most certainly were very sensitive to the duration of the impact or if its more prolonged than we think then most certainly it would be but when we look at our stress results even if you go back to what we published back in they are better exwalmart so i do think thats in and i think when you think about this quarter the fact that weve had such a large decrease in our receivables theres a pretty big volume offset so the rate part of the provision is up significantly in the quarter so but again its going to be you hit on it its going to be really how that curve develops out and whether or not theres a fundamental mix shift inside the unemployment were thinking synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and i appreciate that youre right theres a pretty significant idiosyncratic shift in the portfolio without walmart that has to be accounted for as well thank you guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks rick have a good day margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you greg wade ketron a senior vice president managing directorinvestor relations synchrony financial brandon we have time for one more question operator its from bank of america we have mihir bhatia please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning and thank you for taking my question wanted to quickly just followup on the reserve build discussion youve talked on this call about the potential for the unemployment pool to change a bit where you have maybe some higher income consumers lose jobs going forward and i just wanted to clarify does the reserve build already account for this change or is this something that youre keeping an eye on that youre worried that could happen and you will then need to build reserves for it i understand the magnitude might be different but just trying to understand what is already reserved for versus what wont be brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah its a great question and i think weve tried to model some of that but ultimately because were seeing a strengthening of credit as we move forward and really a strengthening of credit even inside of the credit grade its difficult to ultimately predict that so weve put some level of investment in its just subject to a lot of uncertainty now theres a lot of as we all read the indications that there are going to be a large number of layoffs in some of these higher income jobs but until we actually see that and what builds in our portfolio it is somewhat difficult but weve put some estimate in for how we think the portfolio performs as we move forward but that is just a risk factor ultimately how it develops mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc understood thanks just one other last question just could you maybe just discuss some of the newer programs youve launched and here im thinking of the synchrony home program the car care or maybe even the gp card how have they performed through the crisis and to the extent youre willing to share just in terms of the volume of credit trends and how that compares to the rest of the portfolio or even your expectations does that change your appetite for wanting to grow those just trying to understand how youre thinking about synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2020 margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial sure mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc those programs now that youve had a crisis margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah no i think id say all of them are performing well they perform no differently than the overall book i would say particularly were seeing a lot of strength in home im sure many of you have seen that homes seems to be where people are spending their money and so were definitely seeing good takeup in people buying furniture home improvement and the like so both our home card and our partners that deal in the home are definitely seeing a lot of strength car care is a little different in that the actual car card is fine but when gas has been down but thats starting to pick up as people start driving more but its still not to the level of where people were driving prepandemic but id say overall from a credit perspective and origination perspective and utilization perspective we feel really good about all of those programs and well continue to look to grow them mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc you too greg wade ketron senior vice president managing directorinvestor relations synchrony financial thanks for joining us this morning the investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and we hope you have a
