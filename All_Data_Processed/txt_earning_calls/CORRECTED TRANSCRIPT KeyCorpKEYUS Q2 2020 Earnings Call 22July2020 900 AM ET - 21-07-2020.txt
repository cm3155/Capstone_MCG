quarter earnings conference call joining me for the call are don kimble our chief financial officer and mark midkiff our chief risk officer slide is our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and nongaap financial measures it covers our presentation materials and comments as well as questionandanswer segment of our call im now moving to slide as you saw in our press release this morning we reported second quarter earnings of per share our results included a provision for loan losses which exceeded net chargeoffs by million or per share our strong results for the quarter are attributable to the resiliency and dedication of our team and their commitment to serving our clients our strong balance sheet and our disciplined risk management practices importantly for the quarter we generated positive operating leverage compared with the yearago period additionally we reported a record level of preprovision net revenue revenue was up from the prior quarter also a record reflecting doubledigit growth in both loans and deposits as well as broadbased growth of our fee based businesses driven by strength in our capital markets businesses cards and payments businesses and consumer mortgage our consumer mortgage business demonstrated continued momentum with a record second quarter performance originations of billion were up yearoveryear and consumer mortgage fee income of million more than tripled from last year our performance further demonstrated the success of our recent investments in residential mortgage our pipeline is currently at record levels and as such we expect continued strong performance in the second half of expenses for this quarter reflected higher productionrelated incentives costs related to our payments business and covid19related expenses including steps that we continue to take to ensure the health and safety of our teammates we also supported our clients by offering payment deferrals hardship support borrower assistance programs and forbearance options to help provide a bridge for individuals and businesses through these uncertain times notably we were very active in the paycheck protection program we were the seventh overall lender in the program and processed over billion in funding to support our clients funding that saved hundreds of thousands of jobs now turning to credit quality we have continued to benefit from our strong risk culture our moderate risk profile informs all of our credit decisions net chargeoffs for the third sic second quarter were basis points in our deck we have highlighted several commercial portfolios that continue to receive heightened monitoring in this keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 environment don will cover these focus areas in his comments these portfolios have generally been performing consistent with our expectations given the environment in which we are operating we also increased our loan loss reserve this quarter as our provision expenses significantly exceeded net charge offs our allowance to loan losses as a percentage of periodend loans now stands at or excluding ppp loans finally we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders in the second quarter our common equity tier ratio increased to which is within our targeted range of to earlier this month our board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the third quarter and that is consistent with our second quarter level i will close by restating that key had a strong quarter we remain confident both in our ability to achieve our financial targets and importantly the longterm outlook for our company we have positioned the company to perform through various business cycles including highly stressed periods like the one we are operating in today we will continue to support our clients and play a role to help revitalize our economy key remains well capitalized highly liquid and committed to maintaining our moderate risk profile most importantly we remain committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders now let me turn the call over to don to go through the results of the quarter don donald r kimble chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide as chris said we reported second quarter net income from continuing operations of per common share notable this quarter was our provision expense that exceeded net chargeoffs by million or per share our results also reflected strong growth in our balance sheet with doubledigit growth in both loans and deposits fees were also a standout this quarter with strong results in a number of areas including investment banking cards and payments and consumer mortgage ill cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation turning to slide total average loans were billion up from the second quarter of last year driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans reflected an increase of over billion in ppp balances or billion on an average basis consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from laurel road and as chris mentioned strong performance from residential mortgage business laurel road originated million of student consolidation loans this quarter and we generated billion of residential mortgage loans the investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly add highquality loans to our portfolio linked quarter average loan balances were up and importantly we remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile we remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longerterm perspective continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the second quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and up from the prior quarter the linked quarter increase reflects keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 broadbased commercial growth as well as growth from consumer stimulus payments and lower consumer spending this growth was offset by a decline in time deposits primarily related to lower interest rates growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients total interestbearing deposit costs came down basis points from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and the associated lag in pricing we would expect deposit costs to continue to decline approximately basis points in the third quarter we continue to have strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over of our total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the second quarter of compared to million in both the yearago and prior quarter our net interest margin was for the second quarter of compared with in the same period a year last year and for the prior quarter both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet in the second quarter of due to the impact of government stimulus programs the larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to lower yields on the paycheck protection program loans and significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows compared to the prior quarter net interest income increased million driven by higher earning asset balances partially offset by a lower net interest margin the net interest margin was impacted by lower interest rates and a change in the balance sheet including elevated levels of liquidity and as i mentioned our participation in the ppp program liquidity levels negatively impacted the margin by basis points lower interest rates caused basis points of pressure and ppp and other combined for basis points of reduced net interest margin moving to slide our feebased businesses had a very strong quarter noninterest income was million for the second quarter of compared to million for yearago period and million in the first quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest income increased million the primary driver was an increase of million in consumer mortgage business with a record level of loan originations and related fees in the second quarter of cards and payments income also increased million related to prepaid card activity from state government support programs and operating lease expense increased million driven by gains from leveraged leases service charges on deposit accounts declined million in the yearago period reflecting lower activity levels and a larger number of fee waivers compared to the first quarter of noninterest income increased by million the largest driver of the quarterly increase was an improvement in other income primarily driven by million of marketrelated valuation adjustments in the first quarter of other significant drivers of the quarteroverquarter increase included the record consumer mortgage quarter and leverage lease gains that i had already discussed as well as a million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees driven by strong commercial mortgage and debt capital markets activity im now turning to slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to billion last year and million in the prior quarter the yearago quarter included million of notable items primarily personnelrelated costs associated with our efficiency initiatives excluding these expenses were up million from the yearago period the increase is primarily related to two main drivers million of the keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 paymentsrelated expenses incurred in the current quarter as well as million of covid19related costs due to the steps that the company has taken to ensure the health and safety of our teammates compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense increased million the increase was largely due to higher incentive and stockbased compensation from strong revenue production in our investment banking and consumer mortgage businesses other drivers of the linked quarter increase include the million of payments related to costs and other covid19related expenses moving now to slide as i mentioned earlier the largest impact to our results this quarter is the build in our reserves our provision for credit losses exceeded net chargeoffs by million or per share overall credit quality trends this quarter remained very solid net chargeoffs were million or basis points of the average total loans nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter additionally delinquencies remained relatively stable with less than a increase in our to 89day past dues and the 90dayplus category declining quarteroverquarter weve also continued to monitor the level of assistance requests that we received from our customers over the past quarter the percent of loan forbearance has not changed materially as of june loans subject to forbearance terms were around based on the number of accounts for both commercial and consumer loans and about when using outstanding balances turning to slide we also updated a disclosure that we included in our first quarter 10q that highlights certain industries or customer groups that are receiving greater focus in the environment these portfolios represent a small percentage of our total loan balances importantly as chris mentioned as a group they continue to perform consistent with our expectations each relationship in these focused areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhanced monitoring the outstanding balances shown are as of june and reflect some of the draw activity that occurred late in the quarter now on to slide we continue to maintain a strong level of capital this quarter our common equity tier ratio increased from to which places us back in the targeted range of to we believe that operating within our targeted range will provide us sufficient capacity to continue support our customers and their borrowing needs and over time return capital to our shareholders as chris mentioned earlier this month our board of directors approved a third quarter common dividend of per share which was consistent with our second quarter dividend level on slide we provided our best insights for the third quarter recognizing that were still moving through some unchartered territory we expect average loans to be relatively stable reflecting a reduction in commercial line draws and more modest growth in our consumer portfolio average deposits are expected to remain relatively stable in the third quarter our outlook for net interest income would be for a lowsingledigit increase reflecting a relatively stable balance sheet and modest improvement in net interest margin noninterest income in the third quarter will likely include a step down from the record consumer mortgage fees we saw in this quarter and lower gains from operating leases overall i would expect a highsingledigit linkedquarter decline in noninterest income noninterest expenses are expected to be down lowsingle digits but are highly dependent on productionrelated incentive compensation ongoing cost to support our payments business and covidrelated expenses net chargeoffs are expected to be in the to 60basis point range this environment continues to change rapidly which can impact the outlook and comments weve provided keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 finally shown at the bottom of this slide are our longterm targets given the economic downturn we would not expect to achieve our targets this year however as we emerge from the current crisis we expect to be back on the path that would lead us to operate within these targeted ranges importantly we have not wavered from our commitment to achieve our longterm targets with that ill turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc oh thanks guys good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys so i just wanted to kind of ask about the outlook for reserving don following on your points so you took a bigger reserve this quarter some of the underlyings are understandably moving questions coming up on all bank calls now how do we know at exppp on the acl thats the comfort level where you guys want to live given the underlying trends and how do you think we outlook we look for here in terms of reserve builds thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah we believe that our allowance as of june was based on what we consider to be very reasonable kind of economic outlooks and as a general rule we would start with the moodys consensus estimate for the outlook and i would say that unlike the first quarter if you look at the outlook that we used to establish our june reserves we havent seen much of a change in that through the early parts of july you contrast that with what we saw in the first quarter where the estimates that we used as of march did decline and so we had an expectation that there would be reserve builds that we believe that the reserves are reasonable i think its also reflective of the nature and composition of our portfolio and i would say that were commercial and consumer and the consumer loans generally would have a higher reserve level to total loans and also a higher coverage ratio if you would take a look at the reserves to what this severely adverse scenarios might ph improve upon ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 got it and just second one on nii you gave the basis point impact of ppp in the nim calculation can you just help us understand what the dollars impact was and what your yield on the ppp part of the portfolio is and how youre accounting for the fees and such donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah sure that the average yield on the loans themselves are as set by the program we do take the estimated fees and amortize it over the average twoyear life thats assumed in the portfolio and so the blended yield that we would have for that loan is north of and then we would just assign a cost of funds to that loan product in order to determine what the impact is to our overall nim and this quarter about half of that basis points was related to ppp and we had some other miscellaneous items including some of the ineffectiveness of the swap portfolio and things like that that also had a drag on the nim this quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks don donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to kens question around the reserves you mentioned the macro assumptions if you could just give us a little more color on that was it purely moodys that you went with and i guess what im also interested is how keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 does it differ from the severely adverse dfast i mean your reserve right now is about half of the october midcycle the most recent one that you disclosed of your company run so im just trying to kind of triangulate the difference there between where you came out on dfast on a stress scenario versus where your reserve is sitting at now thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure and a couple of things one the dfast assumptions and the stress loss models are different than what you would have for cecl and for cecl its a life of loan which would have a different set of assumptions than what you would be using for some of the stress scenarios the stress scenarios would also assume that you could have losses on loans that are originated during that stress period and so there are some differences there that would be unique if you look at the economic assumptions that we use we start again with that consensus estimates we do make adjustments we have some qualitative adjustments we make to the allowance based on different factors including the currency of some of our loan grades and things like that and so it does result in some adjustments up but our base economic assumptions would have had for example an unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of of and would continue in the uppersingle digits throughout it would also assume that we dont get back to a gdp level that we experienced in the fourth quarter of until late in the second half of and so these assumptions are fairly conservative i would say that the other thing that does come into play for our models and also for our outlook is a significant impact that the stimulus programs have provided the cares act and other stimulus have both helped provide a bridge for some of the commercial customers with ppp program and others and also for consumers just with the additional unemployment support that the consumers have received are at a level that would not have been contemplated with the stress scenarios in the dfast results john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks thats helpful and then separately just want to get a little bit additional detail around the on the credit side i mean your npas were up a bit in the quarter and your criticized asset looks like they legged up as well im assuming that pressure is going to be in the covidsensitive areas but just wanted to get a little more clarity on where youre seeing that stress start to hit donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp no youre absolutely right more than of the increase in both those categories came in in areas related to covid i mean whether its oil and gas or some of the consumerbased commercial businesses are driving that increase for both npls and for criticized and classified christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah the only this is chris john the only thing id add on the oil and gas portfolio and i think this is an important distinction obviously oil and gas went into the cycle down even prior to covid twothirds of our exposure is really reservebased which is really assetbased type lending which is a selfcorrecting mechanism keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 what youll see is the downstream exposure that we have is services which is more cyclical than the industry as a whole by strategy is a very small piece of our portfolio which i just think is an important point john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks chris operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch im going to just piggyback on ken and johns question when im looking at slide of your presentation your allowance on your ci portfolio is which i always think about as what your expectations for the cumulative loss rate is for this cycle and your peers are close to and i guess im wondering in terms of that contrast that compares portfolio to portfolio what gives you confidence that youll significantly outperform your peers this cycle and what kind of federal reserve or government stimulus assumptions are you making in terms of direct help to corporations that dont have access to the debt capital markets donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure erika as far as the reserve levels i think that and chris highlighted this earlier which is that weve had a significant change in our underlying credit profile for the company since the last downturn and so i think thats important to note if you take a look at where were positioned as of the end of the current quarter roughly of our commercial portfolio is investment grade and thats up from just a year ago and so were seeing continued migration that would suggest that there is a strength as far as the core underlying credit relationships we have as a group the other thing that would be a little bit different for us compared to some of the peers is the level of ppp loans that are included in that ci category the last piece as far as government support were not assuming any additional government support beyond what was already passed and put through as part of the cares act and so thats not a significant contribution to future loss assumptions other than whats already been realized or benefited as far as helping to provide some of that bridge through this interim period so again i think its just more reflective of how we see that portfolio and the underlying credit quality that we see today erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and the second question is for chris so chris its clear to the investor base that you have plenty of capital to withstand this cycle and obviously if you remain profitable you wont even eat through that however the keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 fed threw us a curveball by implementing a separate income test thats separate from your capital levels and i guess the question here is if this income test on dividends is extended beyond the third quarter how are you balancing earning more than essentially prepreferred on a gaap basis versus perhaps getting your reserve to a level where investors can compare it to peers and say that youre done for the cycle christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well so just a couple of quick questions a couple of thoughts on that one obviously at the end of the second quarter our reserves are where we think they should be for the duration of the through the credit cycle on a casebycase basis so we think that were properly reserved the other thing erika to keep in mind is we have strong ppnr growth i mean the two important things to be able to pay a dividend is to manage our credit really well and have ppnr to support it and we kind of checked both of those boxes we were able to outearn our dividend in spite of taking the million reserve that we took in this quarter so we feel good about where we are its obviously a dynamic environment but we like the way were positioned erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez from ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc the nii guide does that include gains from ppp on forgiveness and just more broadly how do we think can you help us frame the potential size of that of those gains what kind of forgiveness rates are you thinking about timing i know all of this is very very fluid and subject to a fairly high margin of error but if you can i mean billion for you guys is pretty sizable and will impact nii assuming a fairly high forgiveness rate which i think seems plausible but if you can just help us understand the impact youre assuming for if any and how to think about the magnitude of both these potential gains over the next coming quarters donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure i would say that weve already started to receive just a handful of requests as far as forgiveness from some of our customers so our expectation for the third quarter does not have a significant contribution coming from that forgiveness and therefore the rapid or acceleration of the recognition of fee income we would think most of that would occur in the fourth quarter we dont have any crystal ball that would say what the exact number keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 would be but were expecting somewhere around of those loans would probably be eligible for forgiveness and the remaining would just pay down over time but thats just a placeholder for now with again the majority of that coming in the fourth quarter saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc but your guidance does it explicitly contemplate anything in the third quarter or is it donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp very very saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc or is it just a donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah very very modest most of whats saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp causing the growth for us in net interest income is the fact that were still assuming that deposit rates will come down by an additional basis points and that offsets the impact from the further libor reductions net of our hedging that weve put in place saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay i guess a related question on nii that i dont fully grasp is the average loan balances being flat your periodend loans were about billion your average was closer to billion which would imply for the average to be flat periodend has to step up from the quarter period from the endofperiod levels and so i guess can you just help me square away that math am i thinking about it right are you expecting endofperiod loans to kind of jump up from billion and if so what would drive that donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp we did have some daily fluctuations on the end of the quarter balances but i would say that for our outlook were assuming that we will have growth in the consumer categories for both the laurel road and for residential mortgage and that ppp loan balances on average will be up linked quarter and so the offset would be just further prepayments or repayments of some of the line draws and what have you on the commercial side keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so you do expect eop balances to grow in the third quarter donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp grow from the end of the second quarter thats correct saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning don i was wondering if you could talk about the nearterm outlook for cards and payments income will the prepaid card activity remain high over the next couple of quarters donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp it will remain high for the next couple of quarters many of those are for support programs that the various states have put in place and we would expect that to continue throughout this year and probably into the first part of next year as well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then maybe as a followup could you just help us understand some of the levers that key has to hitting and achieving some of those longterm targets on page here i guess specifically that to rotce quite a bit of stepup from here obviously and im wondering if thats more just macro or if there are things specific to key to helping you get to those levels donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good portion of that for right now is macro and the credit costs are much higher than what we would see on a core run rate basis in the future and so thats one of the components the other is with the absolute low level of rates that not only has a negative impact on net interest income and total revenues it also increases our equity as the oci numbers go positive and so that was another significant stepup again this quarter and at some point in time well see that bleed down as well which will provide a little bit more support for that return on tangible common equity as well i dont want you to think that were targeting that later this year or even early next year because i think just the environment is going to be challenging for us to get back up into that range but we clearly expect to see improvements from where we reported in the first couple of quarters this year terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 thanks for the insight don donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi this is janet lee on for steve i have a question on deferral on your deferrals at of total loans or about i guess billion can you share the breakdown of loan deferrals by industry exposure and how have these deferral volumes been trending since the end of second quarter donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well one as far as the deferral balances theyre fairly flat with where they were at the end of the second quarter and so we havent seen much of a change in the absolute level as far as the new request those are down about from what we were experiencing at the end of the first quarter and so its been fairly consistent as far as that overall migration were not seeing much in the way of a second round of requests yet but those are still very low and so well learn more from that going forward i would say that as far as the mix on the consumer side that its in the usual categories as far as where it might be a little bit more elevated than that than others so like residential mortgage would be a little bit higher mark do you have any insights as far as industry groups within the commercial side as far as deferrals and any takeaways from that mark w midkiff a chief risk officer keycorp the highest area would be in our commercial real estate book on the commercial side janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thats helpful ive a followup on energy book so whats the level of reserves you allocated against the energy portfolio and can you also share what percentage of the criticized loan increase in the quarter was attributable to the energy book thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah as far as the reserve levels i dont know that weve disclosed what that reserve is i would say that weve established that reserve based on the determination assessments that were put in place we feel comfortable about where we are i think chris had mentioned earlier that the majority of that portfolio is more reservebased and very little was in the oilfield services where you tend to see a little bit higher reserves overall as far as the keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 increase to the nonaccrual i would say generally about half of the increase is in oil and gas or thereabouts from what we saw last quarter christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp and just to scope the size of it its about a billion portfolio thats about of our outstandings janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right and that was referring to nonaccruals right not criticized donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp it would be a similar type of overall trend for both as far as the relative percentage of the increase janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it all right thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator operator instructions next well go to the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i was hoping you could spend just a minute talking about the investment banking pipeline and how things are trending there im just trying to get a sense for the sustainability of this level of revenues maybe even sort of balance between the debt placement side and the rest of the business donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 scott the our pipelines in our investment banking area i would label as strong and we didnt benefit as much as the largest banks from the record issuance of investmentgrade debt that was obviously a piece of our business but thats not a huge piece on the positive side our commercial mortgage business has performed really really well and in this rate environment i would anticipate that it will continue to perform well on the other side of the equation we have our backlog in ma is higher right now than it was a year ago having said that obviously for the balance of this year as people are in price discovery i dont see that backlog working its way down but in total i would characterize the pipelines as strong as you well know its market dependent r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you and then just to go back to sort of the loan growth question definitely hear what youre saying on growth on the consumer side which is helpful because i think as i look at you guys most of the larger regionals that have reported havent had the same strength in endofperiod or really even have any sense for as much stability in the loan portfolio so thats definitely good just curious what your sort of your typical commercial customer is telling you appetite to take on new debts overall tenor how theyre feeling et cetera christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so as you can imagine were out talking to our clients all the time and whats interesting it sounds kind of counterintuitive but its actually the easiest ive seen in my career to get a hold of all the decisionmakers because no ones travelling and everyone is available i would say this on the commercial side were anticipating that we had a like everyone we have a big spike up then ours actually came down earlier than a lot of people we see that as being kind of flat i dont see a lot of borrowing on the commercial side scott for the balance of the year we are fortunate in that weve always had been commercial consumer the nice thing now is we have a couple of good engines for consumer growth namely laurel road and our mortgage business that will be where most of our loan growth comes in the back half of the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah got it all right thank you guys very much donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning chris good morning don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc don can you share with us obviously you built up the reserves this quarter as you guys have indicated and if your moodys forecast comes close and your adjustments you made to if that comes close to being accurate i would assume we should not expect loan loss reserve builds anywhere close to what we saw here in the second quarter is that a fair assumption again i know its really dependent upon what the economy does nobody knows for certain whats going to happen but could this potentially if that forecast comes true potentially be the peak reservebuilding quarter donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp i would say that if to your point nobody knows where september is going to end up but i would say that if it continues to be with the same type of economic assumptions that were seeing today in july at the end of september i think that youre right that we could see this as being the peak quarter as far as the overall reserve build but going forward wed have to provide for new loan originations i would say at our current levels of loan originations thats probably an million to million kind of provision expense in a normal quarter and then you would have to just provide for any other outsized adjustments or migration as far as the underlying portfolio that wasnt contemplated but i think that the test will be just as what will the economic outlook be at the end of september and have we seen much change in that from what were seeing today gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see thank you and then second on the obviously everybodys yours included the criticized loans have grown in view of this economy were in today and the rate of growth has been dramatic for everyone do you sense that again sticking to this if the economy adheres to somewhat close to this moodys type forecast the rate of growth in criticized do you see that decelerating under that type of scenario donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well as we would take a look at our models that we used for the june allowance it would assume that you would see continued migration to criticize through the next few quarters and increases there and then also increases in the nonperforming loans just as the impact of the economy would be felt more and more throughout our commercial book especially the one thing that we really havent seen anything yet and wouldnt expect for the third quarter is any significant increases in the consumer chargeoff levels and probably wouldnt start to see that until in the fourth quarter or going into early as well but with the reserve levels that we have established the underlying assumptions would be as you would expect to see increases in npls and criticized classified for the next few quarters keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian klock from keefe bruyette woods please go ahead brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning guys thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc don quick question for you in one of your slides on the investment portfolio you talked about investing some of the excess cash and liquidity at the end of the quarter looks like it happened at the very end of the quarter so because your endofperiod balance sort of up almost billion versus the average so am i reading that right that theres that you invested that excess liquidity at a yield it does seem like theres going to be maybe a couple of basis point benefit to the nim just from that all else equal donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp i would say that no we didnt invest that yield that the additional investments really came through and t bills that we put into the portfolio at the very end of the quarter of about billionplus and the yield on that was up basis points and so brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp prospectively well probably see more of those types of temporary investments and shortterm earning assets but it did step up in the current quarter and so we only purchased about million or so of investment securities through the quarter i would say that the yield on that was in the to range and that would be our expectation prospectively as far as reinvestment yield on those purchases given the current rate environment keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so theres a modest pickup from that overall investment out of just cash or fed funds donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp youre right it was a very small pickup compared to putting it in cash to the fed so that was one of the things we did just because the liquidity levels continued to grow throughout the quarter brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks for your help appreciate it donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian foran from autonomous please go ahead brian foran q analsyt autonomous research hi youve answered most of my questions maybe just two the payments stuff i didnt appreciate the prepaid size and the key to benefits program i think you mentioned as part of the fee outlook youd expect it to remain elevated in the release it called out million im not sure if it was an absolute expense or an increase in expense but its the how does that expense for the payments work and will that also remain elevated or is that high this quarter but coming down donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp no youre right i would say that our outlook would be that the increase related to the various programs was about million in fee income and also about million in expense and for the third quarter we would expect those levels to continue at that pace it might start to show a little bit of reduction from that point forward but well provide guidance and outlook for the fourth quarter at the end of our september results brian foran q analsyt autonomous research and its like a thirdparty processing expense or why is it donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp it really is it really is a passthrough and essentially the revenues we make from that would be the earnings on the deposits that are attached to those programs but and initially thats why we didnt include it in our guidance because we thought initially it would probably be netted against the revenue as opposed to grossed up as we have to show it this quarterend and prospectively keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 brian foran q analsyt autonomous research okay and then just to make sure im understanding like the dimensions on the provision going forward if youve got a to bps nco next quarter and an million to million reserve for growth maybe youre thinking like a starting point is million and then youd encourage us to add on whatever we all think on top of that based on economic outlook and everything and then in or maybe we should think about maybe similar levels of reservebuilding for growth but a little bit of chargeoff stepup as just a natural delay from forbearance programs and stuff is that kind of a fair footing and starting point based on everything youre putting out there donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well actually the chargeoffs that we would have are embedded in the reserves that weve already established and so that million to million would essentially be the new provision expense and the increase to the overall reserve from that component so as long as our chargeoff performance is consistent with our current assumptions included in our reserve balance we wouldnt have to establish provision expense to cover those chargeoffs prospectively so what our provision will cover is one new loan growth which the impact there would be million to million two would be any changes in the economic outlook and as weve said before were not seeing a significant change in that economic outlook today versus what we saw as of june when we established the reserves and three would be any different migration in our portfolio compared to what our models would assume and so each of those are factors that would be used in establishing the allowance for next quarter but as long as the economic assumptions dont change and as long as the migrations consistent with our expectations the only thing youre left with there is provision for loan growth and so it would be in that million to million range as opposed to the million that youve talked about brian foran q analsyt autonomous research im glad i asked that was only off by a factor of there donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you for clarifying that brian foran q analsyt autonomous research thank you thank you for that operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi yeah one more question on the reserve and my question is is the reserve high enough now of course nobody knows that answer you certainly reserve provision more than the losses but two questions one since quarterend covid cases have increased which could mean some shutting down of locations now youre not keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 as exposed to some of the mostexposed covid regions but just your thoughts since quarterend because don you said it would be the same today but there are some mixed currents there and then a more broader question for chris the largest corporations are able to tap the capital markets and youre an expert on that and love to hear your thoughts about that and the smallest firms have the ppp program but those companies in the middle the companies that historically has been keycorps sweet spot where they might not have access to capital markets not small enough to the ppp programs really those companies that are dependent on the main street lending program which seems like its off to kind of a slow start so how do you think about your sweet spot your exposure to those smaller middlemarket companies as this kind of shutdown or slower growth continues thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure mike so thanks for the question ill take that one last and then first and then well talk a little bit about kind of reserves and what our mix is of our business because i think its important as you look at the large companies obviously they have access to capital they demonstrated that they had access to capital when the markets opened up in march they went to the markets in a significant way and many of those draws have now been paid down i think our utilization rate actually dropped about so then on the other end of the spectrum as you correctly point out the really small companies its almost impossible to distinguish between the company and the individual and thats because year after year they basically take out the equity and that can be a good thing or a bad thing given the financial strength of the individual in the middle which we have a lot of clients the good news is the clients are performing well a lot of those clients were in fact eligible for ppp the main street program i will tell you will be unlike the payroll protection program that was a real systematic approach for us here at key main street will be more idiosyncratic oneoff kind of ph helping of our clients but in total that midsize group of companies is performing very well so i think they seem to be in good shape at the moment now obviously everyones been impacted by covid19 i mean there isnt a single customer or a single individual or a single business but what were seeing is and as i said were out there talking to them a lot as it relates to the reserve the premise of your question is absolutely right nobody knows one of the things though that i think sometimes is missed and you know this because youve been following us for a long time is our mix is a lot different than others were commercial consumer and if you look for example at our dfast results that we just received that would show a loss content under dfast of say on ci and for example on credit card as you know we are a very small player in credit card so thats just the only point i would make is the importance of mix don donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp mike youre right i mean we dont know what the impact would be as far as any further shutdowns on the economic outlook and we hadnt factored that in as part of our june reserve and well have to see how that plays out between now and september and i would say again that our assumptions still show stress in the environment with a unemployment level in the fourth quarter and continuing the levels of highsingle digit kind of unemployment through and not really seeing a full recovery of the economy back to the fourth of level until late in and so could it get worse from here it could we dont know but what weve established our reserves are are based on what we feel is a reasonable outlook as of june keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just one followup you mentioned i mean capital markets are good but still behind the biggest players and is that just mix of clients by size or is it mix of fixed income versus other areas how would you explain that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp its investmentgrade fixed income that is a relatively smaller part of our business given that we play in the middle market and as a result we didnt perform to the level that some of the largest banks performed either in the issuance of investmentgrade or frankly the trading was obviously a big plus for some of the large institutions mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right so you say thats mix not execution in your mind christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thats right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc just any update you can provide on laurel road obviously the production is very good i think youre keeping most of it on balance sheet right now just given what markets are doing but the customer base is highearning dentists and doctors and obviously theres been some dislocation there earlier in the year but i think most of them are up and running now so just an update on that portfolio overall from a volume perspective and credit quality would be helpful thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure youd be very pleased with both the volume and the credit quality that were seeing from laurel road and to your point a high percentage of it is healthcare doctor dentist related and so some of those practices were negatively impacted at first but many of them are back up and open and we continue to see the payment trajectory and just the overall performance be consistent if not better than what we would have initially expected so very pleased with that credit quality and the performance overall matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and do you plan to portfolio still all the production i think at one point you were contemplating securitizing some of it but obviously those markets have gotten not all of them are open right now donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp the markets are tighter but more importantly our liquidity levels and capital levels are such that allows us to retain that on balance sheet but we did about million of securitization last year i could see us doing something similar to that maybe later this year and just to keep the name out there and keep the familiarity with investors in the product so i would say that generally we would expect to do some but probably at a very modest level matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you
