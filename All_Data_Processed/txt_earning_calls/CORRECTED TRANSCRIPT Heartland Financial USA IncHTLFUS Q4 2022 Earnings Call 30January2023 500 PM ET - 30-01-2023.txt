now turn the call over to bryan mckeag chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon as bruce just outlined this was another strong quarter for htlf with earnings per share of loan growth of just over million revenue growth this quarter of over million and stable clean credit performance included in this quarters results were three large notable items first million of losses on the sale or write down of assets ph which were primarily facilities related second charter consolidation restructure costs million and third shareholder dispute resolution costs of over million together these items decreased pretax net income by more than million and earnings per share by before i go into more detail i want to remind everyone that our fourth quarter earnings release and investor presentations are both available in the ir section of htlfs website so ill start my comments with the provision for credit losses which totaled million thats a million decrease over last quarter this quarter the provision reflects our strong loan growth continued stable healthy credit performance and an economic outlook that anticipates a moderate recession developing over the next months in addition the provision benefited from million of net loan loss recoveries at quarterend the allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments increased million to million or of total loans in addition at quarterend unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled just over million or basis points of loans moving to investments investments remained flat at billion representing of assets with a taxequivalent yield of and will generate cash flows exceeding billion over the next months we continued to actively manage the portfolio by taking several actions during the quarter first we utilized nearly million of cash flow this quarter to fund loan growth and second we took advantage of some midquarter market disruption and reinvested million of cash flow into a aaarated security with a purchase yield of nearly and a duration of less than a year with regards to capital regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier at just over and total riskbased just over the tangible common equity ratio reversed a severalquarter decline increasing basis points to at quarterend the rise in market value of investments this quarter contributed basis points of the increase moving to the income statement starting with revenue net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million higher than the prior quarter and the net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis rose basis points this quarter to the main drivers of the increase were our strong loan growth and asset sensitive balance sheet and the feds shortterm interest rate increases this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which is unchanged from the prior quarter noninterest income of million this quarter was higher than the prior quarter excluding security losses core noninterest income was million which was at the highend of heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 our million to million forecast so in total quarterly revenue grew million or and exceeded expectations shifting to expenses noninterest expense totaled million this quarter thats up million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses the run rate of recurring operating expenses increased million to million compared to million last quarter and exceeded our forecast of million to million operating expenses were higher than anticipated in q4 primarily due to legal and other cost reimbursements related to the resolution of a shareholder group dispute and higher incentive compensation accruals due to strongerthanexpected quarterly revenue and loan growth as a result of the strong revenue growth this quarter the fourth quarter efficiency ratio improved to from last quarter now looking ahead to htlf expects to see continued success and improvement highlighted by expected loan growth of to next year with million to million expected next quarter deposit growth is expected to be to next year with q1 expected to show nominal growth investment cash flow will be utilized to fund the gap between loan growth and deposit growth net interest income for q1 will be down versus q4 due to two fewer days in the quarter full year net interest income will be much higher than that reflects our higher net interest margin and larger balance sheet however the magnitude of the increase will be dependent upon future fed rate moves and deposit pricing which are difficult to predict at this time provision for credit losses are projected to range from million to million per quarter given projected loan growth and assuming credit trends begin to normalize from their current levels however declines in economic conditions and projections could significantly impact future provisions if a worsethanmoderate recession develops core noninterest income that is excluding investment gains and losses is expected to be million to million next quarter and is projected to raise to on a full year basis as persistently weaker mortgage revenue is offset by growth in other income categories primarily commercial fees recurring operating expenses are expected to be million to million next quarter and show a to increase on a fullyear basis this includes the impact of an increase in fdic cost of million to million for the full year charter consolidation restructuring costs are expected to be million to million next quarter in total we estimate the remaining cost to complete the project will approach million over the next four quarters and finally we believe a tax rate of to excluding new tax credits is a reasonable run rate so with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions and answers bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you bryan we want to open up the call tawanda heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now conduct our qa session operator instructions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc hi terry bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi bryan thanks for all the financial outlook maybe if i could just ask a question the million of benefits from the charter consolidation could you remind me is that all on the expense side and then maybe if we just take a step back could you give us a few realworld examples of the benefits of the charter consolidation outside of the numbers and maybe just to finish the thought there has there been any impact on local decision making or even the perception that things have changed there thank you bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan let me maybe answer or give some comments on terrys last question there is absolutely no impact on local decision making not only the perception but theres actually no impact the decisions that our local ceos and leadership teams were able to make precharter consolidation and postcharter consolidation are exactly the same so theres absolutely no change there and its actually gone very very very smoothly bryan why dont you talk a little bit about the realworld examples of not just the expense side but the actual changes because your area has a lot of that benefit bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think theres certainly internal efficiencies that well gain terry for example not doing as many call reports thats a simple one right but we also manage multiple investment portfolios well eventually only need to manage one same with liquidity maintaining liquidity at banks versus so theres a lot in finance theres heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 throughout the operations side ph rego doesnt have to be reported as much theres some compliance things that help as well so theres lots of those things i think additionally for customers it will be easier for them to bank at any one of our locations across the footprint easier than it is today and so there are customer benefits as well in terms of the million efficiency gain in terms of dollars its really in a couple maybe two or three places the predominant places is expense savings as you can probably see our fte count is down already whether we have to replace some of that but we certainly wont have to replace it i dont think all back to the levels that we were before because it will become more efficient so theres some cost takeouts for not having to do certain things but theres going to be efficiency gains as well where we wont have to add back people even if we continue to grow and maybe the third and this is probably the smaller one is theres probably some efficiencies in the treasury area just with when we do exercise some of our trades theyre probably bigger blocks and we can maybe get a little bit better execution so oh one other thing indiscernible one big benefit that we get internally is we dont have to participate loans back and forth between banks and we spend a lot of time in the operations area and in the finance area kind of sorting that out and we put it all together but then keeping the bank separate so bruce anything else to add bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah just two other things and i want to piggyback on what bryan just said about the internal loan participations between our charters one of the real benefits of the banks that weve already consolidated is that their balance sheet and therefore their income statement now actually reflects the work that theyve done where before if they had made a loan and it was participated only the amount of the loan that was not participated remained on their balance sheet so theyre actually now getting the full benefit for everything theyre doing whether its originating loans or on the deposit side theyre getting the benefit of the deposits if others are using those deposits to fund loans so that and then also we had to manage capital at different charters in the past where now you dont have to do that so those are just some of the kind of the nonexpense side but the real benefits in how we operate going forward terry thanks for the question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yeah thanks for all the color there and then as a followup on the deposit side whats that million of brokered cds at can you just talk about how long you expect those to be on the balance sheet is it kind of a oneyear type product and maybe whats our deposit beta good going forward from here its been relatively low so far bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan why dont you take that one bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah so i think the million of brokered cds i believe are all less than a year and i think theyre predominantly less than six months so theyre not long cds terry and then our deposit betas and you probably heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 can see in the deck that theres been about or basis points or beta in the fourth quarter i think those will move up a little bit it wouldnt surprise me if we saw another to ticks on that beta it just were having to do a little bit of catchup but weve moved pretty close to the mark but were going to move a little bit more to stay with the market and on our commercial side we have been making decisions all along that we need to make to make sure that we maintain our customers and are open to what relationships we have to customers to price appropriately terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you for taking my questions and enjoy the night bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of damon delmonte with kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good evening guys hope you guys are all doing well today and thanks for taking my questions just wanted to ask a little bit about the margin bryan i heard the commentary that nii will be down on a lower day count in part just kind of wondering where you see the margin peaking if you think its a first quarter event or a second quarter event and kind of how you look at the cadence of the margin throughout the year bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah now thats probably the toughest question im going to get today just because indiscernible bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc but let me take it in chunks i would say the first quarter here our margin i would say without any fed moves would probably stay just slightly below the that we posted i think as i said theres some latent beta catchup here that i think happened in december and maybe even early january so i think well fight without any fed help to stay there now if the fed raises like everybody thinks basis points in a couple of days well get a little bit of benefit from that but not nearly like we were getting before and i think the deposit betas are going to continue to ratchet up a bit so we might get a tick or two there so i would say allin were going to stay somewhere in the first quarter between for sure and maybe on the top end for the full year if the fed doesnt reduce rates in the last half of the year maybe we get one additional so we get two bumps instead of one i think we can stay above but we probably are close to topping out now we might go up a little bit with the fed move but i think were going to slide back down so we might touch a little bit higher but i think were going to bounce around this to maybe once in a while but then i think long term were in the heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful no thats helpful thank you and then with regards to the outlook for loan growth i think you said like to are you seeing greater opportunities on the ci side or the cre side or is it kind of equally weighted bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah this is bruce let me take that and then ill ask nathan to weigh in since he sees everything i think theres more opportunity right now on the ci side and our agribusiness group is also generating a lot of opportunity theres some activity clearly on the real estate side particularly in the industrial space some of the warehousing some distribution and a couple of the markets still has some multifamily activity going on nathan do you want to add to that nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah bruce i would fully concur i think the opportunities really do show themselves on the ci side and then where were seeing opportunity on cre and being very strategic we do see some good opportunities there as theyre coming about but theyre just not as prevalent as they had been historically ph currently were just watching it a little bit tighter now and taking precautions appropriate for sizing and doing sensitivity to make sure that theyll perform through the cycle damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and kind of a more technical or a detailed question here what is your exposure to office space bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah we have just a little bit north of million exposure there from a balance perspective damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect okay great thats all that i had thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks damon bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 hey damon indiscernible just to add maybe on to that office though nathan you might add where those offices are typically located because i think office can be a very general term is it downtown highrise office space is it more lowrise suburban could you give a little bit of that color nathan because i think that would help everybody on the call nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah absolutely yeah just by nature of kind of where were located in our footprint we really stay kind of more focused outside of the central business districts and more focused kind of in a suburban office kind of really looking at more of a granular portfolio multitenant nature amortizing and we think very well underwritten so so far we feel very good about where were at but we are watching in very diligently and kind of continuing to stay in front of it talking with our customers and making sure that we understand kind of where theyre at and so we can make those decisions earlier but from that perspective we do feel that the performance today still looks pretty good bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks for doing that nathan operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon maybe one for nathan just wanted to the type of loans that were i guess resolved out of nonaccrual in the quarter i think around million net but just wanted to kind of get a sense for what was recovered nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah absolutely we its really there wasnt any area of significance the recovery was really on a credit that we had in agriculture from really several years back just due to the really great work done by our special assets group to stay with it was really able to see through and get some recoveries there but from the nonperforming perspective kind of how thats been going we just continue to work it down i wouldnt say theres any one area specifically we could call out as being systemic as were working through it its just the overall book itself we continue to work hard to make sure were getting out of those credits and getting them either a back into our performing line of business or helping them find a different bank or opportunities for them going forward jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and nathan thats not any bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co change sorry bruce go ahead bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc no i was just going to provide a little more color jeff the recovery was on a loan that had been previously fully charged off so it didnt have any that was not connected to the decrease in our nonaccrual loans jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co right yeah i kind of flubbed the question there i was really looking for the direction of nonaccrual i got you but i think nathan indiscernible overly specific its been just continued work and kind of the follow on was theres no change in aggressiveness its not as if this mild recession is upon us you didnt change gears andor anything its just working those credits and just got like you said nondescript reductions in nonaccruals nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc correct jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc indiscernible jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and just a follow on maybe for bryan did that recovery impact the margin at all was there anything in there that youd say that kind of noncore or just the bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah no there was no interest recovery it was all principal recovery this one jeff just for a little bit of color this one was one of the loans that we charged off coming into the covid we had a couple of big chargeoffs and as we entered covid i think it was back from that time so its been like almost years since we took the chargeoff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it great thanks and just jumping over on topics to the expense side i wanted to make sure i got the million to million and bryan you said to full year growth correct heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yes jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and that would exclude the chartered restructuring costs of million correct bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc correct yeah it excludes those items i always exclude the charter restructuring any tax credit costs from last year any gains and losses that are in that expense line item jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc if we back those out of last year and put a or increase on top of that thats where i think jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co bryan do you do you have a core expense number relative to the ph like what would be the core bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc i probably could get it i dont have it here and ill need to do some math im sometimes doing math while everybodys on the call jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co i understand yeah if we could follow up indiscernible bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc it is pretty easy though jeff if you go to our income statement theres three line items specific to those three items i talked about jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay indiscernible heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co i appreciate it i could probably track it down okay well thank you ill step back bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks jeff operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch with piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co following up on the expenses here just looking in once the charter conversion is complete charter consolidation is complete you have the cost savings in there has there been any have you looked out and seen what other investments in the franchise you expect to make are any of these savings going to be redeployed or do you think theyre all going to follow the bottom line bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah andrew i think thats a really great question and i would anticipate that as im thinking about it over half of them will probably redeploy into the charter with products or potentially some geographic expansion but its really where the opportunities are and andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it no thats helpful bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc at the end of the day yeah and one of the things that weve been talking about as you know well probably reinvest in our consumer deposit platform thats one of the things that well probably reinvest in during heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc maybe the back half of or early in andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay got it thats helpful there and then on both the growth for this year to deposit growth i guess where is that deposit growth coming from i would imagine its not on the wholesale side like you had here this last quarter but whats giving you the confidence that to is achievable in this tougher environment bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah we think itll come from the commercial side and the small business side where weve been generating a lot of new business and new opportunities we think the consumer side honestly will probably be flattish as were just now starting to see the average balances in our consumer accounts start to decrease youve heard us talk in the past that those extra balances during the pandemic they were holding steady we just saw them start to decrease for the first time during the fourth quarter so our goal is to generate enough new business to offset that decrease on the consumer side and we think that well be able to grow the commercial and the business banking and small business side on a goforward basis and we would have done that this year except we did have a significant commercial operational outflows in the quarter that i referenced andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it all right thanks for taking the questions ill step back bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks andrew operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc hi everyone bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc hi david heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc hello i wanted to circle back to the discussion on the deposit base and bryan you gave some good color so appreciate it but just as youre looking out to the rest of this year noninterestbearing i think were at about where do you think that ends the year and do you have a rough deposit beta all in that youre using for your outlook for this year as well bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc bryan do you want to take that one bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think our ddas are the way we calculate them i dont know if maybe youve got average balances or something dave but i think its but thats down a little bit from where it was so that has moved a little bit this year with the way deposits have flowed so we think that that can probably solidify and some of that outflow that we saw at the end of the quarter was out of dda in the commercial side so hopefully some of that will flow a little bit and build back and i think the new customers that bruce is talking about if were successful in bringing in ci customers which we have been those tend to be more dda and noninterestbearing accounts so i think there we can hold our own and maybe grow just a little bit on the dda side and certainly grow the nonmaturity deposits in total betas that we bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and we think dave bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc go ahead yeah go ahead bruce bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc no go ahead bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc ill finish with the betas and then you can jump in and add some color i was just going to say our betas that we model are typically around to on the nonmaturity and probably around on the cds kind of blends together for something in the mid for overall betas now weve been doing better than that particularly we did better than that in the first probably 250basispoint move where we didnt move much if any so i still think we have some catchup which is why i think our margin is not going to go a lot higher and its going to kind of tread water here because were probably going to be having some catchup on those betas if youre going forward heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2023 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah david i was just going to mention on that commercial deposit growth that will also help us on the treasury management fee side because those operating accounts of all those new relationships were able to provide them with our products that we have on the treasury management side as well as those ci customers are using more of our capital markets products whether theyre swapping their floating rate loans which this quarter of our loans were floating which is an alltime high for us david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for the additional color and then just the last thing i want to ask is back to the deposit side within your footprint very broadbased footprint do you notice any material differences in deposit pricing within your footprint are you getting better pricing out west maybe in the midwest maybe texas i guess the question specifically would be where do you see the least amount of deposit competition and where do you see the most competition bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i think the midwest always has had more competition than the west i mean thats been the history and youve heard us talk about that in the past but i would tell you the one market that probably we do the best in is in new mexico that would and its not so much that theres no competition its just weve got a great team out there theyve been there a long time and there arent as many credit unions as an example out there where we are seeing the highest competition is where there is significant credit union activity which also tends to be in the midwest david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for taking my questions guys appreciate it bryan r
