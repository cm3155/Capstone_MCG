our portfolio is somewhat equally weighted between the three major loan types this differentiates east west from many other regional banks we also benefit from a geographic footprint with locations in dynamic metropolitan areas we believe that this diversification is a strength that provides multiple engines of growth and reduces credit concentration risk we are positive about a trajectory of loan growth across our business lines our retail branch network is an excellent source of new consumer and commercial banking relationships we continue to see high origination volumes for single family mortgages and home equity lines of credit which we primarily originate through our branches furthermore through our retail branches we are also growing small business ci loans and smaller size

we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolios during the second quarter we originate billion of residential mortgage loans an increase of sequentially this was a record quarter of residential mortgage origination for east west and although we expect this to slow as the market changes good momentum is continuing into the second half of the year residential mortgage loans were billion as of june growing by annualized from march i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start with asset quality metrics on slide overall were very pleased that all of our key asset quality metrics improved quarteroverquarter total criticized loans were down by to billion as of june or of total loans we saw improvement across all significant loan portfolios nonperforming assets were down by to million or basis points of total assets as of june the broadbased improvement in asset quality included our oil and gas portfolio a better operating environment for the sector drove several upgrades this along with workouts payoffs and paydowns reduced oil and gas criticized loans to and nonaccrual loans to of the portfolio accordingly we released million of loan loss reserves allowance coverage of oil and gas loans was as of june compared with as of march on slide we present the component of our allowance for loan losses our allowance totaled million as of june or of loans excluding ppp compared with million or as of march and compared with on day one post cecl net chargeoffs decreased to million in the second quarter from million in the first quarter the second quarter net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized an improvement of basis point from basis points annualized in the first quarter during the second quarter we recorded a negative million provision for credit losses compared with zero provision in the first quarter currently we do not expect to report a provision for credit losses in the second half of the year and now moving on to a discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides id like to flag a couple of noncash items and noninterest income other investment income increased by million sequentially reflecting higher valuations of cra sbic investments during the quarter included in interest rate contracts and other east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 derivatives are marktomarket adjustments which were a million loss in the second quarter compared with a million gain in the first quarter these primarily relate to changes in the credit valuation adjustment the second quarter income tax expense was million and the effective tax rate was the yeartodate effective tax rate for the first half of was and we expect that the full year effective tax rate will also be ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with the average balance sheet second quarter average loans of billion grew by million or linked quarter annualized and by linkedquarter excuse me annualized excluding ppp as dominic discussed growth was broadbased across our major loan portfolios and strongest from residential mortgage second quarter average deposits of billion were up by billion or linkedquarter annualized aside from time deposits all other deposit categories increased led by noninterestbearing demand deposits at a rate of annualized as a result our average loantodeposit ratio was in the second quarter down from in the first quarter our average earning asset growth in the second quarter reflected the strong deposit growth yeartodate on average basis securities available for sale increased by billion and repo assets increased by million this was partially offset by a billion decline in average interestbearing cash and cash equivalents as we deployed some of our excess liquidity overall the mix of average earning assets was higher yielding in the second quarter during the second quarter million of fhlb funding which carried an effective interest rate of matured and was paid off turning to slide second quarter net interest income of million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing by linkedquarter annualized quarteroverquarter the net interest margin expanded to in the second quarter an increase of basis points from the prior quarter income related to ppp loans was million in the second quarter and included million of deferred loan fees similar to the amount in the first quarter as of june we had million of ppp deferred loan fees remaining to accrete into income as you can see in the waterfall chart on this slide the basis point quarteroverquarter increase in the net interest margin breaks down as follows plus basis points each from a lower cost of interestbearing deposits and from the deployment of excess liquidity partially offset by minus basis point each from lower other earning asset yields and lower loan yields the lower cost of deposits more than offset the drag to net interest margin from lower yields and the deployment of excess liquidity expanded the net interest margin in the quarter in our updated outlook we expect the full year net interest income excluding ppp will grow by to year overyear which is just ahead of our anticipated loan growth of to this reflects the impact of securities available for sale and repo asset purchases in addition to net interest income expansion driven by loan growth turning to slide the second quarter average loan yield was and excluding the impact of ppp the adjusted loan yield was down slightly by basis points from in the first quarter turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the second quarter dropped to basis points an improvement of basis points from the first quarter the spot rate of total deposits as of june was basis points down by basis points from march east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 our cost of deposits declined as maturing higher rate cds repriced to current market rates and we decreased rates paid on money market and interestbearing checking accounts we expect to further reduce our cost of deposits as the maturing cds reprice over the second half of although the impact of this will diminish after that the average cost of cds in the second quarter was basis points a drop of basis points from the first quarter in the second quarter we originated a renewed billion of domestic cds at a blended rate of basis points and a weighted average duration of four months we have million of cds maturing in the third quarter at a blended rate of basis points and another billion in the fourth quarter at a blended rate of basis points moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the second quarter was million and this reflects the noncash items noted on slide second quarter fee income and net gains on sales of loans were million up by million or from the first quarter higher transaction volume and new customer acquisition growth helped the increases in customerdriven foreign exchange income lending fees wealth management and deposit account fees fee income growth momentum is continuing into the third quarter and we expect these business lines to show strength for the full year quarteroverquarter interest rate contracts revenue decline reflecting lower customer transaction volumes and demand in the current interest rate environment moving on to slide second quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the second quarter a decrease of million or sequentially this reflects careful expense management and a quarteroverquarter decrease in compensation and employee benefits from a seasonally high first quarter yearoveryear adjusted noninterest expense increased by the second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the first quarter importantly we achieved our efficiency ratio not just through expense management but through increased revenue reinforcing our revenue growth is our continuous investments of people and technology to expand our banking capabilities and product offerings and with that ill now review our updated full year outlook for on slide weve updated our full year outlook for relative to a quarter ago for the full year of compared with our full year results we expect yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp in the range of to up from our prior outlook of approximately yearoveryear adjusted net interest income growth excluding ppp in the range of to weve adjusted our outlook to incorporate the impact of yeartodate securities and repo purchases which we expect will lift net interest income growth ahead of loan growth adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization of yearoveryear unchanged from our prior outlook based on our macroeconomic forecast and loan growth outlook at this point we do not expect to book a provision for credit losses in the second half of the year full year effective tax rate of approximately including the impact of tax credit investments unchanged from our prior outlook with that ill now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 thank you irene in closing we had a very strong second quarter and expect that to continue for the rest of the year while the hard work and excellent execution by all of our associates drive our results and is a true testament of the culture of east west i would now open up the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just first question maybe for irene for you around cash management youve been buying into the afs portfolio as well as the repos just give us a sense of how youre thinking about holding on to excess liquidity what is the duration of these assets that youre adding and just overall asset sensitivity of the bank as we think about eventually short rates going higher irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yes great question ebrahim certainly i think our view from what we the actions that we took in the first quarter have shifted a little bit with the longterm rates coming down so although we do expect to redeploy some of our excess cash were a little bit shy as far as going out too long and i think well be a little bit more cautious than the actions that you saw we took in the first quarter when the tenure was higher and we redeployed about billion into a longer duration securities and repos the repos are variable rate i think thats more attractive for us in the current environment and the securities that were buying right now probably about largely mbs cmos about ph kind of rates ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess separate question dominic for you loan growth seems to be very strong deposit growths are very strong give us a sense now that you had like six to nine months under the biden administration the headlines around uschina still suggest a lot of tension how is that impacting your growth outlook how youre going about growing the bank because thats something that consistently keeps coming up from an investor standpoint when they say think about east west east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good question well first of all i think in the second quarter we are growing nicely in china and our crossborder business and i think that has a lot to do with well the political mavericks out there is always going to be there because that seems to be something that gain a lot of traction among politicians and so forth but if you look at the business there are still obviously a lot of business going on between us and china and now the headline news about some of the large investment may not be coming but you have to understand from east west bank perspective we are mainly focusing on the middle midsized business and they are not the highprofile business and then they are not a highlysensitive kind of business like artificial intelligence or very much hightech stuff so from our perspective plenty of our clients continue to do crossborder business and they are doing fine and now we also have to reflect back on for the last four years under the trump administration there are a lot of the not only just rhetorics but also actual enforcement of tariffs our clients navigated through it wasnt easy and east west bank navigated through and in fact every single year we had growth for the last four years and in terms of overall risk management were doing great reason being is that this is our strength we have the expertise in the crossborder uschina space and this is something that we are really good at if i look at just the last two quarters we have very diversified growth in our china operation and we have very diversified growth in us from a crossborder business and spread from clean energy general manufacturing wholesale consumer goods to private equity et cetera so we have a pretty broad base of growth opportunity i think one of the things i really want to highlight is that the reason of the growth is not that unlike the multinational companies or the money center banks who actually for the last six months or so has been stepping up and investing in china you heard the news about jpmorgan morgan stanley goldman sachs they are all stepping up and investing more in china the standard chartered hsbc they are talking about hiring thousands of people in hong kong were not doing any of that weve been very very consistent to focusing on our strategy of being the bridge between east and west and selling crossborder business but what we have done is over the last few years we talked about it in the quarterly earnings release often that is that we continue to make investment in technology in cash management product capability assets capability et cetera the whole idea is that we build a platform we build product capability that fit the customer needs during the crossborder business whether theyre us companies exporting to china importing from china or maybe having investment in china or vice versa were providing the product capabilities to support them four five years ago it was half aspiration half capability today we have a lot more capability from a technical standpoint so when you see the growth of fee income and treasury management when you see the fee income of foreign exchange ph that we have this record fee income in this quarter and a deposit a nice deposit growth dda and so forth and together with loans is no surprise because we have built up the capability to allow us to expand not only with new customer relationships but also getting a larger wallet share for many of our existing customers who maybe four years ago werent able to do certain type of like foreign exchange or maybe certain type of cash management relationship with us because the little bit lack of capability in the past that we were able to correct that so our digital offering and our online offering are much stronger and well continue to build that and in the next few years well continue to focus on building that capability because the market opportunities is enormous for east west bank that have the strong expertise to continue to expand in this direction east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 operator the next question will come from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you good morning i guess when you think about loan growth on a go forward basis obviously resi mortgage has just been such an amazing driver of that growth but when we think when you look out to the second half of the year maybe into does resi continue to be the main driver or do you think the ci could actually start picking up a fair bit from here dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc ive been predicting the demise of singlefamily mortgages for the last four five years and i was wrong every single year so somehow every two quarter i start talking internally with our team and saying that im not sure that singlefamily mortgages origination can sustain in this level and so my mortgage department continue to pleasantly surprise me because i thought fourth quarter last year was that alltime high theres no way that we can ever beat that and then first quarter just beat that and then then i thought it will be over and then second quarter come in and then become record performance again now at some point being prudent indiscernible expect that at some point ph it will suffice but then i would say that looking at the pipeline today and looking at the origination that still seems to be going when we will slow down i dont know yet but in the meantime we are very confident with our ci growth and our cre growth our approach has always been were going to try to do it in a very balanced approach this whole pie chart that we share that we have of somewhat equally distributed type of balance sheet in terms of somewhat equal weight of ci cre and singlefamily and so if one particular area is slowing a little bit hopefully the other two will pick up and so far thats been working just like that and i would expect that maybe when economy start picking up even more and east west continue to so far weve been able to for the last months weve been continuing getting new ci customers and it just as a matter of math because we get so many new ci customers at some point the balance will grow and so i expect that that ci will continue to grow and hopefully at a time that singlefamily start slowing down a little bit the ci will step up a little bit more so thats what we see at this point but so far things look pretty good ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then my second question really quick maybe one for irene i guess when you guys originally said you do not expect a provision expense this year i originally thought you meant zero but obviously it came in below that is it fair to assume that a or is it fair to expect a negative provision expense in the back half of the year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc ken my original expectation was that it would be zero along with your expectation and interpretation of our guidance i think at this point given our portfolio given the trajectory were comfortable with say a zero provision for the second half of the year depending on the economic outlook largely for the different models that we run driven by the unemployment rate the year treasury spreads gdp growth i think its within the realm of east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 possibility it could go negative but certainly i think from our perspective we want to be cautious with the provision and the negative provision so im comfortable with the zero provision for the second half of the year operator the next question will come from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess my first question more on liquidity and when you look at the commercial customers that are stepping back up and borrowing today are they doing so while still keeping high levels of liquidity on their own balance sheet and how should we think about future loan growth will that potentially be offset by potential deposit outflows with the loantodeposit ratio normalizing irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc jared well a lot of the new growth that weve had and the balance increases that youre seeing on the ci side in particular is really new customer acquisition i think if you look at it and if we look just in general for our ci customers overall utilization rates are pretty flattish and overall when we look at the financials of our ci customers we agree right people have a lot of cash they have a lot of liquidity and thats one of the reasons the utilization rates arent increasing but the balance increases are really from new customer acquisitions hope that helps clarify your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah yeah but i guess okay yeah thats good and then on the fee income side great growth on fee income and good guidance there are you seeing a sort of pentup demand coming out now that things are starting to release or is this just more of a good return to normal and we should see a steady march higher from here as volume and capacity continues to increase dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well im pretty sure that some of them is just a bit of a rebound from in terms of when there are more vaccination and then the economy opening up a little bit to a certain degree theres that but i think again going back on the east west bank perspective we have brought in a lot more new customers and also as i shared earlier from the crossborder banking perspective we have actually not just crossborder banking actually many of our more sophisticated largersized clients are signing up with our cash management services that maybe two three years ago certain type of deposit was still reside in some of the money center banks and many of them were willing to move more and more of that deposit to us and giving us a larger wallet east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 share and that drives these additional fee income in the treasury management services and then of course on the foreign exchange because that there is so much more crossborder both from a consumer and commercial side in addition to that in terms of wealth management again thats a share bringing in more customers because that really isnt related to more sophisticated platform and so forth its just bringing more customers and so we expected that well continue to execute in this strategic direction and our focus is continue to be a diversified portfolio of client base to allow us to not have to over rely on any concentrated growth risk and thats the game plan operator the next question will come from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc hi guys this is the vilas abraham in for brock just maybe starting off on ci growth again so obviously very good it sounds like customer acquisition is the driver which is great and your pricing was also pretty stable quarteroverquarter have you had to make any tradeoffs on pricing or structure to keep some of this momentum going that youve seen dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we have again going back to a very diverse diversified group from industry perspective from geographic perspective there are always some type of business that like all the community banks or maybe regional banks are all heavily engaged in and for those business there are some competitive pressure there are others like some of our crossborder business that we hardly have any competition that we do not have as much pressure but all in all i think having a diversified portfolio of ci loans and with many different sectors allow us to somewhat blend it into where we are today so i looked at it is that theres always going to be pressure here and there but then well we have very unique value propositions in some of the sectors that allow us to get to kind of like pricing that may get worked out so thats why you see that there is stable type of loan yield vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just my second question can you talk a little bit more about east west cre business in texas that you alluded to in your remarks how should we think about the strength of that economy and the migration into that state as it relates to ph your guys portfolio thank you dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well our texas team is doing well doing very well in fact well obviously we would take that oil and gas aside because thats where we are trying to make sure that we hold it below billion and thats so far going pretty well obviously the all the asset quality metrics improved much better but we put that on the side the ci and cre in texas are growing its a great market we have very strong talents in that region and we expect continued strong growth in texas operator the next question will come from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co first question just around loan pricing and given what the curve has done of late have you seen any change in terms of the competition on new business here more recently dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc there are always competition in particular in cre that sort of like keep going down in terms of pricing and so frankly we could have done a lot more if were willing to just go down the same path i think opposition is that by and large our focus on cres indiscernible our longtime existing customers and also continue to develop new relationship but to a certain degree we have valueadded services that allow us to hold the pricings maybe slightly better than the downward spiral that are taking thats going on around some of these other smaller community banks and thats something that we just dont think that is necessary for us to go down that path and i think that because many of those other banks so like based on the yield curve indiscernible price down and i think eventually when they the interest rate environment change it can hurt them in the long run so we are looking at both shortterm and longterm so and just do things prudently in the east west way matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then in multifamily you had a nice step up after remaining fairly stable over the last months have you changed your appetite there and where is that growth coming from within your markets irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah that growth is really coming largely from southern california and then also to dominics point earlier also our texas team as well but no change in our strategy or direction operator the next question will come from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc this my my first question would be on deposit growth that has been fantastic here i remember in the first quarter you said that was going to slow in and i guess technically it did but its still so congrats there i was just wondering how you see that momentum continuing into the back half of the year if youre expecting that to continue to slow but still remain strong and then if i heard you correctly it sounds like youre assuming slower securities growth in your nii guide so i just wanted to confirm that and then also could you talk about what kind of curve youre factoring into the nii guide as well thatd be great irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great questions dave our deposit growth theres no question with kind of the investments that we made the product offering the space that were in crossborder customers were acquiring new customers with that said and we see that more strongly with the transaction volume the product utilization and just the fee income from that but with that said theres no question the kind of macro environment and the other drivers are contributing to excess kind of liquidity that some of our clients have i think what were really pleased with as far as the deposit growth from consumer and small business and our retail branches corporate deposits commercial deposits theyre all growing nicely and the fee income and the core operating accounts are growing so were pleased about that but also kind of realistic as far as there is some excess liquidity here and some fluctuations with some of our customer balances and i think thats why were taking maybe more of a at this point in time especially where the yield curve is kind of a cautious approach as far as redeploying some of that longer into securities well still continue to do that as i mentioned but maybe not at that same pace that we did in the first quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay and then on the rate side youre assuming the current curve persists or indiscernible irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc current curve thats correct david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah current curve east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and then appreciate that and then maybe just my second question can you just quantify the growth you guys saw in loans and deposits in hong kong and china in thatd be great thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc growth in loans in hong kong and china was pretty good this quarter about million or so on the deposit side a little bit of an increase but not as much so we ended probably about one point excuse me billion in hong kong and china combined operator the next question will come from elan zanger with jefferies please go ahead elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc thanks hi good morning everyone just back on the loan growth i just wanted to check in on the cre pay downs i think you youre expecting some elevated pay downs possibly in the second quarter did those happen did you see that and i guess whats the outlook going forward for that dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc some do some dont and so we expect that those who didnt pay down in the second quarter may pay down in the third quarter and so that is something that well see because oftentimes client intention may not necessarily always work out elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc okay to get to the expense guide it assumes a decent uptick in costs in the second half i guess whats driving those costs higher and does this kind of bake in some sort of pickup in travelrelated costs irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah we have in our kind of forecast assumed a little bit more travelrelated costs its already happening certainly not to kind of a normalized level but ill just kind of maybe remind you like for the first half yearover year compared to last year were at that so its really kind of steady from where were at right now most of the cost increases that we have are related to compensation employees new employees that weve hired were making more money so bonus accruals are higher there are investments that we made in technology and were amortizing that but as you know we are very kind of careful in our expense management and we expect that well continue to do so dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc were also giving more money to charity too and were doing well we need to give back to the community operator the next question will come from brandon king with truist please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so with good morning yes so with the implied and improved operating leverage and the updated guidance could there be any plans to pull forward any planned investments dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc what do you mean by planned investment can you maybe help us define it a little bit brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah so i mean so the ongoing investments in the business but with operating leverage improving could you potentially pull forward any investments lets say in next year or use in advance ph that youre planning on goal dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we continue to execute according to our strategic business plan and from a lets say technology investment standpoint or people investment standpoint we continue to just trying to do it in an orderly fashion and not necessarily that trying to accelerate based on any particular specific situation but of course if there are some i mean great opportunity out there that is available we are always open flexible and then somewhat entrepreneurial to take advantage of it but outside of any of that i think we just follow our strategy plan and execute accordingly brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and

22jul2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning maybe a longer term question on credit quality obviously the results have been fantastic in part because of the stimulus but when we think about the way your business is today and we kind of fast forward one to two years how are you thinking about the overall loss in normalized losses for east west today than maybe prepandemic irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats a great question i think if you look at our portfolio and categories of loans that we have the main category cre ci and sfr certainly historical experience that weve had from the residential portfolio has been excellent right losses have been really negligible on the cre side as well historically ex if you think about ex construction during the credit crisis our income producing cre has also the credit quality has been good particularly relative to peers i think on the ci side what were trying to do is make sure we dont have too many concentrations in one area or one sector to ensure that our credit quality is something that continues perhaps kind of the good trajectory we have right now so when we look at that were very careful and i think there were some questions earlier during the call as far as rate versus structure but particularly i think for the commercial loans cre ci were careful from the perspective of not giving up a structure or a ph covenants for rate christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and if i could just add kind of a modeling question i think you said of the tax rate do you have what the remaining associated indiscernible would be that runs through the pl irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah at this point in time we think its going to be about million for the rest of maybe a little bit more in the third quarter chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc million got it thank you operator the next question will come from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i had a followup on ci loan growth could you talk about the pipeline and the opportunity within some of the higher growth areas such as private equity and i think you called out entertainment and clean energy could you talk about that and any new team hires thats helping that growth dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we continue to sort of like strategically add new talents into various teams so for example but in entertainment actually we only add one fulltime individual however i think just that the team for the last six to nine months has been going very strong and what well find is that the beauty of this diversification strategy is that we have so many different industry verticals and we have so many well i wouldnt say so many we have quite a few a very attractive geographic footprint in various areas such as from new york to texas to washington state to massachusetts and then of course we got our lions share of business in the state of california and lets not forget that we do have hong kong and also offices in china so they at various time would have stronger performance one quarter over next so if you recall i think last year we mentioned private equity quite a bit the last six months they have not yet had the kind of strong performance like entertainment or clean energy but i would expect that maybe in the next two quarters ill start mentioning them again so we obviously have many different sectors that we can sort of like get the engine going and dont forget we had substantial balances in the manufacturing wholesale distribution and also even international trade so any different sectors can potentially rise up and it just i would say that but if you look at the second quarter entertainment clean energy and general ci related to manufacturing and wholesale all those are few that actually have better performance than the others but it will keep changing and it will keep changing thats the whole idea because they are all strong teams and one way or the other they are going to be quarters that someone is going to do better than the other and so forth david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful thanks for that and followup on credit quality you had called out the cecl day one reserve of is that still the right sort of benchmark to think about where the reservetoloan ratio should bottom out here irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i dont have a crystal ball on this i have to say that but when we look at and also i want to kind of point out the largest driver for this is really the macroeconomic forecast which is very different than day one cecl with that said i mean i think if you look at the trajectory of where were at right basis points and down from the peak earlier of close to basis points and cecl day one basis points i think its realistic that we can get down to that level david operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr dominic ng for any closing remarks please go ahead sir east west bancorp inc
