relations citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings before we get started id like to thank liz lynn for being such an incredible partner during these last few months i really enjoyed getting to know the entire citi team and im honored to be the next head of investor relations and i look forward to working with you all with that i will turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc so thank you jen and good morning everyone im delighted to join you today so lets kick off the call with what were seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before i give you an update on our results and priorities certainly the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence i particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond corporate client sentiment remains very positive with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving ma activity and deleveraging and consumer balance sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer net worth during the pandemic now all that said growth has come off the boiler pad we are watching three things very closely the slowdown in china and its impact on global growth inflation and supply constraints in labor materials and energy and finally what happens next with the us debt ceiling negotiations these are also the issues which repeatedly surface in our conversations with clients so turning to the quarter we reported net income of billion and eps of embedded in these results is a pretax loss related to the sale of our australia consumer business which marks going to provide the details on excluding this transaction our third quarter revenues would have been up over last year and our eps would have been citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 in the institutional clients group we grew revenues by yearoveryear as we continue to see strong client engagements with momentum in investment banking equity markets and securities services more than offsetting the decline in fixed income markets im very proud to tell you that it was citis best ma quarter and the second best investment banking quarter in a decade and lending in the icg grew again this quarter albeit modestly we also had a very strong quarter in equity markets with revenues up yearoveryear so despite that normalization in fixed income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of overall markets revenues were only down and they were up versus the third quarter of we continue to successfully execute on our strategy to grow fee revenue across the icg businesses for example while tts continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds our fees this quarter were the highest in a decade you can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing a dynamic that we expect to persist for the near future similarly we drove doubledigit fee revenue growth in securities services in the private bank as client assets under custody and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory in global consumer banking healthy consumer balance sheets and persistently elevated payment rates did mean that loan growth remained under pressure the other key drivers are a bit more encouraging however us branded cards purchase sales are well above levels and acquisitions across branded cards mexico and the asia hubs are also all now at or above precovid levels similarly we continue to benefit from doubledigit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise let me briefly touch on our us retail strategy now our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends digital deposits stand at billion having grown in the last year and we see more than two thirds of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint with about half of those deposits from our cardholders who did not previously have a retail relationship with us now obviously we were disappointed by googles decision to discontinue google plex but we learned a lot through the effort and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships so all in all we ended the quarter with a common equity tier capital ratio of on a standardized basis and our tangible book value per share increased to up over from a year ago so far this year weve returned close to billion to shareholders through a healthy dividend and share repurchases we remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness so overall im quite pleased with these results given the environment were operating in and while we have much work ahead were seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made now id like to update you on our strategic priorities turning to slide weve included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions weve taken to date against them and were going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure youre uptodate on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way and as you can see weve been hard at work acting against the priorities ive laid out the transformation the strategy refresh and our culture and talent now clearly the transformation is our number one priority right now citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 and key to that transformation is our safety and soundness and addressing the consent orders by modernizing our risk and control environment during the quarter we submitted our plans to our regulators and continue to have a constructive dialogue with them as we pivot now firmly towards execution were already well underway in the investment in our risk and control environment and we are really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort and we are moving with urgency we also continued to make progress refreshing our strategy in addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in australia were deep in the second round of bids for the remaining exit markets weve begun the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in asia and eliminate stranded costs and were really looking forward to bringing all the strategy work together for you on investor day and presenting our vision for the firm and as marks going to touch on weve begun executing on many of the decisions that weve already made including in tts wealth and commercial banking with investments in front office hires as well as enhanced digital product and service offerings and were already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses and finally turning to culture and talent we continue to attract highcaliber external talent whilst driving towards our diversity goals ensuring clear accountability and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a company its a new citi and all of this work has one overarching goal to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers we will update you with the metrics and milestones that well use to hold ourselves accountable so you can hold us accountable to them as well and with that let me turn it over to mark to go through our performance in more detail and then we will both be delighted to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you jane and good morning everyone starting on slide as jane mentioned citigroup reported third quarter net income of billion eps of and an rotce of on billion of revenues embedded in these results is a pretax loss of million related to the sale of our australia consumer business excluding this item eps would have been with an rotce of as a reminder while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business we did incur a pretax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that has built up over time and is already included in our capital upon closing the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized and we will release approximately million of capital allocated to the business revenues declined from the prior year excluding the loss on sale revenues would have been up largely driven by investment banking fees as well as strong growth in equity markets and securities services expenses were up yearoveryear and constant dollars expenses were up in the quarter on a yeartodate basis our expenses have grown by with two main drivers investments in the transformation including the six programs to address the consent orders which drove about of the growth so far this year and businessled investments which focus on our front office expansion in the investment bank wealth and securities services and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 so far this year we added over bankers advisors and other front office support in wealth including the private bank and the consumer wealth businesses and corporate and investment bankers globally in high growth areas including senior hires across tech healthcare fintech and private equity coverage in our services businesses tts and securities services we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates in consumer these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the custom cash card and installment lending as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience in addition there were also increases in volume and revenuerelated expenses as well as businessasusual expenses which were largely offset by efficiency savings as a reminder we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to selffund investments and now turning to credit credit performance remains strong with net credit losses of just under billion more than offset by an acl release of billion largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio quality in constant dollars endofperiod loans were down yearoveryear reflecting the impact of the australia exit excluding this impact loans would have been up yearoveryear driven by active client engagement in tts private bank and markets endofperiod deposits were up yearoveryear reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers finally as jane noted earlier we returned roughly billion in capital so far this year and while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders turning now to each business slide shows the results for the institutional clients group revenues increased yearoveryear and sequentially mainly driven by investment banking equity markets and securities services expenses increased with about half of the increase driven by transformation and the other half driven by businessled investments and higher revenuerelated costs partially offset by efficiency savings credit costs were largely benign in the quarter as minimum net credit losses were more than offset by an acl reserve release this resulted in net income of billion which grew in the quarter and on a yeartodate basis and icg delivered an rotce of for the quarter and yeartodate slide shows revenues for the institutional clients group in more detail on the banking side revenues were up in treasury and trade solutions continued growth in fee revenues of yearoveryear the highest quarter for fees in a decade reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition as well as a recovery in commercial card revenues however all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads driving total revenues down were continuing to see momentum across our payment business with growth in crossborder flows and growth in clearings transactions over the past year as of quarterend tts loans grew mainly in trade loans where our technology investments in supply chain and deep local knowledge are enabling us to meet our clients needs across the globe investment banking revenues were up yearoveryear largely driven by ma as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity as jane mentioned this was the second best quarter for investment banking revenues and the best quarter for ma in a decade private bank revenues grew driven by growth in assets under management loans and deposits reflecting momentum with new and existing clients this quarter we added almost bankers investment counselors and citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 other front office support and onboarded over new clients our investments in talent continue to drive growth which bodes well for our overall strategy in wealth corporate lending revenues were up primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale partially offset by lower loan volumes total markets and securities services revenues decreased from last year fixed income revenues decreased reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products however we saw strong activity with our corporate clients engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts equity markets revenues were up our second best quarter in a decade driven by cash equities derivatives and prime finance reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions this is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off in securities services revenues were up here we saw strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that weve been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients partially offset by lower deposit spreads finally looking at yeartodate results in icg weve seen a strong contribution from investment banking and equity markets as well as solid results in the private bank and securities services which help to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets turning now to the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars on slide revenues declined and excluding the loss on sale as solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads expenses increased with about half driven by transformation and the remainder driven by businessled investments and volumerelated expenses partially offset by efficiency savings cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter as a roughly billion acl reserve release more than offset net credit losses this resulted in net income of billion which grew and gcb delivered a rotce and a rotce excluding the loss on sale finally looking at yeartodate results weve seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year with purchase sales up relative to and acquisitions nearing precovid levels globally and the business delivered rotce excluding the loss on sale slide shows the results for north america consumer in more detail total third quarter revenues were down from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rate and deposit spreads that said we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in both cards and retail banking in branded cards and retail services purchase sales were up versus the prior year by and respectively with both above levels and in retail banking average deposits and within that checking deposits were both up aums were up and citigold households were up this quarter were also making progress on our us digital strategy us digital deposits grew compared to the prior year and installment loan balances including our flex loan and flex pay products have also grown substantially up compared to the prior year and over of these loans are originated digitally citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 on slide we show results for our international consumer banking in constant dollars revenues declined yearoveryear in the third quarter excluding the loss on sale revenues declined with a decline in latin america and a decline in asia looking at international consumer overall were seeing good momentum in investment management with growth in assets under management primarily driven by asia and the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs purchase sales grew versus the prior year and average deposits grew albeit at lower deposit spreads slide provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends credit remains favorable again this quarter across all regions and given the delinquency trends were seeing today we do not expect credit deterioration in the us portfolio in slide shows the results for corporateother revenues increased by over million driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio expenses declined by million due to the absence of the civil money penalty which we incurred in the third quarter of last year offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter but reflect the lower acl release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year finally ph ebt was a loss of million slide shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as noninterest revenues on a reported basis in the third quarter net interest revenue of billion declined roughly million yearoveryear reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates on a yeartodate basis net interest revenue declined by roughly billion turning to noninterest revenues on the bottom of the slide in the third quarter nonnir declined by approximately million yearoveryear driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the australia consumer business excluding the loss noninterest revenues would have grown by over million or driven by strong growth in fees in icg on slide we show our key capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio ticked down to during the quarter citi returned a total of billion to common shareholders in the form of billion in dividends and share repurchases of billion our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at and our tangible book value per share grew by yearoveryear to driven by net income before we move to qa let me touch briefly on our outlook for on the top line for total citigroup we still expect revenues to be down in the midsingledigit range on a reported basis excluding any divestiturerelated impacts on the expense side we continue to expect fullyear expenses to be up in the midsingledigit range excluding any divestiturerelated impacts as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses and we will continue to look for ways to partially selffund these investments over time with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research mark i wanted to ask about the net interest income it seems like overall it came in a little bit better than you might have expected when you spoke at the barclays conference in september can you give us a little more color on what drove the improvement in the core exmarkets nii this quarter and how that makes you feel about the setup for nii growing from here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure good morning john when we look at its on page we came in at about billion i think there were a couple factors that play through here one were the treasury investments that weve been making contributed to that as we put some of the excess liquidity that we have to work the second i mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in cards sequentially branded cards in particular up but also within that we saw some of the late fees and indiscernible fees in cards kind of play through as you know theres an extra day in the quarter and so the combination of those things contributed to the tickup here that weve seen in terms of kind of the balance of the year that all feeds into the guidance that ive given for total revenues and that really hasnt changed but we continue to look to invest in the cards portfolio through new acquisitions with the long term perspective of how we grow loans over time there john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and just as a followup on capital returns while your total returns is very healthy it doesnt look like it increased much from the billion that you did in the second quarter despite the fed lifting its restrictions is this something youre being conservative on given a lot of change going on at the company right now or as you free up capital from the business exits your stock is trading at a low valuation how are you thinking about allocating that freedup capital between investing in the business and returning it to shareholders mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so look our philosophy really has not changed on this in terms of youve heard me say a number of times that as we generate income as we utilize our dta over time as capital gets released from the transactions citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 that we do we want to ensure that were able to serve our clients we want to ensure that we can invest in the business and then anything in excess of that we want to return to shareholders so that perspective has not changed obviously the scb allows for us to take those decisions in the given quarter based on what were seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors i mentioned including the capital release in sacr and things of that sort and so well continue to take those decisions with that philosophy in mind which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi two interesting things ph outside wonder if wed get your quick comments on perspective one was you became the first custodian to receive regulatory approval in onshore custody business in china i wonder if you could frame perspective on how material that opportunity is and then the same kind of thing on your plans to enter the australian buy now pay later market and what that means for not just australia but more globally how youre viewing that in connection with the rest of your consumer business thanks so much jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thanks glenn so why dont i take that one in terms of our operations and business in china id say weve been in that country for years we understand the dynamics in the local market well were currently serving a very large number of investors in that market of the fortune corporates in china how they operate on the ground and gain access to chinas capital markets and were looking at were very happy to have custody license in china it will also help support our operations in hong kong and its part of the growth of our securities services strategy that weve got youve seen the benefits starting to flow through in this quarters results from some of those previous investments and this is just another one of the investments that were making in that business that we like a lot and we think were well positioned in and in terms of buy now pay later i think this is one where obviously were divesting our operations in asia on that front but weve certainly take weve taken the learnings from our operations throughout the asian region particularly been applying them to the us over the last few years so weve certainly not been sitting still in the us weve been building out our personal lending platform since and thats part of our broader digitization strategy in the us consumer weve been seeing very strong growth in our flex portfolios both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as american airlines and we work to expand with new partners in pos and one of the areas im particularly excited about is the partnering that were doing with the largest ecommerce player amazon on pointofsale lending for our cards customers and those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the states and into mexico and finally weve been expanding our product suite by developing offcard lending capabilities and i think as youve heard from mark ph our payments on installment loans to existing card customers of those total sales are in digital channels citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 so as we look at all of this i would say clearly theres a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay and were really on the front foot of this and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that weve been making over the last few years and well continue to do so operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc wanted to understand a little bit more about what you think you can do in the us cards business i know we just spoke a little bit about some of the things that you have been executing on but when i look at the card business while its up on a yearonyear basis it is trending a bit below some of the peers in terms of growth rates and then youve got the retail partner card program which has some opportunities there to in my opinion get a little bit of a refresh to be as dynamic as some of your bestinclass peers so wondering how youre thinking about that and as well on the deposit side in the us with google now partnership not going forward what are you thinking about with regard to leveraging your mobile app across the us in a way that might not be understood well by the investor community because it seems like youve got a great app and its just underpenetrating your opportunity set with your brand mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks betsy betsy why dont i get started and jane may want to jump in and ill start with kind of your comments related to cards and so look as i mentioned in my prepared remarks particularly when you look at us branded cards we did start to see a tickup there as it relates to loan balances the loans were up about yearoveryear they were up about quarteroverquarter what i think is really important here is the market reentry because as youre seeing purchase sales are up but payment rates are still quite high and weve got to see how stimulus and liquidity plays out over time and so what were focused on is how were reentering into the market and were doing that both through our custom cash launch which is helping to drive new acquisitions in fact our new acquisition volumes are back to levels over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards were being thoughtful about that so over the last five years weve been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balance transfers and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances and those things as you know will feed future average interest earning balances as our experience is that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time so thats an important step the second thing that ill mention is just to reiterate what jane pointed out which is were thinking about lending more broadly and were driving growth on card lending products like flex pay and flex loan and those dont citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 have promotional periods associated with them and they start to generate interest from day one and so were keenly focused on this were obviously a big player here its obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns but we need to be positioned to capture growth as the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes and we need to be prepared if behavior doesnt normalize as quickly as wed like with things like broader lending products operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport research james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning my question maybe just focused a little on rates i think were so focused on us rates but given your global exposure weve seen rate hikes in mexico brazil now were contemplating rate hikes soon in the uk how do we think about your rate sensitivity to the rest of the world and do you see some benefits coming up over the next few quarters on the nii side mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look i mean we have seen a number of rate hikes and then the talk of rate hikes here in the us as you look at kind of our ire that we report were not that sensitive to the short end or long end but that said rate increases are beneficial for us and so we are weve got a lot of liquidity thats available for us to invest as we see rates increase but also to have enough dry powder to ensure that were taking advantage of client demand as that starts to return as well but for our firm as you pointed out the global impact to rates is quite important and increases internationally help to fuel our performance in parts of the franchise like tts and elsewhere operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning mark thanks for your update on just the reiterated cost guide for this year and i know probably too early to talk about next year but can you just help us understand just the moving parts underneath incentive comp transformation and what we should be thinking about in terms of just run rate costs from here if we can even stay away from just kind of like what next year growth looks like but any color the question is coming up a lot for sure across the large bank group in terms of acquired investments versus other things going on at the bank thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure so look let me start by saying as i pointed out in prepared remarks our expenses in aggregate are on guidance so to speak both as it relates to the transformation expected spend which yeartodate is up as well as our total expenses which are up yeartodate again consistent with the guidance as i think about this those are two very important categories of spend as jane has pointed out transformation is our top priority and were going to spend whats necessary to get that done and we need to ensure that were investing long term across the franchise and so were going to continue to do that but i would also highlight that expenses is something that we control right so we are very deliberate about the spend that youre seeing and in fact im scrubbing we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 right to ensure that the dollars that were putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion that theyre necessary dollars to be spent and in doing that were also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities and in fact weve seen that play through the expense levels that you see today if you look at if we as we look at our expenses weve generated somewhere between million and million a quarter in efficiencies through right so expense management is something that were very disciplined about were very deliberate about and we handle that in a very controlled fashion recognizing the priorities that we pointed out im not going to give you guidance for i will tell you that our guidance hasnt changed for the balance of were obviously in the middle of our budget season right and as we firm that up and finalize that well share that with you and our investors more broadly operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi my question is for jane jane you said on this call its a new citigroup and im just referring to the 8k from august where it announced a bonus scheme for top executives apparently that will be broadened out to many more and so we as shareholders and those who represent shareholders we see this bonus scheme before we see the targets so i guess my question is do you have the targets and if so can you reveal those although i suspect that wont be until march or do you not have targets yet or whats happening because either way it doesnt feel good for us investors thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc oh well mike im actually really glad you brought this up as we obviously saw your note the other day if you bear with me for a minute lets just take a step back and start with our compensation philosophy because i think its really important for our shareholders to understand this so the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance based its aligned with the interest of our shareholders most importantly so first any of the deferred awards we have downside built in and we clearly saw this last year in the psu performance which paid out only of its target and then secondly the annual process holds management accountable for our results as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders so then if we then turn to the transformation program as i said in the opening there isnt anything thats more important than the successful execution of the program its our number one priority we want to make sure the bank is modernized in its risk and control environment and it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank the board and i hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution im certainly driving this program with urgency and i also need to retain key talent because its a pretty tight talent market right now as we all know and we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and to live with excellence so to hold people accountable and drive the outcomes we need both carrots and we need sticks and to your question were going to put in rigorous metrics to determine if the rewards get paid out at all and if so what percentage will be paid out and we laid out the criteria in the 8k and the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the board from myself and the other stakeholders involved and well make and those were obviously disclosed in the proxy et cetera so youll see them so as you can see i think the main message from citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected just as there were last year for the management and the leaders of the program im accountable my team is accountable and very simply we must and we will deliver operator your next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i just wanted to jane go back to you mentioned disappointment at google plex pulling out just talk to us in terms of did you view that as a critical client acquisition tool and given that thats not moving forward does that put some urgency in terms of other partnerships that you may strike to improve sort of the deposit gathering efforts jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes as i obviously as i said in the opening we were disappointed in their decision but it is just one part of our digital strategy we certainly didnt have all the eggs in that basket as weve been talking about for a few quarters now and what i am pleased is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the us its lagged other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension and also the growth in sticky digital deposits that were seeing in the us the piece i like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have as well as our own proprietary efforts so if i can try and make that comment a bit alive weve added apis which really make it very easy to operate with partners weve developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy thats things like realtime digital alerts partner branded communications and probably most importantly maybe this is the geek in me we put together new tech stacks and weve learned a lot about doing this but its very valuable for what were doing right now and for partnerships going forward so at the end of the day i think all the things that weve been doing both in some of the work with google but also with partnerships around the world is going to further our digitization strategy in us consumer continue helping us grow and drive the returns here and i would say were always feeling urgency in improving the performance the growth and returns in consumer franchises thank you operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 hey there matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so you submitted a plan to the regulators this quarter can you just give us a sense of when you expect to hear back from them and then what kind of things youll be able to communicate to all of us i know theres always limited abilities in what you can discuss about the regulatory stuff but what are some of the data points that youre looking for internally and what and when do you think you can share jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes i mean i think as you heard from me this is our number one priority i think its for the benefit of all of our stakeholders that we get this done with excellence and we get this done right and as we said we submitted our plan in the third quarter im personally very proud of it it is a multiyear plan as mark said it comprises six major programs and it will position us to operate with excellence in the years ahead in a digital world and in particular it provides very clear target stakes for our risk and controls and for our core operating model elements as weve said weve now firmly pivoted to executing that plan and i have to say we have a very constructive and frankly a really helpful dialogue thats been ongoing with our regulators so its not as if you submit and then you havent spoken this has been very constructive all the way through in terms of execution were kind of going full steam ahead here im really pleased with the caliber of talent weve brought in from inside and outside of the firm as mark talked about so we can ensure that were executing with excellence some of the areas are new hires in data and i think importantly were putting as much effort on culture as on modernization karen peetz and her team are ensuring we have the capabilities and rigorous governance so were executing in a very disciplined way we deliver the outcomes from the investments were making we put in a new accountability framework and i have to say our board is certainly holding us firmly and regularly to account so well be sharing more details obviously at investor day and as we go through this but i think the main message from me is we pivoted to execution and were getting on with this operator your next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jane just wanted to clarify on this compensation 8k that you talked about you obviously have youve always had bonuses for short term and youve had longterm incentive comp that you always paid your executives similar to everybody else so the transformation project seems to be over and above that shouldnt that be part of what longterm compensation and incentive awards are meant for im trying to understand what the logic behind adding an additional payment here is because thats what management has already been partly compensated for which is longerterm moves and changes in performance jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look i think its exactly as i well first of all thank you thank you vivek i think as i said earlier in answer to mikes questions we want to drive the program with urgency we need to retain key talent and it is a very tight citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 talent market as you know and i want to make sure that the that theres no question from anyone involved in these in the programs that this is their number one priority for the bank to execute this with excellence but there are both carrots and sticks here and those come through the individual program and the individual assessments that everyone participates in every year as well as in this piece so i think this is fully aligned with the shareholders interest you want to have management really incented to deliver this with excellence but equally with all the downsides if we fail to do so and the program is designed to do just that operator your next question is from the line of andrew lim with société générale andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hi andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk thanks for taking my question so its a bit of a technical one wondering if you could give a bit of a color on the sacr implementation for the cet1 ratio in terms of the quantum of the impacts and the timing of the implementation thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure thank you so look were working towards the mandatory compliance date which will be january of weve not adopted sacr early and we dont plan to obviously the impact can range from impacting risk weighted assets to impacting ones gsib score but like i said were working through that now im not prepared to share that with you but it is a factor in how were doing our planning and well share that when we adopt it at a later date operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jane how are you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us in looking at your global consumer banking business in north america in your supplement i think its page you guys gave us a nice breakdown between the retail banking citibranded citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 cards and citi retail services and i noticed that in retail banking there was a loss in the quarter and can you just give us some color on whats maybe driving that and just the outlook for that part of the business thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah on the retail banking performance the drag there is in part the higher expenses from the transformation spend thats playing through and impacting income there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just wanted to follow up again a followup to my other question and as vivek expressed jane and mark youve mentioned that you have to serve regulators number one i think thats clear to everybody on this call and then you mentioned serving stakeholders but i think the ph comp question really gets to whats being done for shareholders and shareholders have been left behind at citigroup over almost any timeframe and mark maybe i might disagree with the philosophy a little bit and your philosophy set is first serve clients then invest in the business then you do buybacks why you should have any change in your philosophy is because the discount to book value is just getting greater and greater your discount versus peer has increased citi has ph worstinclass returns adjusted efficiency and stock market valuation so why not a little change in that philosophy to more buybacks versus investing if you have such a great opportunity with your share price so what can you do from a symbolic nature like everyone gets paid in stock or what can you do about the capital freed up from the sale of australia and use all that to buy back stock or what can you do to show that obviously regulators matter stakeholders matter but what can you do to show that shareholders also matter given such the underperformance of the share price and then since youre only giving one question at a time just a little bit more followup on your us consumer strategy as far as digital deposits crossselling to credit cards point of sale with amazon a little bit more on that thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc okay mike its jane let obviously let me kick this one off unequivocally our shareholders are incredibly important to us and when we look at where were trading and the underperformance around that it is something that we are determined in the strategy refresh in the transformation work were doing and in the culture and talent work were doing to address this were going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers were going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns and youre starting to see where that is where were headed to with that from the different decisions weve already announced and obviously it will all come together on investor day but secondly were also going to do it by running the bank better and weve laid out on page of the presentation what are the different priorities so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit and i think it i hope its pretty clear in terms of the framework that were using and the principles around that citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 and in terms of as mark said from a not only unlocking the value that we see in citi which i really do think is pretty tremendous and im quite excited about its also then what will we do with our excess capital youve heard me say given where we trade so disappointingly below book obviously share repurchases make sense for our shareholders we also do have a healthy dividend yield but thats an important part of the mix but theres no question around the attractiveness for shareholder relatively of the stock buybacks and we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally and youve seen that with the decisions that weve made on the exits in asia on consumer and some of the other moves that we will exit the businesses we think are lower returning and reinvest where appropriate but well return that to shareholders and i can see my cfo is champing at the bit here to jump in as well mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks and i just i think you answered it very well ill just add a couple of quick things one that when we invest in the business towards clients or more broadly in the business were doing it where returns are above our cost of capital so were making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that were narrowing that gap to peers the second thing id point out is that in the first couple of quarters of the year weve maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the scb came into play and that is because our shareholders are so important and then the third as jane mentioned is that we have a skew towards buybacks again just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is so thank you for the question operator your final question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey thanks for squeezing me in here good morning jane and mark jane i was hoping to just ask on the wealth management opportunity this is an area we have great competitive intensity you have a large many large peers have been investing heavily in this space for years and i know youre going to cover some of this at investor day and provide more detail but just at a high level i was hoping you could speak to what differentiates citis value prop from some of the peers in the space whether you have the technology or infrastructure in place to support some of your growth ambitions and then just lastly whether you can engage in ma or is that precluded under the consent order if you were to look to expand into that arena inorganically jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah thank you so much steven so im pretty pleased around our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful we have a strong brand in amongst the affluent not just here in the states off our retail banking franchise weve got a very weve got a pretty heavily affluent base but around the world and when you go into asia in particular this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there weve also got real breadth of client relationships and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those four principles that we laid out for the strategy refresh we have commercial banking operations in geographies around the world that have been operating for many years now this is the engine of wealth creation citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2021 in the world and we have the relationship with the owners already and so the synergies that we will be able to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important similarly the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise all the way up to the ultrahigh net worth in the private bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we havent really invested in that elevator and thinking of it that way we have a great we have some great platforms our institutional clients business around the world means that weve got top two platforms for our private banking clients in particular to take advantage of but its also ones that our consumer clients have as well so the opportunity here is bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the us and in the global offshore wealth centers and i would also point the fact that were already the top three player in asia its not as if we dont have scale and that this is a startup business here and were already seeing that this is coming into fruition quickly we obviously announced the focus on wealth at the beginning of the year weve already acquired newto bank clients in asia so far this year that weve added over bankers advisors and other front office support yeartodate weve done one of the biggest tech releases for wealth in the third quarter of this year with over plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter so i think the fact that weve got all these different pieces were putting them all together is really giving us momentum and accelerating the opportunity for us and this is a trend the wealth trend is going to be one that is one of those unstoppable trends particularly in asia in the years ahead well look at acquisitions at the moment obviously its more focused around what are digital capabilities what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side and those arent just acquisitions its partnerships and the like that weve been investing in so that we really serve the wealthy clients across the full spectrum of their needs rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are in just the sort of investment products weve got the benefit across the board operator there
