first quarter earnings call i am joined today by our chief executive officer jane fraser and our chief financial officer mark mason id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom they contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our sec filing and with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jenn and good morning to everyone today im going to touch on the macroeconomic environment before i update you on the progress were making and then ill discuss the quarter while the macroeconomic performance was surprisingly asynchronized last year the overall story has been consistent of late one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer growth this year looks poised to slow in many markets and conditions are generally disinflationary were already seeing some central banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates in the us a soft landing is viewed as increasingly likely but we continue to see a tale of two europes with germany hurt by the weak demand for goods while southern european countries such as spain and greece benefit from stronger demand in services in asia japan is joining in the areas of bright spot and chinas economy has gained some more traction although its property market remains a concern amidst all these dynamics we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of citi to all our stakeholders i said will be a pivotal year for us as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities the transformation and the performance of our businesses and the firm last months marked the end to the organizational simplification that we announced in september the result is a cleaner simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy we are now more client centric were already seeing faster decisionmaking and a nimbler organization at work we have clear lines of accountability starting with my management team fewer layers increased spans of control and frankly much citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 less bureaucracy and needless complexity it will all help us run the company more efficiently will enhance our clients experience and improve our agility and ability to execute and while reducing expenses wasnt the primary driver of the program more roles were ultimately impacted than the that we discussed in january we also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by rightplacing businesses to better capture synergies exiting certain businesses and markets that just didnt fit with our strategy and rightsizing the workforce in wealth as a result of all these combined steps which include the simplification we are eliminating approximately positions which will generate billion of annualized run rate expense save the combination of these actions and the measures were taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive billion to billion in cumulative annualized run rate saves in the mediumterm we are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the transformation as you know given its magnitude and scale the transformation is a multiyear effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades weve made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms streamline endtoend processes and strengthen our risk and control environment all of which are necessary not only to meet the expectations of our regulators but also to serve our clients more effectively a transformation of this magnitude while its never linear so while weve made good progress in many areas there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting were committed to getting these rights and well look to selffund the necessary investments to do so turning to the quarter we had a good start to a pivotal year we reported net income of approximately billion earnings per share of and an rotce of on over billion of revenues our revenues were up over yearoveryear excluding divestitures which is primarily the billion gain from the india consumer sale last year our expenses were slightly down quarteroverquarter excluding the fdic special assessment services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns revenue is up for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients fees were up a pleasing for services yearoveryear driven by the investments weve made across our product offering platforms and client experience in securities services we took share again this quarter and in tts crossborder activity continued to outpace global gdp growth and commercial card spend remained robust we look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our investor presentation on services in june markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in while revenues were down as lower volatility impacted rates and currencies that was off a very strong first quarter last year we saw good client activity in equities and in spread products where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust we fully integrated our financing and securitization capabilities within our markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients the rebound in banking gained speed during the quarter led by nearrecord levels of investmentgrade debt issuance as improved market conditions enabled issuers to pull forward activity and after a bit of a slow start ecm picked up in the second half of the quarter notably in convertibles citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 our strong performance in both dcm and ecm drove investment banking revenue growth of and overall banking revenue growth of while ma revenues are still low across the street i was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter such as diamondbacks merger with endeavor energy and catalents merger with novo holdings we are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the ipo market in the second quarter in light of improved market valuations corporate sentiment is quite positive especially in the us and our clients around the world have very sound balance sheets we very much look forward to welcoming vis raghavan to citi to lead our banking franchise in early june like other new top talent whove joined the firm he will inject fresh thinking to help us achieve our firms full potential in wealth while revenues were down in the quarter we grew fees and gathered an estimated billion of net new assets over the past months as youve seen andy continues to form his team and is focused on three areas first rationalizing the expense base second turning on the growth engine by focusing on investment revenues and third enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience now these wont happen overnight but getting these things right will help us get more than our fair share of the trillion of assets that our clients have away from us and that will help us get our returns to where they need to be in this business in the medium term uspb had doubledigit revenue growth for the sixth straight quarter we feel good about our position and our resiliency as a prime lendcentric issuer and are seeing positive momentum across proprietary card and partner card businesses healthy spend growth persists in branded cards primarily driven by our more affluent customers across both portfolios increased demand for credit continues to drive strong growth in interestearning balances and while they are only a small part of our portfolio we are keeping an eye on the customers in the lower fico bands we also continue to see strong engagement in digital payment offerings such as citi pay as a pointof sale lending product which is easily integrated into merchants checkout processes and we are driving more value from our retail branches as well as getting the expense base right to increase returns there our balance sheet is strong across the board an intentional result of our highquality asset robust capital and liquidity positions and rigorous risk management during the first quarter we returned billion in capital to our common shareholders and that includes million through share buybacks our cet1 ratio ticked up to a preliminary and we grew our tangible book value per share to we have a great franchise around the world with great clients who are served by great colleagues im pleased with where we are and im excited about where were going with the organizational simplification behind us and a good quarter under our belt we have started this critical year on the right foot now while there will be bumps in the road no doubt we will continue to execute with discipline and we are committed to reaching our medium term targets with that id like to turn it over to mark and then we will both be delighted as always to take your questions thank you mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 thanks jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on our yearoveryear comparisons for the first quarter unless i indicate otherwise and then spend a little more time on the businesses on slide we show financial results for the full firm in the first quarter we reported net income of approximately billion eps of and an rotce of on billion of revenue total revenues were down on a reported basis excluding divestiturerelated impacts largely consisting of the billion gain from the sale of the india consumer business in the prior year revenues were up more than driven by growth across banking uspb and services partially offset by declines in markets and wealth expenses were billion up on a reported basis excluding divestiturerelated impacts and the incremental fdic special assessment expenses were up cost of credit was approximately billion primarily driven by higher card net credit losses which were partially offset by acl releases in wealth banking and legacy franchise at the end of the quarter we had nearly billion in total reserves with a reserveto funded loan ratio of approximately on slide we show the expense trend over the past five quarters we reported expenses of billion which included the incremental fdic special assessment of roughly million also included in this number are million of restructuring charges largely related to the organizational simplification in total weve incurred approximately billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters as part of these actions we expect approximately billion of annualized run rate saves over the medium term related to our head count reduction of approximately in addition to the restructuring we took approximately million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm including a reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures the expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the transformation this year and relative to the prior year the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume related expenses partially offset by productivity savings in the remainder of the year we expect a more normalized level of repositioning which is already embedded in our guidance therefore you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in line with our billion to billion exfdic expense guidance on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans where ill speak to sequential variances in the first quarter net interest income decreased by million largely driven by markets which resulted in a basis point decrease in net interest margin excluding markets net interest income was relatively flat average loans were up billion primarily driven by loans in spread products in markets as well as card and mortgage loans in us personal banking partially offset by declines in services and average deposits were up nearly billion primarily driven by services as we continue to grow highquality operating deposits on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics this quarter we adjusted our fico distribution to be more aligned with the industry reporting practices and now show our fico mix using a threshold across branded cards and retail services approximately of our card loans are to consumers with fico scores of or higher and we remain wellreserved with a reservetofunded loan ratio of for our total card portfolio citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 in our corporate portfolio the majority of our exposure is investment grade which is reflected in our low level of nonaccrual loans at of total corporate loans as a reminder our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario weighted average unemployment rate of approximately which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to as such we feel very comfortable with the nearly billion of reserves we have in the current environment turning to slide id like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet capital and liquidity we maintain a very strong trillion highquality balance sheet which increased sequentially despite this increase we were able to decrease our riskweighted assets reflecting our continued optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite strategy and diversified business model the foundation of our funding is a trillion deposit base which is welldiversified across regions industries customers and account types the majority of our deposits billion are corporate and span countries most of our corporate deposits reside in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world in most cases we are fully integrated in our client systems and help them efficiently manage their operations through our three integrated services payments and collections liquidity management and working capital solutions all of which greatly increase the stickiness of these deposits the majority of our remaining deposits about billion are welldiversified across the private bank citigold retail and wealth at work as well as across regions and products now turning to the assets side over the last several years weve maintained a strong risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities into highquality assets this starts with our billion loan portfolio which is welldiversified across consumer and corporate loans and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately years about onethird of our balance sheet is held in cash in highquality short duration investment securities that contribute to our nearly trillion of available liquidity resources and for the quarter we had an lcr of so to wrap it up we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet which is reflected in our highquality assets and strong capital and liquidity position on slide we show the sequential cet1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter first we generated billion of net income to common shareholders which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases which drove a reduction of about basis points third we saw an increase in our disallowed dta which resulted in a basis point decrease and finally the remaining basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in rwa we ended the quarter with a preliminary cet1 capital ratio approximately basis points or over billion above our regulatory capital requirement of that said our current capital requirement does not yet reflect our simplification efforts the benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy all of which we expect to bring down capital requirements over time so now turning to slide before i get into the businesses let me remind you that in the fourth quarter we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within banking and between banking services and markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationshipbased lending the impact of revenue sharing is included in the all other line for each business in our financial supplement citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 in services revenues were up this quarter driven by continued momentum across both tts and securities services net interest income increased driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads noninterest revenue increased largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers in tts crossborder volumes increased us dollar clearing volumes increased and commercial card spend volumes increased all of which was driven by strong corporate client activity in securities services our preliminary assets under custody and administration increased benefiting from higher market valuations as well as new client onboarding the growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investment in product innovation the client experience and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments tts continues to maintain its number one position with large corporate and fi clients and see good momentum in the commercial client segment and we continue to gain share in securities services expenses increased largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation cost of credit was million as net credit losses remain low net income was approximately billion average loans were up primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in tts average deposits were down as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients however it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow and services continues to deliver a high rotce of for the quarter on slide we show the results for markets for the first quarter markets revenues were down as lower fixed income revenues more than offset growth in equities fixed income revenues decreased driven by rates and currencies which were down on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year this was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income which was up driven by an increase in client activity particularly in assetbacked lending and we continued to see good underlying momentum in equities with revenues up driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives and we continued to make progress in prime with balances up more than expenses increased largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year cost of credit was million primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans in spread products that impacted reserves net income was approximately billion average loans increased primarily driven by asset backed lending in spread products due to an improvement in market activity average trading assets increased sequentially largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter markets delivered an rotce of for the quarter on slide we show the results for banking for the first quarter banking revenues increased driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending and lower losses on loan hedges as i previously mentioned corporate lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from investment banking services and markets investment banking revenues increased driven by dcm and ecm as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity particularly investmentgrade which is running at nearrecord levels advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year however in the quarter we participated in the pickup and announced ma across sectors including those where weve been investing such as technology and healthcare corporate lending revenues excluding marktomarket on loan hedges increased largely driven by higher revenue share we generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased driven by citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 actions taken to rightsize the expense base cost of credit was a benefit of million primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition the ncl rate was of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reservetofunded loan ratio of net income was approximately million average loans decreased as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency as we optimize corporate loan balances rotce was for the quarter reflecting a rebound in activity reserve releases and continued expense discipline on slide we show the results for wealth for the first quarter wealth revenues decreased driven by a decrease in nii from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs partially offset by higher investment fee revenue were seeing good momentum in noninterest revenue which was up as we benefited from higher investment assets across regions driven by increased client activity as well as market valuation expenses were up driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls as well as platform enhancements partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reduction as we continue to rightsize the workforce cost of credit was a benefit of million driven by reserve release of approximately million primarily related to a change in estimate as we enhanced our datarelated to margin lending collateral net income was million endofperiod client balances increased driven by higher client investment assets average loans were flat as we continued to optimize capital usage average deposits decreased largely reflecting lower deposits in the private bank and wealth at work and the continued shift of deposits to higheryielding investments on citis platform which more than offset the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from uspb client investment assets were up driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation rotce was for the quarter looking ahead were going to improve the returns of our wealth business by executing on our three foundational priorities as jane mentioned this will take time but over the medium to longer term we view this as a greater than return business on slide we show the results for us personal banking for the first quarter us personal banking revenues increased driven by nii growth of and lower partner payments branded cards revenues increased driven by interestearning balance growth of as payment rates continue to moderate and we continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes of primarily driven by our more affluent customers retail services revenues increased primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses as well as interestearning balance growth of retail banking revenues increased driven by higher deposit spreads loan growth and improved mortgage margins expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs including repositioning offset by higher volume related expenses cost of credit of approximately billion increased largely driven by higher ncls of billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing in branded cards the ncl rate came in at in line with our expectations in retail services the ncl rate of was slightly above the highend of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter reflecting historical seasonality patterns however given the persistent inflation citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 higher interest rates and continued sales pressure at our partners we now expect to be closer to the highend of the full year ncl guidance range for retail services this expectation along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios led to an acl build of approximately million net income decreased to million average deposits decreased as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business more than offset the underlying growth rotce for the quarter was we recognize that this business is facing a number of headwinds from a regulatory perspective and from higher credit costs given where we are in the credit cycle both of which are putting pressure on returns for the quarter and for the full year however this doesnt impact our longerterm view of the business we feel good about our position as a prime and lendcentric issuer we will continue to take mitigating actions to manage through the headwinds lap the credit cycle and drive more value from retail banking and retail services while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business all of which will ultimately result in a higherreturning business over the medium term on slide we show results for all other on a managed basis which includes corporateother and legacy franchises and excludes divestiturerelated items revenues decreased primarily driven by closed exits and winddowns as well as higher funding costs partially offset by higher revenue in mexico and expenses increased primarily driven by the incremental fdic special assessment and restructuring charges partially offset by lower expenses from the winddown and exit markets slide shows our full year outlook and mediumterm guidance both of which remain unchanged we have accomplished a lot over the past few years and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure the year is off to a good start as we are laserfocused on executing the transformation and enhancing the business performance these two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient agile company but a clientcentric one that brings together the best of citi to drive revenue growth and improve returns and we are on the path to reach our to return target over the medium term with that jane and i will be happy to take your questions citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions okay our first question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well you just finished your seven month of your org simplification and you said positions go away with billion of expense savings so thats very concrete but more generally after years of matrix structure down to five lines of business youre reporting these differently youre talking about them differently but the question that i think a lot of people have is are you simply reporting these lines of business differently or are you actually running them differently thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mike for the question the simplification that weve just gone through it is what we said it is it is the most consequential set of changes not only to the organization model that we have but how we run the bank its aligned the structure with the strategy its simplified the bank its eliminated needless complexity its created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance as you can see its increased accountability and very simply its just easier for our people to focus on our clients but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us so maybe if i try and bring this a bit more alive the first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the icg and pbwm layer and we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run endto end under the direct management of those five business heads an example being operations its enabled transparency greater accountability and this endtoend and total pl focus so focus on the bottom line and the returns driving growth expense discipline etcetera we also rightplaced businesses to align with the strategy so banking all being under one umbrella the investment bank the corporate bank commercial bank really helping us drive synergies there putting fs and securitization into markets so that we have a unified spread product there also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter so thats an example in the businesses but i do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change so by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer lighter management structure in place in the geographies thats enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management and weve eliminated the whole shadow geographic pl weve eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies and this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months and we also broke the regions into smaller lighter clusters and that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows etcetera were seeing around the world its just much nimbler the third piece we created the client organizations so that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firmwide to drive revenue synergies and then the governance has got a lot easier it took up a lot of time and weve given much clearer mandates and weve more than halved the number citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 of committees thats committeesplus that weve eliminated in the firm either by consolidating them or eliminating them the spans and layers if you exclude me of the firm now operates within eight layers that is a much much faster decisionmaking its much quicker to get execution done it also means that you can very quickly get close to where the engine room of the firm is weve got clearer accountabilities weve eliminated most coheads weve reduced matrix reporting weve got the producer to nonproducer ratio improved so all of this really means as ive said a clearer deck so we can be laserfocused on business performance in those five businesses and the transformation it already feels different around my table im much closer to the businesses and the clients it makes it much easier for mark and i and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company you dont have to go through these aggregated layers to get things done and were done as we said we would be at this point were wrapping up the final consultation periods not an easy few months for the organization weve had to say goodbye to some very good people weve put a lot of change through the organization and now as we close the chapter on this we look forward to being back in bau mode again continuing to drive improvements and simplification and processes and the like but now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes weve made in business and organization and moving forward operator our next question is from glenn schorr at evercore your line is open please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much yeah so i think it shows how much youve helped us see the simpler organization i think people have totally bought into the expense story so a lot of credit for you guys i think where i personally and others still have questions on is on the revenue side and getting to those to mediumterm targets so could you take us just conceptually where were going to where you think youll drive that growth from from this baseline where were at now and if you want you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things youre doing inside the investment banking line indiscernible jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc you snuck that one in glenn so ill kick off with some of this pass it to mark and then ill come back to banking so look we are laserfocused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium term and its not just the growth story but let me anchor it in those medium term return targets in services we want to continue around the mid in rotce banking should be getting to around markets to so wed like to see it at the higher end of that range uspb getting that back to the mid teens and then moving on to the highteens in the medium term and then lastly as andy and mark have talked about getting wealth to a to return in the medium term but the goals to the mid in the longerterm here citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 and were confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of to cagr in the medium term and thats a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses gaining share in others we have good client growth look at our win rate for example in tts at over weve got our commercial bank also bringing in new clients in the midmarket and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world but mark let me pass it over to you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure and good morning glenn and we appreciate the acknowledgment around the expenses as you know weve been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say were going to do there id point on the revenue line id first point to if you look back since investor day weve in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that weve given for the medium term so that to top line growth and yes it was a different rate environment but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength as you think about the guidance we talked about for this year we talked about the nii exmarkets being down modestly and so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the noninterest revenue and i think this quarter is a good example of where and how thats likely to play through so the revenue top line being up 3plus percent but when you look through each of the businesses and if you look on each of the pages where we disclose the revenue you can see the underlying nir growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages thats coming through as well so securities services up with growth in both tts between crossborder clearing commercial cards but also and securities services right with the growth that were seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody we expect that trend to continue with existing clients and new clients as well as how we do more with our commercial market commercial middle market business excuse me so nir growth there the investment banking piece is the other driver of fees were seeing that wallet start to rebound were part of that rebound the announced transactions were part of those in sectors that weve been investing in were bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that and even in wealth where were not pleased with the top line performance this quarter of down when you look through that we do have good underlying nii growth in the quarter in wealth and thats up yearover year and its in the area that andy and the team is leaning in on which is investments and not just in one region but across all the regions and then finally the uspb piece which is showing good nii growth as well so the long and short of it is that the growth thats implied in billion to billion is going to be continued momentum largely in fees helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that mediumterm target jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so let me pick up im sure jenn landis will give the evil eye for sneaking in a second question there glenn but let me pick up on banking and whats going on there so we have a very clear strategy that weve been executing over the last couple of years really to lay the foundation for growth in banking north america is our key priority its the biggest contributor to the global ib wallet tech healthcare and industrials are likely to constitute over of the fee wallet going forward so we have better aligned our citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 resources to position the franchise for this defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like ph energy investing in highgrowth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent financial sponsors are sitting on trillion of estimated five power which they are incentivized to deploy so theyre likely to be between to of global investment banking fees weve great relationships with this community weve built that over years and decades youre going to see us more active in the levfin space in the right situations for our key clients and well continue to ensure were wellpositioned and active around this important opportunity youll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class thats going to be an important source of liquidity for many clients and the middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity and our investment bank and commercial bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world and indeed the new org structure that i was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joinedup client centric strategic coverage across corporate commercial and investment banking so over and above the wallet recovery mark and i are going to be very laserfocused on ensuring that were driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity vis raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our banking franchise the momentum that weve been generating with the foundations weve been laying now the intention here from him is to accelerate that he will focus on increasing our performance intensity driving productivity and disciplined growth and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments fundamentally improving the operating margin generating higher returns and that allimportant fee revenue operator our next question is from betsy graseck at morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning or yes were almost pinging into the afternoon here jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi betsy mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc great to hear you betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i guess a couple of questions well so i know we talked through the institutional securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit could we dig in a little bit on the wealth side because the expense ratio there is running a little higher and so itd be useful just to understand the pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes absolutely and some of it just as a reminder the actions that weve been taking on org simplification and that andy has also been taking in the wealth business we will work through notice periods in the coming weeks and so youll start youll see the impact coming through in our head count numbers and in wealth in the expense base next quarter look as mark said in his opening and andy has been talking about this should be a sort of up to a pretax margin business andy is focused on rationalizing the expense base hes also as mark said turning on the growth engine hes enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience the heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients they are an extraordinary client base but theyre underpenetrated so a lot of the operating efficiency is frankly going to be is going to come on the revenue side here that said andys taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side mark let me toss it over to you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes yes i mean look i think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of is not yet reflective of the work that andy has been steadfast at there is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform thats important but i think coming out of the first quarter youll start to see some of the reduction in expenses thats a byproduct of that work and the work has been across the entire expense base in the wealth business so that includes nonclientfacing roles and support staff it includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors and those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters i do want to point out as jane mentioned this is a growth business for us and so you can see on some of the metrics on page in the bottom left some of those good signs of investment momentum and i highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish lowperforming or lowproducing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity thats in front of us so longwinded way of saying theres some operating efficiency upside for us for sure its a combination of the top line and the expense work playing through the balance of the quarters and the year here operator our next question is from jim mitchell at seaport global your line is open please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay good morning jane and mark i very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth but revenues are often dictated by the macro that is a little bit out of your control so can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses you have a range in of billion to billion so if revenues are coming in below the targets is it i guess a fair to assume youd be at the very lowend of that range or is and i think there is some revenue growth built in there so is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get to your targets in a tougher revenue environment thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 yeah look the top line growth as youve heard us say is a cagr of to weve put that target out there of billion to billion as a range of what were working towards weve given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the billion to billion reduction by then weve already signaled billion thats in front of us the reality is that if theres softness in revenues thats why we have a range obviously the volumerelated expenses would come down with any softness in revenue and depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening wed look at the investments that were making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what were seeing on the top line with that said weve got to continue to invest in the transformation were not going to compromise that thats going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right but thats kind of how the dynamic works theres a top weve got a mix of businesses that i think weve demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years and we expect for those to continue to drive some top line momentum but weve got levers in case they dont jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc got it operator our next question is from ebrahim poonawala at bank of america your line is open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you i guess just one question mark around capital so you talked about ph million over the reg minimum like you could easily be doing the buyback you did in one quarter if not more i know you dont like to talk about outquarters but give us a sense of the case this quarter should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase and if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure look you know and ive said it repeatedly jane has said it repeatedly given where we trade we think buying back is smart and wed like to do as much as we possibly can and as much as makes sense in light of the uncertainty thats out there we have run at about this quarter that does give us capacity above the but its important to keep in mind that theres client demand that will continue to evolve we want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us whether thatd be in markets or other parts of the franchise and then theres still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves the good news is we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the basel iii endgame proposal could evolve but that hasnt happened yet its not finalized its not in place yet and so we want to see how that continues to play out were obviously in the midst of a ccar process we want to see how that evolves and well continue to take the buyback decision on a quarterbyquarter basis but we recognize that theres an opportunity there and well get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 operator our next question is from erika najarian at ubs please unmute your line and ask your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good afternoon mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey so clearly the theme of this thats emerging on the qa is a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in line with the in light of the expense declines which is not really as analysts were sort of a little bit parroting what were hearing from longonly investors that havent yet jumped into the stock so to that end i guess im going to ask ebrahims question differently and then ask a question about card late fees how are you balancing clearly your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from million but growing revenues at a to cagr would mean potentially some capital plowed back into the business i guess how are you balancing that especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at citi than any other money center peer and could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and how that would impact the billion to billion for the year if we do get an earlier implementation in october mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thank you erika on the first part of the question id just remind you and everyone else that were playing for the longterm here right so we have set some mediumterm targets obviously jane has recasted the vision and the strategy i think were making very good progress against that but were playing for the longterm and what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise its why ive given you a range around the expenses at least in part its why ive continued to stress the importance of protecting the transformation and risking control spend and its why ive started the answer to ebrahims question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there where the returns to do so makes sense and so we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders and so well continue to do that its an everyday assessment its an everyday discussion with the teams frankly its why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that were using balance sheet with and ensuring that were driving broader revenues across the platform and so thats kind of how were operating in terms of making that tradeoff on a regular basis in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that were in in terms of the second part of your question around late fees we havent disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees what i would say is that we did and have factored that into the billion to billion and the only thing id add to that is it did kind of its being implemented a bit earlier than that what we had assumed but again its inside of the range of the guidance that ive given you for top line revenue for the year citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc as a reminder of our two card portfolios are prime and in crs where you tend to see some of the lower income households we do have that the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in crs so we want our customers to pay on time we have a number of mechanisms to do so but in terms of the economics i think we along with the rest of the industry will be putting in mitigating actions over time some of which weve already begun to implement mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good add thank you operator our next question is from john mcdonald at autonomous research your line is open please go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks mark i was hoping youd give a little more color on how youre feeling about the credit card chargeoffs you maintained the outlook for the year you mentioned the higher end on retail services do you still feel like youll see a peak this year and what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card chargeoffs this year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks john we have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively weve seen continued top line growth weve seen continued average interestearning balance growth weve talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize and weve seen that continue to happen the range that weve given on branded cards were inside of that range when you look at the spend across the portfolios the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else and so were watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have but again as jane mentioned we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with where were really seeing the pressure is where i mentioned in terms of retail services and so there the current ncls are higher than the highend of the full year range that ive given but if you look back that is not inconsistent with seasonality that weve seen in the past in that portfolio where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process and so id expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in q1 but also in q2 before coming down and then i still expect that in you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges but look the reality is that we continue to watch it and the factors that are out there that are important include how unemployment evolves what happens with inflation what happens with interest rates and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time i think the final point id make and i mentioned it in the prepared remarks is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect kind of multiple vintages maturing at the same time and youll recall and this is citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 an industry dynamic through the covid pandemic period losses were at an alltime low payment rates at all time high supported by government stimulus and now coming out of that were seeing the covid vintages mature albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal and were seeing the incremental acquisitions that weve done start to mature at their normal pace and so these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact and thats an important factor we cant lose sight of but the bottom line is that were watching it the macro factors matter we feel good about the quality mix that we have and well kind of see how things evolve from here john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and on the branded side you still expect kind of the peakish are you still inside of the range for the full year and expect you could move lower on the branded chargeoffs mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes i still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in branded operator our next question is from ken usdin at jefferies your line is open please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks can i follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you mark to talk a little bit about just cost of credit we did still see some card related build this quarter even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth so just from a bigger picture perspective how do you think continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure look i think that when i think about the reserve builds i think its the same factors that come into play so obviously the view on the macro is important and right now if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio the unemployment assumptions weighted is about the downside is about kind of weighted over the period and so ph build how that evolves will be an important factor how hpi evolves would be important consideration here for this portfolio but also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease and then the final piece is mix and its kind of related to that revolver point as we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers thats going to play into how much of a reserve from a lifetime point of view we have to continue to build and so its why i mentioned on johns question the importance of looking at the interest rates looking at whats happening with inflation watching the lower income customer base because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves but i will say ken as i sit here and think about what we have in the quarter i feel very good about the reserve levels the for combined kind of acltoloan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio and well continue to watch it citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and a separate question on tts that nii related to tts has been remarkable with rising rates this quarter granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there the first quarter that it stepped back im just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity the tts nii and what are your thoughts about that piece of the nii puzzle going forward thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure yeah i mean i think id say a couple things we do have kind of some argentina playing through the nii line i will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity and we have seen this is the corporate client it is an institutional client we have seen betas particularly in the us at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that we are seeing betas outside of the us continue to increase as it relates to the tts client base but all of that again is inside of the range that weve talked about i dont expect to see kind of yearoveryear growth on the nii line anywhere close to kind of what weve seen in prior years prior quarters just in light of kind of how the rate environments evolved and in light of kind of quantitative tightening and the impact on deposit levels the last point id make on this is we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits and that will be an important tailwind that kind of plays through operator our next question is from vivek juneja at jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you jane mark just a question maybe on argentina youve shown million in nii total net income benefit of million aftertax so probably implying about million million of noninterest income benefit which line item sorry which segment did that come through and is that sustainable mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look theres a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income including a tax impact on the heels of last year argentina devaluation activity thats in that line but the short answer is that if you think about the nature of the business that we do in argentina it is a big part of our institutional client relationships and the primary activities include some of the ttstype of activities that weve talked about so liquidity management payments custody within the services business and so youd see a good portion of the activity in argentina playing through the services business some of it in markets as well but again the majority of the activity in services operator great operator instructions thanks so much our next question is from scott siefers at piper sandler your line is open please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey everyone thanks for taking the question mark i think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning i guess i only ask because it looks like citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories if we potentially go lower in europe but higher here for a while in the aggregate do these kind of complicate your management or make you feel better or worse about the overall nii momentum for the company mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me try and take it in in two pieces i guess so one is if i think about how the rate implieds have evolved from the to to now something a little bit north of in the context of what i expect for our performance it doesnt have a material impact on the guidance that ive given of billion to billion and in part thats because as i think about the timing for the planned cuts which was generally backloaded as well as some of the other factors that play through so argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago if rates are a bit higher for longer well watch how the betas continue to evolve i mentioned earlier the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner late fees are actually booked in our nii line and so those factors put me in a place where i feel like there will certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curves evolves and therefore im very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is to answer your broader question in terms of kind of how we are positioned id point you to the 10k that we have thats out and in that 10k we offer as we have before a number of ire scenarios for plus or minus basis points and what it means for our business and if you look at it youll see that for the aggregate firm for citi us dollar and nonus dollar that were assetsensitive so as rates increase we should see an increase in our nii performance but if you look at the breakdown and thats about i think it was about billion or something in terms of the impact of that move but if you look at the breakdown what the breakdown will show is that for us dollar at this point were neutral so if rates were to go up rates were to go down no material impact as it relates to our revenue for the nonus dollar were still quite assetsensitive right and so that should give you some sense for and we recognize the limitations with ire it assumes basis point parallel shift across the curve to static balance sheet etcetera but that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business operator our next question is from gerard cassidy at rbc capital markets your line is open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi mark hi jane jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi gerard mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark can you share with us theres been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card chargeoffs and the credit quality there if we could shift over to the corporate side which obviously is very strong we have seen spreads narrow in the markets on highyield corporate debt leverage debt etcetera its very robust out there but around the global geopolitical risk do you think the spreads would be widening can you guys share with us what youre seeing on the corporate side in terms of competition ph our underwriting standard is getting a little bit weaker now as people are trying to grow their books what are you seeing on that front mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so look were still seeing good demand for corporate credit and what id say is that weve been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here weve been very disciplined in terms of the investmentgrade large multinationals that we serve and that hasnt shifted from an underwriting point of view we have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit and that i think will continue to evolve i think importantly as we think about our corporate lending activity youll note that actually weve been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet and part of that again is a byproduct of the revenue sharing that weve implemented where theres been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve and whether theyre positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have and so i think the space will continue to evolve i think theres been good healthy demand despite continued strong balance sheets and part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve and i think were wellpositioned to be thoughtful about that but jane you may want to add a couple points to it jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah look around the world the corporate client base and our commercial banking ph with market client base have very healthy balance sheets and were also seeing market access gradually opening up as well which is also helpful for to the quality issuers across all asset classes were seeing both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors the deals are well oversubscribed so thats also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs the other piece i just pulled out there as well is the recent large ma announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from ceos and boards and active discussions are increasing as supportive capital markets create confidence as people think about larger strategic transactions this is going to feed acquisition finance bridge financing and some of the highermargin capital markets and lending activity as well so as we look forward i think its recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from company just investing refinancing looking at where they can diversify their capital raising in different quarters but id just close by saying i couldnt agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility i think the markets too benign and its risk pricing on some of these factors operator our next question is from matt oconnor at deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi in your prepared remarks you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on slide here and was just wondering if you could elaborate on i guess what youre doing or trying to do differently on that front and if theres any meaningful financial impact thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah look i think matt as weve talked about many times the transformation is our top priority it will be for the next few years it is foundational for our future success both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium term financial path and weve been making significant investments behind it as well as not only on the consent order but also making sure weve got this modern efficient infrastructure and were currently deep into a very large body of work upgrading our data architecture automating manual controls and processes consolidating fragmented tech platforms and all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly not just the risk and control in the mediumterm and as ive said though there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation particularly related to regulatory reporting were committed to getting these rights the org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it the investments that we need we keep a close eye on execution making sure weve got the right level of resourcing and expertise and well invest what we need to do to make sure that we address these different concerns i cant go into much more detail in terms of csi obviously but something of this magnitude youd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i mean i think thats exactly right but youd also expect that in this type of environment and on the heels of the regional bank stress last year that were looking at stress scenarios were enhancing our ccar processes were enhancing our resolution to recovery processes all of those things just to kind of make sure that were shoring up capabilities and youd expect that across the industry quite frankly operator our next question is from saul martinez at hsbc your line is open please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good afternoon ill change tags a little bit here but im curious if theres any update on the mexican ipo and more specifically im kind of curious how set in stone the ipo process is you will have a new administration and even if its a candidate from the same party she may have a less confrontational view of the private sector perhaps be more allowing a local banks distressed value from buying a bank i guess if the facts on the ground were to change would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than the public market valuation citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc the guiding principle that we have and weve had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them we are we never say never but we are very focused on the ipo path here we believe it is the right one for our shareholders were well on track in the path in mexico were very pleased to bring ignacio deschamps in as the banamex chairman to help guide the ipo process we announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter were far down the path of the technological separation of both banks and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year obviously the election is coming up fairly shortly but were not anticipating that we would be deviating from the ipo path that is the path that we are on at the moment ill never say never but we do believe that this is the right one but well keep an eye on whats happening in mexico as we always do operator our next question is from chris kotowski at oppenheimer please go ahead chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc thanks just a quick one for mark previously youd talked about bending the cost curve between the third and the fourth quarter of this year and on this call i thought i heard you say its basically bent that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower from here so did it just happen six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc ill take it ill take that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i wanted that one mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc no i mean ill take the win jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc a downward trajectory from here through the end of the year inline with the guidance of billion to billion and so yes operator our next question is from steven chubak at wolfe research your line is open please go ahead citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good afternoon so mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey steven jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hello steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey jane hey mark did want to ask on defast and scb just recognizing this will be the last opportunity before the results come out the macro scenario fed assumptions look quite similar to last year but just given the significant transformation thats underway repositioning actions which admittedly depressed earnings last year want to get a sense as to whether there are any ado factors that could result in greater scb volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on longerterm trajectory for the scb just given the org simplification efforts that are underway mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah steven the first part of your question is impossible to answer to be candid with you right i mean its we obviously have an internal based scenario weve run we have a severely adverse scenario that weve run weve provided a balance sheet as part of the submission but ultimately the regulators have to run through their models the information that weve provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer and we dont have as much transparency to that as wed like and so really hard to call at this stage the second part of your question i think is spoton and i kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks in that we have the mediumterm targets that weve set and were still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy the evolution of the business mix and the business model the mix towards more consistent predictable and repeatable revenue streams that would impact ppr the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base thatll be lower when we get to that mediumterm period so all of those things the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the gsib score and the like and the freeing up of capital which weve already freed up billion or so and so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in and we believe will be beneficial to the scb over the mediumterm operator our next question is from mike mayo at wells fargo your line is open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi a followup mark you said tts where you said we will have growth in operational deposits and i was just wondering what gives you such confidence that you will or is that accelerating or the same pace or what citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc we have seen growth in the quarter in operating deposits the confidence comes from the focus that weve had with our existing clients as well as the growth weve seen with new clients doing more with existing in more countries more deeply penetrating the commercial middlemarket space and so weve been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also provide the most stickiness as it relates to that relationship and so yes the confidence is rooted in what were seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth including inside this quarter jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc its also a lot of the investments that weve been making fuel a lot of the growth weve got we have a market leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns good growth if its citi token services citi payment express clearing all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients and the stickiness of the deposits the operating deposits comes with that so we feel good about that growth and youll hear more about this as well mike in may the investor day in midjune which will be i think we hope will be very hopeful to everyone so you really get your arms around how this business operates makes money and see why we call it a crown jewel operator our next question is from vivek juneja at jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi mark completely different topic because i think i understood your answer to be just from my previous question to be the tax benefits so well leave it at that if its different then i need to go down that path but the question i signed on to ask was you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the privatelabel and the retail partner cards what is that percentage and how does it compare with what it was pre pandemic mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i dont we havent broken down the transactor versus revolver mix and so im not going to get into that i will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were prepandemic and leave it at that but we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which youd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously as a factor in reserve levels as i mentioned earlier operator our final question is from betsy graseck at morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh hi thanks so much i just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses i know in the past youve talked about the fact that will be a little elevated with the restructuring and you showed that was the million in the quarter and then when we look to we should should we still be expecting a stepdown in and is that stepdown just the elimination of the million or is there some restructuring that were likely to see in citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 as well in other words should i just fade sequentially to hit your annual number or is there a bigger stepdown in that i should still be expecting here thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure i think you should just fade it to answer your question very directly but id also point out that in q1 if you really look through to it it has the million of fdic charge in it and so when you back that out we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided right despite that im telling you the same im making the same point which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year and while there wont be additional restructuring charge there will be the normal bau activity around repositioning that plays through so hopefully that answers your question betsy the guidance still holds and the downward trend is what we are managing towards as we kind of play out the balance of the year operator there are no further questions i will turn the call over to jenn landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor relations global citigroup inc thank you all for joining us if you have any
