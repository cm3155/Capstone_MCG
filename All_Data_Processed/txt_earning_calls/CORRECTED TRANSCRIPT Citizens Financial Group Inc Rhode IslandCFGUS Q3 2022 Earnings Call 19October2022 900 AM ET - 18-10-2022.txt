margin fees and expenses were broadly stable and credit performance remains excellent we grew average loans and deposits as our liquidity and funding position remained strong and our cet1 ratio of is above the midpoint of our to target range our tce to total asset ratio sits at performance metrics include a net interest margin of and thats up basis points we had positive sequential operating leverage of we hit efficiency ratio below and our return on tangible common equity was around we built our credit reserves by million with our acl at and thats above the day one cecl reserve adjusted for the investors acquisition beyond these impressive financial results weve continued to make good progress in executing our strategic initiatives in consumer we launched citizens private client which will help drive wealth opportunities we migrated our national digital bank to a modern cloudbased platform we continue to grow share with citizens pay and were executing well on our expansion into new york city metro region citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 in commercial weve successfully integrated recent acquisitions like jmp and dh capital into our coverage and product model our ma pipelines are at record levels and our geographic and industry vertical buildout is delivering strong results in terms of market share gains enterprisewide were successfully wrapping up our top program while building out top stay tuned on that our nextgen tech program has really been the standout initiative that has been a gamechanger for us these programs demonstrate our mindset of continuous improvement finding ways to run the bank more efficiently so we can deliver positive operating leverage and selffund investments for our future were also doing some interesting things in esg such as developing our carbon offset program for clients as well as investing in a virtual power agreement that delivers clean energy and we have more interesting innovation in the pipeline as we look forward to q4 of we feel that we are well positioned to deliver strong results and to keep growing and enhancing our franchise value we are well prepared for challenges that may materialize in the macro environment with a really strong balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite but we also plan to keep playing disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives the current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver responsible sustainable growth one aspect that we emphasized in todays presentation is our confidence in the quality of our deposit base that weve been able to transform over time weve had good deposit stability over the past couple of quarters as some peers are seeing outflows and our deposit betas are back in line with the pack were seeing very strong loan betas and expect these to remain above deposit betas through assuming the current forward curve as a result our nim will continue to rise more gradually as time goes on weve also layered in sizeable net interest rate hedges to protect nim and rotce through if the fed reverses and brings down shortterm rates moving off of the zerobound for short rates has unlocked the value of our deposit franchise and significantly benefited our rotce with a clearer macro outlook and less market volatility we feel the value of our commercial bank buildup will also manifest benefiting further our rotce so very exciting time for citizens and with that ill stop and turn it over to john to cover the financials in more detail john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone first ill start with our headlines for the quarter referencing slide we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was net interest income was up linked quarter driven by a 21basispoint improvement in margin to and growth in average interestearning assets average loans are up linked quarter with growth in commercial fees were fairly stable down linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year and mortgage results softened a bit capital markets fees and service charges were stable we remain highly disciplined on expenses which are up linked quarter overall we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of linked quarter and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to we recorded a provision for credit losses of million and a reserve build of million this quarter which reflects an increased risk of recession partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix our acl ratio stands at up citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 from at the end of the second quarter and compares with a pro forma day one cecl reserve of approximately our tangible book value per share is down linked quarter driven by the impact of higher longterm rates on aoci we continue to have a very strong capital position with our cet1 ratio at just above the midpoint of our target range next ill provide further details related to third quarter results on slide net interest income was up given higher net interest margin and growth in interestearning assets the net interest margin is up basis points as you can see on the nim walk in the bottom lefthand side of the slide the healthy increase in asset yields outpaced funding costs reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet moving to slide with the current expectation for the fed to raise rates further we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in nii yeartodate and those benefits will continue to accumulate into the fourth quarter and compound into our overall asset sensitivity increased to approximately at the end of the third quarter up from for the second quarter primarily driven by the impact of variable rate loan originations our asset sensitivity will allow us to have further upside if the forward curve continues to move up we expect cumulative loan betas to exceed deposit betas through the rate cycle our interestbearing deposit beta is tracking well within our expectations and the ultimate outcome will depend upon the pace and level of fed rate hikes from here so far this cycle with fed funds increasing basis points since our cumulative interestbearing deposit data is well controlled at through the end of the third quarter on a sequential basis our deposit beta was we began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities we will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits we continue to execute our hedging strategy to managing a more predictable and stable outlook for nii as we benefit from the higherrate environment youll find the summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide in the third quarter we did an additional billion of hedges with a focus on extending our protection out through and beyond primarily through forward starting swaps we expect our nim to rise to or better by the end of and for our overall hedge position to provide a nim floor of about through the fourth quarter of if we see rates come down by basis points across the forward curve the floor could move higher with further hedge actions moving on to slide we posted good fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates these were fairly stable down linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year card fees were strong again this quarter while capital markets and service charges were stable focusing on capital markets market volatility continued to impact the bond and equity markets ma advisory fees picked up nicely but this was offset by lower loan syndication revenue amid increased economic uncertainty and market volatility we continue to see good strength in our ma pipelines which continue to build the strong pitch activity and a growing backlog while current market volatility may constrain the ability for deals to close capital markets fees citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 should see some seasonal improvement in the fourth quarter particularly in ma advisory and even more broadly as markets settle down mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment weighed on production volumes which more than offset the fact that production margins improved modestly this quarter but still remain below historical levels we are seeing signs of the industry reducing capacity which should benefit margins over time and servicing operating fees were stable wealth fees are million lower linked quarter given the impact of lower market levels on aum and in other income we saw a seasonal benefit from our taxadvantaged investments and an increase in leasing revenue on slide expenses were well controlled up linked quarter our top efficiency program is continuing to make good progress and is on track to deliver over million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year average loans on slide were up linked quarter driven by growth in commercial with growth in ci and cre given modestly higher line utilization and slower paydowns retail loans increased with growth in mortgage and home equity offsetting planned runoff in auto periodend loans were broadly stable linked quarter given higher than usual endofquarter ci line paydowns which were generally redrawn after quarter end on slide average deposits were up billion or linked quarter with growth coming from retail term deposits from citizens access savings and commercial banking deposits were broadly stable deposit costs remain well controlled our interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points which translate to an cumulative beta we feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment and our performance to date is reflective of the investments made to strengthen our deposit franchise since the ipo overall liquidity improved as we reduced our fhlb advances by billion and increased our cash position at quarterend moving on to slide we saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter but still very low relative to historical levels nonperforming loans were broadly stable at basis points of total loans given the higher risk of recession we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress in particular cre office leverage loans and selected nonprofit sectors at this point we arent seeing significant issues emerge also the leading indicators for consumer continued to be stable and favorable to prepandemic levels personal disposable income has declined from stimulusdriven highs but remains above the prepandemic average spending for travel and restaurants remain steady and above prepandemic levels while credit card and home equity line utilization are still well below prepandemic levels and retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels turning to slide ill walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter we continue to see very good credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios while we arent seeing stress in the portfolio at this point we increased our allowance by million to take into account an increased risk of recession partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a modest increase from the second quarter if you recall when we adopted cecl at the beginning of our coverage ratio was however given the investors acquisition and some shifts in the portfolio mix we estimate our pro forma day one cecl allowance to citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 be approximately the current reserve level contemplates the shallow recession and incorporates the risk of added stress on certain portfolios including those subject to higher risk from inflation supply chain issues and return to office trends moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio increased to which is slightly above the midpoint of our target range this combined with our strong earnings outlook puts us in a position to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratios were both reduced by the impact of higher longterm rates on aoci we have increased our heldtomaturity portfolio to about of total loans at quarterend which has helped to mitigate the impact of rising rates our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage capital allocation shifting gears a bit on slides and youll see some examples of the progress weve made against the key strategic initiatives and whats on tap for our businesses in the near term since we closed the investors acquisition in april weve been executing against a phased approach to the integration in the second quarter we began originating mortgages on our systems and since then we have completed the conversion of mortgage servicing we also successfully completed the conversion of more than investors wealth clients representing about billion in assets to our platform we have a lot more to do but im pleased to say that we are on track to complete the deposit and branch conversions in midfirst quarter we have included a highlevel integration timeline in the appendix on slide importantly we remain on target to achieve our planned million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of of which approximately will be achieved by the end of we also continue to expect that the integration process will come in below our initial estimates in the last few years we have launched a collection of new banking products and features that make it easier to bank with us last week we announced the next step in that evolution with citizensplus which provides financial rewards banking features and tailored advice that grows with customers from everyday banking to personalized wealth management this includes citizens private client our new expanded wealth management offering which will launch by the end of the year we are fully committed to driving momentum at our wealth business and as part of the launch we are hiring more than new financial advisors and relationship managers we continue to make meaningful strides forward with our national digital strategy and tech modernization earlier this year we migrated citizens access to a fully cloudenabled platform and we launched a national storefront adding mortgage and education refis to the portal over the next year or so we plan to expand our national storefront adding card and checking first and then wealth and citizens pay as we add products to the platform we have an exciting opportunity to build relationships across a growing national customer base our vision is to migrate our core branch deposits to this modern platform over time which will be a sea change in efficiency and flexibility in terms of implementing upgrades and enhancements citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 we are also growing our innovative citizens pay offering which is currently at about merchant partners and expanding across targeted verticals over the next year we are working to launch a new mobile app and a unique customer direct experience moving to the commercial business on slide over the past eight years weve invested heavily in talent and product capabilities in ma corporate finance bond and equity underwriting fx and commodities and so on despite the challenging environment we remained near the top of the lead tables consistently ranking in the top as a middlemarket and sponsor book runner and helping corporates and private equity sponsors access capital through the public markets we have also integrated our cash management and global market solutions as well with our coverage we are excited about the potential synergies from our recent acquisition as we target growth in key verticals the jmp acquisition gets us much deeper into the growing healthcare technology and financial services sectors expands our equity underwriting and adds research capabilities and dh capital expands our capabilities in the internet infrastructure communications sectors software and nextgeneration it services these businesses are exceptionally well positioned for when markets reopen moving to slide ill walk through the outlook for the fourth quarter we expect nii to be up roughly driven by the benefit of higher rates with the margin rising to the to range average loans are expected to be stable to up modestly as commercial growth is partially offset by auto rundown fees are expected to be stable to up modestly noninterest expense is expected to be stable net chargeoffs are expected to be approximately to basis points we expect our cet1 ratio to land near the upper end of our target range of to and our tax rate should come in at approximately with respect to the full year we continue to track well and expect to beat our fullyear guidance across key pl categories and performance measures we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for fullyear in excess of with fourth quarter sequential positive operating leverage of about we also expect to deliver a fullyear efficiency ratio of about with the fourth quarter coming in under and we expect to deliver a full year rotce in excess of with the fourth quarter well above both q3 and our medium term target range of to to sum up on slide we delivered a strong quarter amid a dynamic environment and we are optimistic about the outlook for the fourth quarter and into we expect to continue to see significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment our diverse fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business in particular is well positioned for when markets stabilize and our commitment to operating efficiency remains a hallmark we are well prepared for a slowdown in the environment with a strong capital liquidity and funding position and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth at the same time we are playing some offense executing well on strategic initiatives in each of our businesses that will deliver mediumterm growth and outperformance with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john alan why dont we open it up for some qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions your first question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler go ahead please r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everyone thanks for taking my question john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible could expand a little on your thoughts regarding nii dynamics into next year i thought the yearend margin expectation that was definitely a highlight and i think just generally your comments about loan betas overwhelming deposit betas sort of cumulatively those suggests some confidence that nii should continue to grow after the fed stops tightening but just would love to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes additional color you might be willing to add john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure so ill just break it down into two overall categories you got the net interest margin dynamic which is a big driver and were messaging that we expect our net interest margin to continue to rise i think loan betas in the last cycle for us were up near or so this cycle were doing some more hedging so you could see our loan betas dropping a little bit the nice part about that is that it provides that downside protection so youre going to see loan betas in the mid to sort of low to mid you compare that to a deposit beta that we previously message would be around or so rates have been up basis points since then i mean you can see our deposit betas maybe getting into the upper or thereabouts given cumulatively given whats going on with rates in the last in the recent couple of months so you take that dynamic and see cumulative loan betas and exceeding deposit betas and that drives nims higher were also remixing on the loan side into more variable youre seeing the strength of the multiyear investments on the deposit side playing out and then lets not forget the other aspects of the balance sheet where youve got securities book and that securities book is funded primarily by dda and some wholesale and so you can see the front bookback book dynamics really taking hold where you got securities yields on the front book in the fourth quarter somewhere between and and with a run off and so thats pretty citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 powerful when youve got essentially a strong dda underpinning whats going on there in the securities book so those are some of the net interest margin dynamics if you flip over to the other side of things where you see our opportunity for continued loan growth where youre seeing us rotate into more of a variable rate approach solid opportunities in home equity and other aspects in the retail side but commercial is were feeling optimistic on the commercial side and thats going to drive loan growth into itll be economic environment dependent and but nevertheless the underpinning of rising nims i think is really what gives us the confidence to continue to see that nii improving into r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect color thank you very much for that and i guess just the with rates having moved so much just curious about your thoughts on sort of the citizens access product what kind of trends are you observing about sort of the stickiness of those customers how much is loyal how much are sort of shopping for rates and are your tactics at all changing with regard to that product bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island brendan why dont you take that one brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks weve seen some decent growth in citizens access and the digital native customer still exists and out there and is waking up a little bit as rates have gone up so were its been a very very effective strategy for us the customers are loyal to citizens were seeing good augmentation from those customers a very real brand engaged customers and the customer base is growing so our balance growth is coming from both sides new customer acquisition and existing customers bringing us more as we brought rates up but most importantly it serves to sort of have an isolated deposit rates and strategy to protect the core bank from needing to bring in ratesensitive customers into the bank were really relationshipfocused in our core franchise and the combination of the health of our deposit franchise improvement led by dda and primacy of our customers has been really showing up well so our deposit betas in consumer are dramatically different than they were in the last cycle and its really for both of those points the turnaround in the health of the customer franchise in the core bank and then the effective strategy of using access hope to drive national growth but also to have a much more targeted and isolated way to grow interestbearing deposits that doesnt make us reprice our whole book so were really pleased with how its playing out and citizens access is right where we thought it would be and its being executed really well john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and then the strategic aspects of citizens access that over time is just a whole another benefit of that platform brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island correct i think thats what obviously weve messaged that on these calls before but the integration of our citizens access deposit platform with all of our national lending businesses to make our national platform much citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 more integrated and customer strategic john mentioned the launch of our new app and our cloudbased migration we are making really sizable progress on bringing together all of our national capabilities to deepen those relationships as well as just sort of the deposit angle that we launched with a couple of years back r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes perfect thank you very much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and thank you so much for the crisp and impactful messaging from this morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is for you bruce you have teased that your top is underway and as we think about how much youve improved the bank and john has certainly helped balance sheet and brendan and don have helped balance sheet positioning what is your vision for what top could accomplish so were looking at a bank clearly outperforming the market today outperforming expectations it feels like a lot of the big rates of change have been accomplished in the previous seven plans so thats sort of the genesis of the question what do you envision top to accomplish bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well erika i think when we ended up hitting top and top we were getting questions as to how much rearchitecture and reengineering of how youre running the bank is left is the are you now picking the fruit thats really high in the tree and yeah it was getting higher in the tree but i think what weve been able to do is exhibit this mindset of continuous improvement that were not going to be satisfied with how were running the bank and were going to look at all aspects in terms of how our staff and organized and our vendor relationships and other kind of efficiency new technology deployment to deliver more efficiencies and so over time thats just become part of our dna here and so were not going to rest and say well we just had another successful result with top lets take a breather you really cant take a breather because we have investments that we want to fund in our future the business initiatives that we list on a couple of slides in consumer and commercial and that requires net investment in capex and opex and in order to fund those things having these top programs and finding efficiencies to selffinance those investments and keep the overall rate of expense growth modest is the equation citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 that weve used to drive rotce from the when we started at the ipo to levels today so i think youre going to continue to see us pursue that mindset of continuous improvement and dont be surprised when we have a successful announcement and execution of top that there might be even more top programs down the road after that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just a few cleanup questions thank you so much for giving us a lot of color on the acl im wondering what the weighted average unemployment rate that you assume in the acl today and just john a quick cleanup question to scotts line of questioning as we think about the nii dynamics into next year what are you assuming about deposit growth and deposit mix shift bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just take the the first one is were using some fairly conservative assumptions when we set the acl so i would characterize it as a moderate recession rather than a short recession and the unemployment levels get up over is kind of where weve modeled it so we think were being fairly conservative but we reassess that each quarter so john ill hand the deposit question over to you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure and i think the some of the trends that youll likely see into the fourth quarter continue into but id say the couple of items id highlight are starting with the customer value proposition that youre seeing us continue to invest in its been multiyears to build this deposit platform and in both consumer and commercial those investments are coming to fruition and demonstrating themselves but were continuing to invest so youre seeing just poor deposit growth coming from that and you heard brendan and us talk about citizensplus as an example of the core growth that we think can give us some unique ability to take some share into citizens access and the retail cd arena is a place where we have taken that down close to zero and so that will come back a bit in that category lets not forget new york metro weve entered new york metro and were starting to see really nice uptake once we converted hsbc were going to convert isbc in the first quarter of so we suspect that were going to start to see some lift coming out of that and then just broadly in commercial the product and coverage investments that weve been making over the years and continue to make will offset what were building in all of what i just described will offset our expectation were going to have some dda migration as rates rise so thats built into our outlook and built into the nim guide that were going to have some realistic expectations of the migration so those are some of the areas i would highlight erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks so much operator your next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning some really good detail on credit back in the appendix page for retail and on commercial and obviously you guys have improved the mix in both areas over the last few years but are there any signs of weakness within certain kind of customer groups that you could point to and then like what leading indicators might you suggest that we watch and that you pay attention to bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start and then maybe turn it over to my colleagues for some additional color but matt i think what continues to be very positive is that the expectation that things will normalize back to precovid levels continues to be deferred and so were only seeing very slow migration in terms of consumer chargeoffs and npas and delinquencies its still kind of better than prepandemic period and i would highlight there that our focus on very high quality borrowers in these portfolios super prime and high prime those folks are still doing pretty well through the current environment and have a lot of liquidity and so we feel really good about where things sit in consumer similarly in commercial over time weve migrated to lend to kind of bigger companies so midcorporate space companies in excess of million in revenues and they tend to be more diversified and better credits and so we also see very solid performance metrics across all the things npas and chargeoffs etcetera on that side youve got to go to the usual suspects if you think the economy is weakening and that would be commercial real estate leveraged lending and then maybe certain sectors in nonprofit which weve heightened our monitoring in those areas but we dont see any smoke at this point so maybe with that let me turn it to don for additional color on commercial donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think you hit it weve actually activated our downturn playbook which involves a lot of incremental stress and a lot of incremental portfolio management a lot of incremental conversations with clients i think theres a couple pieces of good news just supporting the lack of deterioration in credit one is we think management teams going through the pandemic got incredibly focused on efficiency and their business and they cut costs and they automated and they built liquidity and they repaired balance sheets and they hedged and they did a lot of things that were prudent from a risk standpoint so theres a little bit of a buffer we think in the portfolio against what could be deterioration if we go into a deep recession id say the thing were most focused on is the real estate office portfolio given back to work weve got fully leased office buildings and those leases are running for a couple of years in the future but weve got lease rolls that were focused on and whether theyre going to renew or not i think just personally i guess i was in new york city yesterday people are back in the offices indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and the other thing is that high percentage of our office property is indiscernible citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah and then a lot of its suburban bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island so i would say its in the right places a lot of its in places which are in the southern tier and things like that so we dont have a lot of san francisco for example where theyre going to have theres going to be a lot of distress so msas are important in the real estate business bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and i think the leverage book is you always look at the leverage the sponsor leverage book our strategy there which is high levels of diversification our average hold is kind of million to million so we do a lot of leveraged finance but we distribute to of it and were not really seeing any kind of severe stress in the leverage book so we feel pretty good and all the early stats the quick class ratios the nonperforming loans the watched assets which we have very significant ph process around all seem to be in pretty good shape right now but were not asleep the other thing ill mention and john touched on this we are being incredibly disciplined on new originations were really not taking on any new clients right now were getting very focused on returns were actually commanding a higher level of pricing given the current market environment so were watching the front book very carefully also bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah how about you brendan brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say that the health of the consumer is still very very resilient having said that were doing a lot of the similar things that don is mentioning kind of putting in a proactive approach to a potential downturn so making investments and collections being ready for an inevitable tick in the wrong direction tightening some credit on the margins were being incredibly disciplined on where were lending right now to make sure that the returns are right and weve got deep real customer relationships and its within the risk profile that is within our risk appetite having said all of that with what were seeing kind of out the window today the consumer is still plus excess liquidity in deposits as a general statement and chargeoffs are still at to of the rates that they were pre citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 covid and were not seeing any meaningful signs of that reinflating if you look at the overall us the bottom decile or two of the country youre starting to see that excess deposits burned off and theyre living more paychecktopaycheck which is where they were precovid we dont overindex on that segment and so we indexed much higher and so were not seeing a lot of the pain that is potentially happening at the very bottom of the segment in the us flowing through anything in our book look were seeing some very very early signs that potentially were at the early days of a normalization credit card customers that pay in full each month that was about of our portfolio precovid its now at it peaked at so its down a tiny bit but its still significantly better than what it was before covid so were starting to see small signs of potentially customers getting to normal but i wouldnt say its accelerating at all its still very resilient and significantly healthier than where it was precovid bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right thank you very much that was well detailed bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all righty operator your next question will come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just wanted to follow up one on credit i think if i heard you correctly that your acl assumes a unemployment rate it just means i think cecl is still relatively new im trying to understand absent that unemployment rate expectations going materially higher just if you could give us the thought process around drivers of additional reserve build over the coming quarters is it the cre market is it home prices because what im trying to get to is unemployment at seems a long ways away if that doesnt go much higher what else would drive those results materially higher relative to where we ended the quarter john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah ill go ahead and start there i mean i think that first id like to just make sure were reminded so weve got basis points against the portfolio right now when you pro forma adjust that for investors and some other things you get our day one of about so were basis points over day one so that covers a lot and so were covering the environment that bruce described earlier i think you can and he also mentioned a few pockets of areas that were watching very closely so were watching the cre office space and were watching a few sectors on the ci side just reminding that were not seeing any when you look at where our delinquencies are were not seeing any early signs of any deterioration here but that could change and that could change quickly so were keeping a close eye on it but and as things turn well have those areas of concern that we were focused on in the pandemic which most of which got cleaned out and has improved over time but those thats the playbook well go back to well go back to those areas of concern and take it from there bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add that i think were feeling pretty good if you look at a scenario that says we get to a moderate recession and it doesnt get any worse than the need to actually keep building may lessen from what it was this quarter i think there was a reassessment but the feds going to have to stay at higher rates which probably increases the probability of recession a little bit and that was reflected in going up the basis points so youd have to see even greater convictions that were likely to hit a recession or the fed is going to go higher with rates which is going to have more collateral damage for the need to build on the macro outlook of course the other things that contribute to higher provision is loan growth so if we have loan growth and then i think also as john indicated if we have a kind of changing view on certain sector risks we already have overlays for example for the things we mentioned we have a kind of reserve built for commercial real estate office we think thats sufficient but our view on that could change over time so i think were kind of sitting at a pretty good spot now well have to wait and see what happens with the macro forecast in certain sectors and the amount of loan growth that comes through those things would determine whether we have to keep building the reserve and how much i would say that i think that the concerns that were going to be building the way we did during the pandemic and oh my gosh these numbers can be kind of a runaway freight train we dont see that at all at this point so i think those peers are overblown thats probably one of the reasons this cast a pall over bank stock valuations but at this point we dont see that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats a good color and just one question bruce on the new york strategy so once you complete investors integration first quarter next year give us a sense of like should we expect like are you adding new bankers what are the capabilities youre adding to their franchise just given how huge that market can be in terms of just market share gains not just for the next year but for the next few years here bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure so ill start and then maybe ill ask don and brendan to talk about their businesses but i think the theory has been that we bring a thoughtful approach to how we bank these markets we really understand citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 neighborhoods we understand individuals and we really tailor advise to situations to where somebody is on their life journey kind of where they reside etcetera and on the corporate side we also want to be that thought leadership position where were the trusted advisor to a company as they negotiate aiding its many challenges and trying to achieve growth and weve been able to stake out that ground successfully in the major cities that we compete in we do it well in boston we do it well in philadelphia pittsburgh some of our other big cities and so notwithstanding the fact that new york is a relatively crowded and competitive marketplace we think that our style can be successful in new york its going to take a little time we bought some good foundational assets we need to bring our additional kind of culture and approach and bring our broader product set so we can do more for customers and give them more advice and better capabilities better customer experience but we think well be successful in that over time so in effect this is a bet on ourself and so far everything is tracking exactly the way we had expected with little signs of green shoots that were kind of on to something pretty good with that let me maybe go to brendan first and talk about the consumer and the small business side and kind of where youre making investments and sign of a view of the future brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah were incredibly pleased with the start in new york city post the hsbc acquisition and as john mentioned too weve already started some integration with investors on mortgage and wealth in new jersey and some of the borrowers in new york were hiring so were hiring up investment financial advisors mortgage loan officers and business bankers were also restocking the retail organization and infusing talent across the board and so far it has really paid dividends the new york market and from a branch network standpoint is the most productive market out of any of our markets so far early days which is an incredibly good early sign and were getting a lot of customers coming back to us from some of the big banks including hsbc customers that enjoyed that we didnt buy but enjoyed the location and the people and were really starting to see some growth typically when you do a branch deposit deal you see some deposit runoff to the tune of to in the first year were actually seeing the opposite the underlying retail deposit base is actually net growing in new york right away and we didnt have any attrition post legal day one so theres a long way for us to continue to build share thats early signed but were very bullish of what were seeing so far and in the investors franchise id say they kind of lead business banking more than consumer and were excited about that we think the investors capabilities and their distribution can help us accelerate our business banking strategy overall across the franchise and then when we put our consumer playbook on the investors franchise were seeing a big benefit already on hsbc and they were principally a retail franchise when we put that on the investors franchise that didnt have a meaningful retail presence the difference from what we bought and what we can build over time is even more substantial so were very excited about it theres still a lot to do but early signs are very positive bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island don donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah i would point at three things one is the ability as you said goes to deliver a much broader product set into the existing investors franchise so great expanded treasury services capabilities for example ability to hedge directly for clients and thats well underway and we will pick up a lot of very good bankers from the investors side so our workforce kind of quadruples overnight just with the acquisition second thing is were going to benefit on the commercial side from all the branding that brendan is doing so the visibility in new york city of branches at advertising and the like is the name recognition is helpful so we dont have to explain who citizens is to potential new clients and we are we are also hiring we announced yesterday a new market head for new york city metro which came from jpmorgan so weve got a new leader in place in new york and were off to the races bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color thank you so much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bruce good morning john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc first kudos for a very good slide presentation you guys gave quite a bit of detail its one of the best out there so thank you john talking about your hedges that you put into place slide gives us a good breakout of what you have in place can you show what those obviously its protecting should rates start to go down i would assume in late and into what kind of rate environment would work against what you just put into place or what youve had in place and you put more into place this quarter what kind of rate outlook would that this would not really work that well with citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean well let me just start off with i think that the point of getting those hedges on in the third quarter was to allow ourselves to continue to participate in with rates rising and so that the intent of all of that was to look past this next year into and and say if in fact we end up with a lower regime in those years lets try to find ourselves into a floor that would help maintain the level of rotces that were trying to achieve and so were stabilizing revenues and stabilizing our returns by doing this now of course theres a tradeoff that tradeoff is if rates instead of beginning to come down in they were to remain high or go even higher that would be an opportunity cost but nevertheless on an absolute basis we get very attractive returns being locked in through this strategy and i think thats really what were trying to achieve bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thats gerard its tricky youre trying to find a sweet spot and youre looking at the forward curve and talking to economists looking at economic forecasts and leaving yourself enough upside participation for high rates but then also recognizing that theyre not going to stay up forever in trying to floor out your downside and so time will tell hindsight is always if you went through earlier you missed the window if you had held off another six months could have gotten better levels but right now we feel weve done a pretty good job of as you can see from the results today were still asset sensitive were still benefiting as rates go up and now we can sleep at night that were not going to see rotce slide down the pole if rates turn around and go back down gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and is it safe to assume all the counterparties or the major global investment banks in these hedges john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes exactly gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay thank you and then just the second followup question obviously youre not an advanced approach bank and therefore the aoci is not an issue with your cet1 ratio which is the binding constraint for most banks or all banks when do you think people start to get a little concerned about the tangible common equity ratio citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yours is still very healthy but is there i know its an accounting issue we all get that but do you think it will be a concern if it gets too low and do you have any idea what that rate might be and then second john when you accrete the aoci back into capital as the bonds pay off do you know about how much will start coming in starting maybe next year in terms of the aoci and coming back into capital bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe ill just start to say that we did put the tce to ta ratio into our presentation deck today because we do think its worth keeping an eye on that and some folks in the peer group either have bigger securities portfolio or didnt put as much in htm and the tce to ta ratio sliding quite a bit ours is sliding a little bit but still appears pretty healthy you could argue that if thats not a regulatory ratio its not really something to worry about significantly because it will turn around over time its just effectively youve got these securities that are going to be earning you less than if you were able to take the cash and reinvest at todays levels so anyway i think we feel good were above in historical times its kind of been a marker and i think we can sustain it there we have about of the overall portfolio in held to maturity and well have to see where rates go but if they go up a little bit from here were going to continue to generate capital we think we can keep it at pretty healthy levels john ill turn it over for you for kind of the turnaround and the rest of the answer john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah great and just to supplement the earlier one i mean weve got our heldtomaturity is around right now and sort of balances that a little bit from to that point as well as it relates to how the aoci will come back in if rates kind of move around on us just the way to think about it at september we have about billion after tax sitting in that number and that will come in over about five years so that gives you an ability to work through that hopefully gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great no thats very helpful thank you guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning this is brian wilczynski on for betsy i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the expectation to resume buybacks in and just some of the puts and takes there you were just talking about capital a moment ago obviously your reg capital position is quite strong today but at the same time the macro citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 backdrop is still a bit challenging so was just wondering what makes you comfortable at resuming buybacks at this stage thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure so we are kind of at the north end of our to range and we indicated we would expect to land there at the end of the year so i think if you look at our target range relative to peers weve been a little on the conservative side which i think has served us well and particularly going into an environment with a significant amount of uncertainty thats the position we want to be in having said that you can see the level of profitability we have now is very significant so were generating a huge amount of tangible equity each quarter this quarter next quarter and so we could certainly blow past if we werent back in the market buying our stock so i think theres opportunity for us to even improve that ratio a little further and be in the market buying our stock the wildcard often is the amount of balance sheet growth and the amount of are there any acquisitions likely in the near term and i think on that score weve given you the guidance for what we see for loan growth so thats factored in and then id say on the acquisitions weve really only done very small acquisitions so far this year weve really been focused on making sure were integrating the ones we did last year we had a pretty banner year last year with the new york metro play and then jmp and dh capital and so we focus on integrating we feel really good about where those are and so nothing big likely before the end of the year even just in terms of the feebased deals that we do so i think we have the wherewithal to go out and build the ratio a bit further plus get in the market and buy back some stock brian wilczynski q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator your next question will come from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks i know were getting over an hour or so just a quick one followup on gerards question so how through the hedging program do you feel like you are at this point given what you show us on that slide have you kind of done what you need to do if not how much more might you think you need to still add to get that asset sensitivity to the position you really wanted to live in thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think this well there are many things that we consider when we work through this we think about the evolution of the balance sheet where we think rates are going to go etcetera but if you look at our most of thats on the short end if you were to say okay we know that the fed is not going to raise rates anymore and you wanted to take that down to neutral that would mean about billion or billion of additional hedging that would be necessary citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 and so but were going to be careful and methodical about that and update our balance sheet outlook update our asset sensitivity but theres still a significant amount of hedging left to do before we would say that were done with this cycle bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just a quick follow so john that point you made in the deck about nim floor of and a down basis points if the fed does hang high do you have an idea what that nim looks like in a down basis points scenario john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean its somewhere between the two right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i mean i think somewhere between the two i mean id say that that would be a better outcome for us and you could expect that that will be somewhere between the two the bps and book ends that we did ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thats fair all right just want to make sure that was it was pretty symmetric thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the capital markets side of business i know you indicated the expected seasonal increase in the fourth quarter could you help us size that up how you think about the magnitude there based upon your pipeline bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island john we had a little trouble hearing you indiscernible donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island so john weve got pipelines bigger than weve ever had on our capital markets side i think its important to kind of realize that the place we play is middle market and capital markets so the most troubled spots to generate revenue in capital markets is these very large ma deals which require very large financing so those are where were struggling with the markets so we were really pleased that we were able to hold cap markets kind of flat quarteronquarter given all the volatility in the market and we think most of the action is going to come in ma weve got a very big ma pipeline a lot of which does not require financing and it looks like its moving along quite nicely so its not going to double but we think it could go up million or million in the fourth quarter but well just have to see as we go through the quarter how much volatility and what the backdrop is but were assuming pretty big discounts to the pipeline in terms of what were forecasting right now so were pretty comfortable that were going to have a good quarter and then we do think well get a well do a little better now that the currency and interest rate volatility has come down a little bit that hurt us in the third quarter because people werent really willing to step into the market and hedge we think well do a little bit better on the market business also in the fourth quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would just add so we dont get carried away with dons sanguine outlook on commercial fees in q4 when we looked at our total fees at top of the house well probably still see a little leakage on mortgage production the good news here is that servicing has held up very strong and so our diversification has paid and can lend stability to mortgage but theres probably a slight additional step to take in q4 and then we did make some changes in our policies regarding overdrafts where weve done away with nsf fees and so that would clip the service charges line a little bit so youd probably see some strength in commercial offset a bit with a little fall in the consumer side but overall were guiding to the net of that should still be stable to up modestly and well just have to see how much of the capital markets pipeline as don said actually gets printed citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks hopefully you can hear me a little bit better one last question the have you sized up the size of the shared national credit portfolio and then also what percentage of that portfolio are you in the lead position bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think the shared national credit portfolio is a pretty decent size as weve moved up market but id point out a couple things there is that kind of when youre in shared national credits in general those are bigger companies that have multibank facilities and they tend to be better credits the second thing is that we continue to migrate towards trying to aim for the left lead position in those shared national credits andor be one of the book runners or admin agents so become a meaningful bank to those overall customers and so thats just been part of our strategy and were making good traction on that strategy i think a lot of times investors will think that the shared national credits is a particular point of risk our view is that actually its just part of a strategy and those are actually good credits and if youre getting to be in the drivers seat of leading the deals then thats the place you want to be john i think john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think thats right and its all about return against asset against deployment so underlying the vso strategy on the commercial side that weve talked about in the quarter is were exiting billion to billion a quarter of underreturning assets a lot of those are shared national credits which just havent panned out once weve been a relationship for a couple of years so that portfolio churns quite aggressively also and our ability to monetize through the products capabilities that weve built over the last five years is significantly different than it was five years ago we just have many many more opportunities to engage and become that lead bank with those clients john pancari q analyst evercore group llc that helps a lot all right thanks for taking my questions bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay sure i think thats the end of the queue on the questions so really appreciate everybodys interest and support have a great day operator that concludes todays conference call thank you for
