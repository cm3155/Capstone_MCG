behalf of all of us here at bny mellon id like to thank you for your leadership and for your many years of service to the firm and our clients for nearly four decades you made a tremendous impact on bny mellon and its evolution from the rather traditional commercial bank that we once were to the globally significant financial services firm sitting at the heart of the financial ecosystem that we are today when the board asked you to take the helm at a very challenging time amid a worldwide pandemic you not only navigated the firm through this unprecedented environment with a steady hand but you also continued to drive our client and growth agenda forward on a more personal note i want to thank you for working so closely with me during this transition i know it was always important to you to ensure a seamless transition before you retire and i couldnt have had a better partner on this journey having spent a meaningful part of the last four months meeting and listening to our employees clients and many other stakeholders im even more optimistic about the next chapter for bny mellon at the very heart of our firm lies an exceptional client franchise our clients truly view us as a trusted partner and a resounding message that i have heard is that our clients want to do more with us we have a growth opportunity by making that easier for them we have to do a better job connecting the dots both internally and externally and we will and while our investments over the last couple of years have paid off in the form of the remarkably resilient platform that we have today im also of the view that the efficiency opportunity available in driving our operating model transformation has more runway i look forward to formally taking on my new role at the end of august and will continue to share my views on our strategy and plans over the coming months moving on to the quarter ill start with some broader perspectives before i run through a few financial highlights and then ill turn it over to emily to review our results for the quarter in more detail during the quarter we continued to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets persistently high inflation rapidly evolving monetary policy around the world and all this against an increasingly complicated geopolitical landscape youve all seen those charts the sp had its worst first half performance in over years 10year treasuries had the worst start to the year since the beginning of the index in the early and with basis points in rate hikes this is the fastest tightening cycle over six months since the volcker era at the end of the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 underneath these headlines what were seeing across our platforms is that investors are clearly rebalancing and derisking were seeing asset reallocation from growth to value higher than expected cash balances and relatively shallow market liquidity making it harder for investors to move risk that said in our role as a critical infrastructure provider touching so much of the core financial system we do see today that markets continue to function in an orderly fashion trades are settling and fails and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels turning to our performance in the quarter and referring to page of our financial highlights presentation we reported eps of on billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of excluding the impact of notable items eps was and return on tangible common equity was our second quarter results reflect the benefit of higher interest rates the strength of our diversified platform and our unwavering commitment to our clients those clients clearly value our resilience the quality of our services and insights and the trusted relationship that they have with bny mellon while lower market values adversely impacted assetbased fees elevated volatility wider spreads and higher transaction activity across new and existing clients tempered the impact asset servicing continued to see healthy client volumes and our sales momentum and pipelines continue to be strong wins and mandates are up yearon year and thats broadbased across products and geographies producing a strong pipeline of auca to be installed over time and our retention rates continue to be exceptionally high north of in our etf servicing business total funds serviced are up yeartodate enabling etf auca to hold steady despite the impact from lower market values and in alts wins yeartodate have already exceeded all of its also worth noting that more than of our multiproduct deals have a data and analytics component as our da capabilities become more meaningful to our overall asset servicing deal pipeline in our markets franchise fx revenue was up nicely yearoveryear and the business continued its steady climb in the euromoney fx survey landing at number overall this year our highest ranking ever up from number a year ago and number in while also maintaining its top real money ranking issuer services and in particular depositary receipts had a solid quarter on the back of growth in dividend annuity fees and cancellation activity in pershing yearoveryear revenue was also up and were seeing encouraging signs in terms of sales momentum we continued to gather net new assets this quarter albeit at a slightly slower pace given the market backdrop but the pipeline for the second half and beyond remains strong as we continue to grow the core business and see renewed client interest in digital wealth solutions as well as the advisory tools we will offer through our pershing x initiative in a great one bny mellon example this quarter pershing and asset servicing combined their capabilities to roll out what is essentially a selfdirected vehicle for a large government agency offering choice of roughly funds to a total addressable population of about million eligible participants for the benefit of their retirement plan last month pershing hosted its insite conference with business leaders industry advocates and next generation talent this conference is a flagship event for pershing and we were pleased to announce some next generation tech solutions for advisors and wealth management professionals with the introduction of the latest generation of our pershing platform and enhancements to our api suite the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 turning to clearance and collateral management the business delivered another strong quarter of growth on the back of higher securities clearance volumes where market volatility continues to drive activity levels in us treasuries and we also saw average collateral management balances reach another record of trillion in the quarter driven by money market fund demand for the rrp facility treasury services also delivered solid growth driven by higher rates and higher payment volumes as well as broadbased growth across multiple products core us dollar wire debit card processing and immediate payments from both new and existing clients our investment management business was significantly impacted by lower market values the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar and clients derisking amid an increasingly uncertain environment having said that our investment performance remained strong with over of our top strategies by revenue in the top two quartiles on a threeyear basis insight was ranked first by greenwich associates for overall quality in ldi for the

direct social impact raised another billion in the quarter bringing total aum to over billion in just four months as most of you saw we also announced the sale of alcentra to franklin templeton at the end of may this transaction which is expected to close in the first quarter of builds upon our strategic relationship with franklin templeton as we will continue to offer alcentras capabilities and bny mellons subadvised funds and in select regions via our global distribution platform we will also provide alcentra with ongoing asset servicing support at closing we expect that this sale will increase the firms cet1 capital by about billion and it will free up seed capital to help accelerate our strategy of developing new differentiated solutions from our specialist investment firms that meet the evolving needs of our clients and finally wealth management continued to execute against its threepronged strategy acquiring more client relationships in the ultrahigh net worth and family office segments deepening banking relationships and investing in technology and driving efficiency as we engage with our clients in this space we continue to lead with some of the most innovative digital capabilities in the industry for a second consecutive year the financial times named bny mellon the best private bank for digital wealth planning north america recognizing our wealth online client portal and our proprietary goalsbased planning tool advicepath and the family wealth report recognized our active wealth accelerator as the best customer facing digital platform turning to capital despite the significant headwind from rapidly rising interest rates we remain well capitalized with healthy capital buffers to support our clients with a strong balance sheet in this volatile market environment the recently announced results of the feds stress test demonstrated once again that bny mellon has one of the most resilient business models and balance sheets in the industry and our preliminary stress capital buffer as calculated in the test remains at the feds floor and so as expected earlier this morning we announced that our board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend by to per share in the third quarter now before i turn it over to emily id be remiss not to also touch on our announcement last week that dermot mcdonogh would join us in november and become our next cfo effective february ive known dermot for over years and im really looking forward to his addition to our team and im also pleased for emily who after helping dermot transition into the cfo role will take on leadership of several of our key growth areas the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 namely treasury services credit services and clearance and collateral management reporting directly to me but in the meantime i certainly like reminding emily that she still has a few more earnings calls to go and so with that over to you emily emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good morning everyone as i walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise starting on page total revenue for the second quarter of billion grew by fee revenue was up this increase primarily reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers as well as continued underlying momentum across securities services and market and wealth services partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger us dollar and lower market values across both equity and fixed income markets money market fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense were million in the quarter an improvement of million compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by higher average short term interest rates firmwide auca of trillion decreased by as continued growth from new and existing clients was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and currency headwinds aum of trillion decreased by reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar investment and other revenue was million reflecting a quarter with strong trading performance as well as the benefit of a strategic equity investment gain which was partially offset by seed capital losses and net interest revenue increased by primarily reflecting higher rates and a change in asset mix expenses were up including the impact of higher litigation reserves a notable item this quarter excluding notable items expenses were flat quarteroverquarter as expected which translates to an increase of year overyear the yearoveryear growth includes among other items the impact of pulling forward our annual merit increase to the second quarter from the third quarter provision for credit losses was million versus a provision benefit of million in the second quarter of last year and they primarily reflect changes in the macroeconomic forecast our effective tax rate was the notable item increased our effective tax rate for the quarter by approximately basis points reported eps was pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was excluding the impact of notable items eps was pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was now on to capital and liquidity on page our consolidated tier leverage ratio was down basis points sequentially the continued sharp rise in interest rates in the quarter resulted in an approximately million aftertax unrealized loss on our availableforsale securities portfolio and we distributed of earnings to our shareholders through approximately million in common stock dividends our cet1 ratio was down slightly versus the prior quarter and finally our lcr was up percentage points sequentially turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page which i will talk about in sequential terms net interest revenue was million up sequentially this increase was driven by the impact of higher interest rates on interestearning assets partially offset by higher funding expense average deposit the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 balances and average interest earning assets both declined by sequentially loan balances grew by sequentially primarily driven by collateralized loans in wealth management and growth in capital call finance and trade finance our securities portfolio balances were down moving on to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were billion on a reported basis and billion excluding the impact of higher litigation reserves excluding notable items expenses were flat quarterover quarter as expected and up yearonyear this yearoveryear increase reflects investments net of efficiency savings the pullforward of our merit program as well as higher revenuerelated expenses the benefit of the stronger us dollar was largely offset by persistently higher inflation a few additional details regarding noteworthy yearoveryear expense variances staff expense was up driven by investments and the annual employee merit increase which in the prior year was effective in the third quarter distribution and servicing expense was up reflecting higher distribution costs associated with money market funds business development expense was up reflecting some normalization of travel and entertainment off a low base from last year and lastly the change in other expense was largely driven by the increase in the litigation reserves turning to page for a closer look at our business segments securities services reported total revenue of billion up compared to the prior year fee revenue increased and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as i discuss the performance of our securities services and market and wealth services segments i will focus comments on the investment services fees for each line of business which you can find in our financial supplement in asset servicing investment services fees grew by this increase reflects lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar and lower market values asset servicing continued to deliver healthy organic growth from both existing and new clients and our pipeline continued to grow across client segments and with particular strength in emea in issuer services investment services fees were up reflecting higher depositary receipts revenue and lower money market fee waivers partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed lost business in the prior year in corporate trust next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion an increase of compared to the prior year fee revenue was up and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances partially offset by lower deposit balances in pershing investment services fees were up the positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and higher transaction activity was partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year as previously disclosed net new assets were billion in the quarter in treasury services investment services fees were up reflecting the benefit of lower money market fee waivers as well as higher payment volumes on the back of growth from both new and existing clients and in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up primarily reflecting higher us clearance volumes amid elevated market volatility and continued geopolitical uncertainty all driving strong demand for us treasury securities now turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down fee revenue was down investment and other revenue was a the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 negative million which included seed capital losses as opposed to gains in the prior year and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher deposit balances as mentioned earlier we ended the quarter with assets under management of trillion down yearoveryear this decrease primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar as approximately of our aum are denominated in foreign currencies as it relates to flows in the quarter we saw billion of net inflows into long term products and billion of net outflows from cash ldi continued to be a bright spot among our active strategies with billion of net inflows and our index strategies gathered billion of net inflows as well in investment management revenue was down reflecting the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar lower seed capital results and lower market values partially offset by the benefit of lower fee waivers further to robins comments on our positive investment performance just this past weekend barrons recognized our dynamic value fund and income stock fund as two top performing active funds based on yeartodate results as well as longer term track record wealth management revenue was down as growth from higher net interest revenue resulting from higher interest rates and healthy deposit growth was offset by a decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market values the business has continued to increase the number of clients who use our banking services which is now at up significantly from a couple of years ago and client assets of billion were down yearover year primarily driven by lower market values page shows the results of the other segment i will close with a few comments on our outlook for the second half of the year as we all know the intersection of significant market volatility rapidly evolving monetary policy from central banks around the world continued geopolitical tensions and increasing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment has made forecasting difficult based on current market implied interest rates for the second half of the year we now expect the percentage growth in net interest revenue for the full year to be in the low compared to the prior year this improved outlook continues to assume modest deposit runoff in the second half of the year and it also assumes slightly lower deposit betas than previously expected which has been informed by our repricing experience to date since we last provided you our fee revenue outlook for the year on our first quarter earnings call both equity and fixed income market values have declined further and the us dollar has continued to strengthen significantly against most major currencies assuming equity and fixed income values as well as currencies stay at the level where they ended the second quarter we would project fee revenue for the full year to be flat to slightly up year overyear as it relates to expenses ex notable items for the year we continue to manage towards a yearoveryear increase in the to range continuously strong inflationary headwinds are expected to largely offset the favorable impact of the stronger us dollar revenuerelated expenses are increasing as fee waivers abate and were onboarding our strong sales pipeline and we continue to invest in the targeted growth and efficiency initiatives that weve highlighted before due to the impact of the notable item in the second quarter we now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be closer to taken together with our tax rate in the first quarter our expectation for a to tax rate in the second half of this year remains unchanged and last but not least we continue to be cautious on the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 buybacks in this volatile environment although based on current projections we expect to end the third quarter at or above our internal capital ratio target with that operator can you please open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions jim mitchell from seaport global please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning emily that was sort of intriguing i guess talking about your thoughts now on betas and the deposit declines and the higher nii so can you kind of talk about a little bit unpack that a little bit more in terms of whats changed over the last few weeks what youre seeing with after the latest rate hike and how youre thinking about nii from here emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure good morning jim so jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc morning emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp as you rightly point out weve increased our nir guide we now expect nir to grow in the low20 range year onyear and really the main things which have changed from a couple of weeks ago is that deposits havent run off as fast as we had expected also betas are coming in a bit lower than we had anticipated and also now baked into that our expectation that of course well get some higher yields from cash held at central banks just given the pace of monetary policy so those are the main drivers that are in the outlook for the full year and i would just obviously kind of caveat everything that theres a tremendous amount of uncertainty and its pretty unprecedented times jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats helpful and then just your comment of getting to where you want to be in the third quarter on capital if all else equal does that mean you would be thinking about indiscernible getting back into the buyback game in fourth quarter or is it still little too early to be calling for that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 so what weve always said in terms of capital returns and specifically buybacks that they would be dependent upon the trajectory for both aoci as well as deposit levels both of which were aoci was a bit it deteriorated this quarter and deposits were a bit higher as i just suggested its still an incredibly uncertain environment so of course were going to continue to be cautious we do expect deposits to decline and so we are projecting that well be north of our internal targets which of course for tier leverage is and we want to be north of our cet1 of on a sustainable basis and then its about that time that well start to talk about and think about buyback activity having said that as you all know its completely situational and very dependent upon the future outlook jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right fair enough thank you operator and our next question comes from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc robin hi robin i had a question for you its been probably more than five years maybe a decade weve all been getting questions on the threat of technology the threat of blockchain to your industry and it kind of comes and goes in waves and over the last two weeks i just got another barrage of questions in on this so i wanted to as your first call here as ceo incoming ceo can you give us your sense as to how you see the timeframe and the speed with which you need to be transforming the organization robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp sure so this is if you just step back this is a super interesting space in our industry and i think about it as once upon a time there was paper everywhere we had runners we had markets closing and we had the rise of computing and weve had traditional ledgers for the past years and now weve got a great new technology in the form of blockchain and that gives us the opportunity to do new things and were excited about that we think its going to bring great opportunity to our business youre right theres an element of potential disruption risk and so weve got to be ahead of that but we also see a lot of opportunity in everything that this brings to bear and ill just note that the amount of interest that we have from our clients in us helping them to navigate this landscape is really remarkable thats demand from the institutional clients around looking after cryptos which we view as interesting but not really the main core digital assets to building various different capabilities across the digital asset lifecycle coins tokenized assets the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 and weve really already cemented ourselves as a leader in the space with all the work that weve been doing for some of these stablecoin providers weve been doing our traditional business with them looking after traditional assets as part of their stablecoin portfolio but in doing so weve really inserted ourselves into the ecosystem and that gives us a great landscape so theres a lot to do here my view on this is its going to be years and potentially decades for the full effects to be known but were in it and were excited about it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the operating leverage as you go through this journey how do you think about managing that robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp this is a super long0term journey betsy i think its very hard to have a point of view but if i zoom out would i say at the margin its probably helpful longer term but im going to emphasize super longer term on that sure it probably should be because i think some of the inefficiency of posttrade processes you can squeeze more of that out with some of these new technologies and as was the case in the handover im sure from paper to original computer ledgers but this is going to be a while in the making and of course we are going to have to invest to get us from a to b on this thing betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp youre welcome operator gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning emily when you look at your fee revenue you gave us some guidance on if the markets dont change materially from where we are today by the end of the year and gave us that guidance can you remind us what percentage of fee revenues would you say are tied to values with a variable rate priced for your customers versus a fixed price emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp it really depends by line of business but for example when you think about asset servicing its about gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah go ahead im sorry go ahead emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i was going to say just to give a bit more color just in terms of unpacking that fee guidance because i think its probably helpful so when you think about now the yearonyear change of flat to slightly up about of that is coming from the abatement of waivers that is more than offset call it to from what i would call market factors and in that is market levels as you just suggest its also currency as well as the impact of geopolitical factors so for us obviously some of the impact the loss that we took on russia and ukraine and just ceasing business sic ceasing new banking business in that region but then that is offset by organic growth but it is still 50odd is expected to be between basis points to basis points and really we have very strong fundamentals across asset servicing treasury services ccm and even in pershing and corporate trust which are lapping some lost business from last year the fundamentals and the pipelines are strong gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and maybe for robin obviously disruption is going to create opportunities for some companies over the next to months to make acquisitions can you give us your thoughts on what you think you can add if you need something to the product set that bank of new york has robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i think about this pretty similarly to the way that todd and emily have described this before it is largely for us at least as we sit here today gerard an opportunity to acquire capabilities as you can imagine a large and transformational sort of transaction is not very high on my list of priorities right now im much more focused on the organic growth the opportunities that we have across the franchise and also just really driving the operating effectiveness of the company but as you saw last year we made an acquisition in the form of optimal asset management which sped us a little bit along on our journey on pershing x we made an acquisition in the form of milestone which was helpful and accretive to our business broadly in asset servicing and so were going to continue to be on the lookout for those types of things but as with anything in the ma space theres a high bar gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and todd good luck in the next run great job being at bank of new york thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 all right thank you so much appreciate that operator ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi thanks good morning and best of luck again also both of you robin and todd the robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thanks ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company emily on the deposit side can you talk a little bit more about you said your slightly different expectations for betas so im just wondering can you flesh that out for us in terms of how you think that projects and also can you help us understand the difference between how you might expect deposits in the us deposit side to act versus when we start to see the impact of the nonus deposit base move thank you emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so what are we theres a couple things in there so about deposits so i mean about the betas in particular so betas have been coming in a little bit better than we had anticipated call it or why that is certainly our thinking is that its probably due to a couple of factors certainly the sheer amount of liquidity thats in the system the risk off behavior that youre seeing just based on the uncertainty but also proactive management by us in terms of our deposit base and targeting operational deposits that we do want to retain we still think that ultimately betas will retrace what we saw in the last cycle although like i said theyre currently lagging what was actually anticipated its were seeing pretty much similar themes in both the us as well as europe what i would say is as the ecb gets to zero thats probably the toughest place to be for us and then as soon as they get negative sic positive we expect betas to also kind of largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle but thats basically what were seeing and thinking ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it and then any updated thoughts in terms of you gave us that update on where you expect deposits to be this year but on a throughthecycle basis do you have any way of dimensionalizing how you think total deposits might act through this cycle versus last as well in terms of either mix shift or total thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure so just a couple of things first thing i would just say is if we step back for just a moment and just remind folks about the central role we play in terms of liquidity across the financial ecosystem so we manage on any given day trillion in liquidity across our sophisticated clients so some of that of course is on balance sheet as were talking about the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 but theres also a significant chunk thats offbalance sheet we offer a lot of offbalance sheet options whether its our own money market funds thirdparty money market funds ficc repo the reason i say all that is just that as deposits move we will also get some benefit and see some of that moving around the system based upon where we are in what i would call each cul de sac so we can benefit from that and see all of that as cash moves around the system but getting very specifically into your question on deposits and deposit balances what i would say for this year and then ill talk about the landing point for this year assuming currently implied rates are realized we would expect deposit average deposit balances to probably decline another to from where they were in the second quarter and that was billion they just to give you some color in june they were at billion and on a spot basis theyre already below that some of that of course expected because of seasonally likewise just a reminder when you think about the components of our deposit base we would expect most of that runoff to be in nibs and so wed expect nibs to revert to about call it to of our total deposit base theyre currently about and then when you just think about the entirety of the cycle when were fully through the cycle and just putting it in perspective so between the fourth quarter of and the fourth quarter of deposits increased by about billion about of that was nibs they are of course as weve always talked about more ratesensitive and we would expect also given the change in mix of our business treasury services is a much bigger business asset servicing likewise is a bigger business so we think well be able to retain roughly twothirds of that when its all said and done ken usdin q analyst jefferies company great color thanks emily operator mike mayo wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes mike good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great just the big picture question back to robin we heard on the call today customers would like to do more business with bny mellon and that would be by connecting the dots and connecting the dots is a simple and powerful statement but also so extremely difficult to execute because these dots are in different business lines different geographies managed by different people so how are you able to connect the dots and really focus around the customer when so many of these businesses are in disparate parts of the firm just conceptually how do you attack a problem like that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp so yeah its a great question mike and its one its something that im really very enthusiastic about as a firm one of the benefits of having spent a lot of time really talking to clients over the course of the past four months and having worked across and really spent time with employees of all levels up and down the company internationally it has really been to be able to get into this particular opportunity that i highlighted that you just referenced and i feel weve got a few things that are really going for us so number one weve got this real differentiated trust from our clients and so theres a will to do more business with us and actually i get questions from clients that ask me that they want to do more business with us and theyre not sure how to do more business with us and so that frankly is a pretty differentiated situation to be in and i view that as a real advantage second we have a large set of related and interconnected businesses so its not like were trying to sell completely different products to people where its a real reach these are adjacent business lines so its collateral talking about margin its collateral talking about treasury services treasury services for wealth clients foreign exchange for treasury services clients its real adjacent things and so theres that opportunity as a result of the nature of the businesses were in and then third its actually the culture of the people we have people here at bny mellon who are client first firm second self third that is a very powerful cultural attribute and i intend to mine that and the other two things and ill just give you one example because i mentioned it in my prepared remarks but i think its a great example which is pershing and asset servicing came together over the course of the past few months to provide this new capability for this large government client that i referred to which has a significant addressable market for us but the interesting thing although the revenue hopefully will be interesting the really interesting thing there is how they came together and i think it is different than maybe the way it would have been a few years ago so im optimistic about this and well keep talking to you about it we call it one bny mellon and ill be pleased to give you updates along the way mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one followup on that just client first firm second self third how do people get paid for doing or how do you just from a 10000foot level how do you think about individuals getting paid for connecting the firm the way you would like because to the extent that incentives ultimately drive behavior if people get paid more for doing it theyre more likely to do it or maybe you disagree robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp well im not naive so of course financial compensation comes into it but on that hierarchy of client first firm second self third the compensation bit while important was in fact third on that list and people take a lot of pride associated with these selves and rallying around to deliver the firm for clients and so were going to do all of the above leverage the pride of our institution americas oldest bank the fact that we have this incredible connectivity with our franchise and of course well align appropriately the rewards both financial and nonfinancial to achieve those objectives the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator thank you operator instructions brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions i guess im curious on the relationship with fee revs and expenses it seems as though of course weve got a challenging market environment so not surprising to see the fee revenue pressure i guess just if you could update us on the thinking around the sort of rigidity so to speak of the operating expenses and whether or not theres an ability to do something given the challenging environment to ease some of that pressure a bit and i think you usually emily guide to core expenses so wed back out the charge this quarter but just to housekeepingwise confirm that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so theres a lot in there brennan so let me take a step back so just when you think about the to upside for the year its kind of very much in line with what weve been talking about since the beginning of the year any benefit that we are getting from currency tailwinds is being more than offset by much more persistent inflation pressure so if you just take that out of the equation the to up is about driven by higher revenuerelated expenses think distribution expenses associated with the abatement of money market fee waivers think clearing fees associated with higher volumes and also in that number is higher onboarding costs associated with the strong pipeline that were onboarding across various different businesses and so the remainder really relates to investment net of efficiencies as well as what i would call normalizing costs as we return to the office like te and occupancy et cetera and in terms of just kind of how we think about managing the cost base and when we think about the cost base in general its really three main categories that we talk about here one is the revenuerelated category the other is the structural or run the bank category its obviously difficult its a little bit more difficult to move in the near term and then theres the change the bank or investments the discretionary category as robin myself todd have all talked about before we see a lot of compelling opportunities very i mean id say a lot but weve been extraordinarily targeted in those opportunities pershing x future of collateral data and analytics et cetera and we will stay the course on those investments you dont just stop and start them based on the macroeconomic backdrop and they are important to the future of the firm having said that there are areas of course that we are pushing on and that we can hopefully accelerate from an efficiency perspective things like eliminating bureaucracy automating the manual processes that still we have across the firm optimizing our real estate and geographic footprint better scaling our vendor usage to get more the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 buying power reducing unnecessary temps and consultants all of those sorts of things and that could be meaningful in totality brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for all of that and we just the core part of the question this is you guys guide to core expenses right emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes im sorry yes it was core yes core ex notables correct brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc no i know i had a bunch of pieces so i wanted to make sure you got that okay no i appreciate all of that i guess when we think about the pieces of the expenses that are tied to the revenue and the pipeline and everything would that suggest then because the revenue trends have actually been adverse this year versus where we had started so should we be thinking that some of those benefits that where youre having some expenses or bearing some expenses this year would be coming in is that the deal or is the idea that the revenue thats tied to the expenses is getting offset by some of the environmental headwinds that weve all seen emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp well i mean just to remind you i mean the environmental headwinds meaning market levels and currency have been an enormous headwind so i mean thats the challenge very much this year yes it is fair to say that some of the cost base is just the normal upfront costs that we have in this industry for onboarding clients that you will actually see the fee revenue realized over and beyond brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator rob wildhack from autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research hi good morning you called out a nice to be installed pipeline auca can you just remind us how long that takes to get installed and start generating revenue and is there any notable difference in the profitability of some of the new wins like the etf business that you called out any more or less profitable anything like that worth noting emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so there are couple things in that question so when we think about i mean the tobeinstalled and how the timing of the onboarding is obviously just very dependent upon the business unit youre talking about but generally speaking its about a kind of anywhere from a 6month to a 12month onboarding kind of timeframe the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 and in terms of just the kind of how we think about the profitability and the fees generated from the pipeline in terms of etf et cetera robin if you want to robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i would say that we are very focused on the net margin contribution of new business that were bringing on we have a rigorous process to look at that as you look at the overall margin of the business i think were a bit victim of and that was choices at the time a business that was onboarded that wasnt always at the appropriate margin and so were were very were being very scrupulous about that as we look at the business coming in today robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and a quick one emily could you just quantify or did you quantify what the effect of that merit increase that was pulled into emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp it was about when you just in terms of the quarteronquarter variance robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks a lot and congrats to you and to todd and robin robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks rob robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thanks rob operator and our final question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great great thanks very much and i also echo my congrats and good luck for todd and welcome robin and also for emily thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 thanks brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc just a couple thanks a couple just a couple small modeling questions for emily and then a strategic revenue growth question for robin so just with emily just checking if your net interest revenue assumptions are using just the forward curve globally for central banks hikes and also if you can size the strategic investment equity gain in the quarter and then also on the issuer services that million was really strong is that a reasonable run rate into the second half emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp we got three questions there so first in terms of deposits yes we use the forward curve for all major countries and regions so it is global two what was your two sorry brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc just strategic investment gain that you called out the size of that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes were not disclosing specifically but it did it was part of the reason and a driver why investment and other income was million but weve also given you the normal run rate for that line so you can kind of think about what that would therefore mean but it is also worth saying that there were some seed capital losses net of hedges in that line this quarter that did not exist in the actually that were a gain in the second quarter of last year so all of that is playing through the investment and other income line and then your last question was brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the issuer services was emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc really good this quarter didnt know if that was emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good run rate yeah the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah no of course so in issuer services ultimately we had a better performance in drs than we had originally anticipated and just strong dividend activity some of that is seasonal that you normally just see first quarter to second quarter so thats really the driver brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then and robin if i could just finish on pershing x sounds like you are making traction there i know thats still like a twoplus year type of sort of materiality at least at the last earnings call so i dont know if you want to update us on whether you think that might actually happen sooner and then just on the organic growth which is looking like to basis points like you said for this year just with all of these initiatives do you have do you envision of where that organic growth rate could maybe go in the next couple of years sounds like theres a lot of exciting growth initiatives and business opportunities given how youve characterized it robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp sure so let me start brian with pershing x and so were very pleased with the progress that weve made ainslie onboarded in the second half of last year as you know she just crossed the ninemonth mark weve rounded out the management team we acquired optimal asset management we actually integrated our albridge business into pershing x as well which has been quite helpful because its quickly augmented the number of engineers an extra engineers into the mix and so weve had hands on keyboards writing code for the past three months on that we feel were very much on track and were expecting to launch a very early minimum viable product with a very small select group of clients by the end of the year on the business which will be helpful and weve been taking a lot of client advice along the way and have had a lot of client engagement which is helpful not only to make sure that were building exactly what clients want which as you know is the origin of the product but also of course helps us with sort of the early presale of the whole conversation so were excited about the direction of travel ill reiterate my prior point on the revenue though which is we dont expect to have a meaningful drop to the bottom line on this thing i said at the time for a couple of years that was a quarter ago so were still on that same track notwithstanding the fact that were going to be starting testing the mvp at the end of the year and is a multiyear endeavor for us and we remain excited about it in terms of organic growth sort of more broadly i will say that that comes in a couple of different forms of course weve got the interesting initiatives like pershing x like our investment in rtp weve also got it in the form of the margin walk that weve walked you through before in asset servicing which includes top line activity as well as the bottom line as we do all of that but so we got all of those initiatives those contribute to organic growth but we also think that to my conversation earlier on about one bny mellon that there is blocking and tackling which isnt necessarily glamorous but its important under the hood to make sure that we really are introducing all of our clients to all of the products and capabilities and platforms of bny mellon and im excited thats going to contribute growth as well over time not in position to give you a number today but i think itll be part of the equation the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thats great color thank you robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator and with
