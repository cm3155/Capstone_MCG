to treat one another with respect civility dignity especially when we disagree we cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us i truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society turning to our performance our second quarter results were solid we delivered strong yearonyear growth in both global banking markets and asset wealth management i am pleased with our performance where we produced a roe for the second quarter and a roe for the first half of the year we continue to harness our one goldman sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments in global banking markets we maintained our longstanding number one rank in announced and completed ma and ranked number two in equity underwriting our investment banking backlog is up significantly this quarter from what were seeing we are in the early innings of a capital markets and ma recovery and while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10year averages we remain very wellpositioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in activity we saw a solid yearoveryear revenue growth across both ficc and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients risk intermediation and financing needs we continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three of of our top clients in asset wealth management we are growing more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues which together were a record billion for this quarter our assets under supervision had a record of trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly trillion we delivered a margin for the first half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of awm the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 in alternatives we raised billion yeartodate we completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter including billion of total capital for private credit strategies and approximately billion across real estate investing strategies given the stronger than anticipated fundraising in the first half of the year as well as our current pipeline we expect to exceed billion in alternatives fundraising this year this is a testament to our investment performance track record and intense focus on client experience we are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset wealth management platform let me turn to the operating environment which remains top of mind for clients on the one hand theres a high level of geopolitical instability elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policy and inflation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated on the other hand the environment in the us remains relatively constructive markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near alltime highs i am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence recently our board of directors spent a week in silicon valley where we spoke with the ceos of many of the leading institutions at the cuttingedge of technology and ai we all left with a sense of optimism about the application of ai tools and the accelerating innovation in technology more broadly the proliferation of ai in the corporate world will bring with it significant demandrelated infrastructure and financing needs which should fuel activity across our broad franchise before i turn it over to denis i want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me first our recent stress test results the yearoveryear increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress weve made to reduce our stress loss intensity which the federal reserve had recognized in our last three tests given this discrepancy we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations despite the increase in requirements we remain very wellpositioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with our capital in the second quarter we repurchased billion of shares which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders despite the increase in our repurchase activity our common equity tier ratio ended the quarter at under the standardized approach basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter we also announced a increase in our quarterly dividend which underscores our confidence and the durability of our franchise since the beginning of we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level of a share id also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit in the second quarter our 25th anniversary as a public company we went public in which is also the year i joined the firm and its been an eventful years since then we have persevered through a number of significant global events including through the dotcom bubble the nasdaq crash september the financial crisis and the pandemic when i look back at how we overcame these challenges i immediately think of our culture one that has evolved no doubt but always stayed true to our core values i know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence maintaining our leading market positions growing our businesses and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people in closing im very confident about the state of our client franchise we are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths and effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 now let me turn it over to denis to cover our financial results in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the second quarter we generated net revenues of billion and net earnings of billion resulting in earnings per share of and roe of and an rote of now turning to performance by segment starting on page global banking markets produced revenues of billion in the second quarter up versus last year advisory revenues of million were up versus the prioryear period equity underwriting revenues rose yearoveryear to million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen though volumes remain well below longerterm averages debt underwriting revenues rose to million amid strong leverage finance activity we are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing which we expect to continue on the back of increasing ma activity our backlog rose significantly quarteronquarter driven by both advisory and debt underwriting ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter up yearoveryear intermediation results rose on better performance in rates and currencies ficc financing revenues were million a nearrecord and up year overyear equities net revenues were billion in the quarter up yearonyear as higher intermediation results were helped by better performance in derivatives equities financing revenues were billion down modestly from a record performance last year but up sequentially taken together financing revenues were a record billion for the second quarter and a record billion for the first half of the year our strategic priority to grow financing across both ficc and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base now moving to asset wealth management on page revenues of billion were up yearoveryear as david mentioned our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of billion management and other fees increased sequentially to a record billion largely driven by higher average assets under supervision private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to million our premier ultrahighnetworth wealth management franchise has roughly trillion in client assets this business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products a great example of the power of this unique platform we expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint our pretax margin for the first half was demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid mediumterm target now moving to page total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of trillion supported by billion of longterm net inflows largely from our ocio business representing our 26th consecutive quarter of longterm feebased inflows the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 turning to page on alternatives alternative aus totaled billion at the end of the second quarter driving million in management and other fees gross thirdparty fundraising was billion for the quarter and billion for the first half of the year in the second quarter we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by billion to billion on page firmwide net interest income was billion in the quarter up sequentially from an increase in higheryielding assets and a shift towards noninterestbearing liabilities our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion flat versus the prior quarter for the second quarter our provision for credit losses was million primarily driven by net chargeoffs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly million related to our wholesale portfolio turning to expenses on page total quarterly operating expenses were billion our yeartodate compensation ratio net of provisions is quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion and included approximately million of cie impairments our effective tax rate for the first half of was for the full year we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately next capital on slide in the quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock dividends of million and common stock repurchases of billion given our higherthanexpected scb requirement we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter we will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement our board also approved a increase in our quarterly dividend to per share beginning in the third quarter a reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our confidence in the increasing durability of our franchise in conclusion we generated solid returns for the first half of which reflects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy we made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams including record first half revenues across ficc and equities financing management and other fees and private banking and lending we remain confident in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders while continuing to support our clients with that well now open up the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi there thanks very much so i liked for forwardleaning comments on the ib fee pipeline and i think i heard you say the demand for committed acquisition financing is high does that infer anything about us being any closer to an inflection point in private equityrelated ma sponsorrelated ma and then how much of an event think you have as being maybe the big the only big bank that has a fullon private credit platform obviously dcm platform and lending platform thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure good morning glenn and thanks for the question were forwardleaning in our comments because we definitely see momentum pick up and i just again want to highlight something that was definitely in my part of the script and i think denis amplified which were still despite the pickup were still operating at levels that are still significantly below 10year averages and so for example i think weve got kind of another to go to get to 10year averages on ma one of the reasons that ma activity one of the reasons not the only reason but one of the reasons why ma activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate and so i think especially given the environment that were in that youre going to see over the next few quarters into kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity were seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors and obviously its been way way below the overall ma activity is kind of another to get to 10year averages but sponsor has been running below that and were starting to see that increase now as that increases i just think the firms incredibly wellpositioned given the breadth of both our leading position weve been top kind of one two three in what ill call leverage financed activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community but we combine it with a very very powerful direct lending private credit platform and so i just think were in a very very interesting position the size and the scope of the companies that are out there that have to be refinanced recapitalized sold changed hands sponsors continue to look distribute proceeds to their limited partners i think bodes well over the course of the next three to five years different environments but the general trend will be more activity than weve seen in the last two twoandahalf years glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that maybe one quickie followup on you mentioned in the prepared remarks that in your printed prepared remarks that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during quarter thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 sure glenn its denis i think the important to take away from the yearoveryear performance in the equity investment line is that in the prioryear period we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet and the results that reflect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period so that is i think a large explain of the delta operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just wanted to spend some time on capital post the scb increase one maybe just from a business standpoint if you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the firm has been leaning into the financing business do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual so one how does it impact the business and second denis your comments on buybacks moderating should we think more like levels of buybacks going forward thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure ebrahim so a couple of comments i guess first important to observe that the level of capital that were operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent with where weve been over the last several years so we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter which at basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise and with what were seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise whether thats new acquisition financing as david was referencing or the ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses we have the capacity to do that as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders given the billion number in the second quarter we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases but we still do have capital flexibility and based on what we see develop from the client franchise we will make that assessment well manage our capital to an appropriate buffer but were still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it so assume no change in terms of how were thinking about the financing business and just separately in terms of sponsorled activity we waited all year for things to pick up is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets does it speak to inflated valuations that they are carrying these assets on just would love any context there david if you could thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i mean i appreciate that i dont think its troubling i wouldnt use the word troubling but i do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound at the same point theres pressure from lps to continue to turn over funds especially longerdated funds and as they take that optionality to wait the pressure just build and so i think were starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward accept the valuation parameters and move forward but i just think the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 this is natural cycle and youre going to see a pickup in that activity for sure im just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly but we are going to back go back to more normalized levels ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator thank you well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi can you hear me okay oh okay sorry indiscernible david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc we can hear you fine thank you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right well thanks very much i did just want to lean in on one question regarding how youre managing the expense line as were going through this environment because weve had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit but im just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year or is this just a oneoff given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure betsy so if you look at yeartodate change in our revenues net of provision that is tracking ahead of the yeartodate change in our compensation and benefit expense we are sort of following the same protocol that we always do which is making our best estimate for what we expect to pay on a full year basis and doing that in a manner that reflects the performance of the firm as well as the overall competitive market for talent so based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation but well obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 okay and as we anticipate a continued pickup here in ma given everything you mentioned earlier i would think that thats positive operating leverage that should be coming your way would you agree with that or do i ph have something wrong there thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog and we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you operator well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions you flagged denis the record financing revenue which clearly shows momentum behind the business and it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now seems to reflect balanced growth so one i want to confirm that thats fair and could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you brennan so we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking markets we have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure setup in place we have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products the business is very diversified by subasset class and its a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis weve had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive riskadjusted returns and thats something that were going to remain mindful of but we believe given the breadth of that franchise that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing even as various rate environments should moderate brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then next question is really sort of a followon from betsys line of questioning so yeartodate youve got a efficiency ratio when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue could you help us understand how revenue growth would continue to drive improvement in that efficiency ratio denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 sure so thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that were seeing obviously our yeartodate efficiency ratio at is nearly points better on a yearoveryear basis still not at our target of but we are making progress as we continue to grow our revenues we should be able to deliver better and better efficiency but ultimately the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volumebased expenses is a contributing factor but we do have visibility for example as we continue to move out of some of our cie exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that and we do have a very granular process internally looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time while we at the same time look to drive top line revenues operator thank you well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target i mean you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth asset management you have record financing for equities and ficc combined youre number one in ma you have record management fees record assets under supervision your efficiencies gone from to you increased your dividend by to signal your confidence your cet1 ratios basis points above even the higher fed requirement so david you started off the call saying the results are solid but then you look at the returns and you say roe in the second quarter thats not quite the where you wanted to be so wheres the disconnect from what youre generating in terms of returns and where youd like to be thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah thanks mike appreciate the question look were on a journey and the way i look at it our returns for the first half of the year are i think there are a couple of things givegets in that one for sure we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which were working through and so that will come out and at some point as we work through that over the next to months well continue to make progress on that so the returns in the first half of the year would be a little higher ex that and then on top of that as weve said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information were still operating meaningfully below 10year averages in terms of investment banking activity and i think thatll come back i obviously cant predict but if you look at the returns of the firm we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm and were going to continue to focus on that now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in awm so you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking markets but weve said the awm roe is not where it needs to be you heard our comments about the fact that weve got the margin up to but the roe is still around we think we can continue to grow the business as weve said highsingle digits we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that awm roe and then you look across the firm and you have a stronger return profile so i think were making good progress we didnt say and have not audio gap work to do for sure but we feel good about the progress mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier effect when mergers really kick in can you just describe what that multiplier effect could potentially look like based on past cycles the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc what i would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is the return to average levels im not sitting here saying were going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10year averages but theres obviously if we did get back to that period and there will be some point in the future where we went above average too not just below average we have a tailwind for that but as a general matter when there are more ma transactions whether with financial sponsors or big corporates there is more financing attached to that people need to raise capital to finance those transactions they need to reposition balance sheets they need to manage risks to restructure transactions and so theres a multiplier effect as those activities increase we dont put a multiplier on it but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the ma side mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly for your returns the denominator is a big factor so how does that work with the fed i know you cant say too much and ph regional people can disagree but your whole point is that you derisked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the fed saying that maybe you havent done so so how does this process work from here will we hear results about the scb ahead or is this something thats just behind closed doors david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc look as a general matter what id say mike as a general matter were supporters of stress testing we believe its an important component of the feds mandate to really insure the safety and soundness of the banking system however weve maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness the stress test process as you just highlighted is opaque it lacks transparency it contributes to excess volatility in the stress capital buffer requirements which obviously makes prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers we dont believe that the results reflect a significant changes weve made in our business theyre not in line with our own calculations despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent yearoveryear now despite all that weve got the capital flexibility to serve our clients well continue to work with that capital flexibility and well also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down but obviously we have more work to do given this result mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to start off with a question just the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah just wanted to start with a question on the consumer platform fees they were down only modestly despite the absence of the greensky contribution just want to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues whether the quarterly run rate of million is a reasonable jumping off point as we look out to next quarter denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so steve thank you for the question i mean on a sequential basis theyre down but thats because we have the absence of the greensky contribution there actually is growth across the card portfolio i think the youve seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward the periodoverperiod growth should be more muted steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and maybe just one more clarifying question i know theres been a lot asked about the scb really just wanted to better understand denis since you noted that youre running with bps of cushion which is actually above normal just how youre handicapping the additional uncertainty related to basel iii endgame theres certainly been some favorable momentum per the press reports and even public comments from regulators but just want to better understand given the uncertainty around both the scb and basel iii endgame where youre comfortable running on a cet1 basis over the near to medium term denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks and i appreciate that question i think obviously theres been a lot of change theres been some changes in expectations and i think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range it is to signal flexibility and certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to basel iii endgame both the quantum and timing of its resolution it sounds from some of powells latest comments that that may not be something that comes into effect until perhaps into but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that i think is appropriate in light of what we know and what we dont know about the future opportunity set for goldman sachs but that buffer is designed to support clients return capital to shareholders while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks for taking my questions denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you operator well go next to devin ryan with citizens jmp devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc hi great good morning david and denis couple of questions on awm progress so the first one is on the alts business specifically and youre tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the billion mediumterm target for annual incentive fees and now with over billion in alts aum and obviously growing that would seem pretty conservative so i appreciate theres a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment just given the mix shift and the growth that youre seeing in aum there denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so devin i think its a good question and i think we share your expectation that thats going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward we laid it out as one of the building blocks at our investor day the contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective we do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were billion so you can make various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously bounce around from timetotime it is a granular vehiclebyvehicle buildup but given the current outlook and status of those funds thats our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years so i think it is an important incremental contributor and should be should help the return profile of asset wealth management on the forward couple that with the success that were having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond whats already in the unrealized disclosures devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc yeah okay thanks denis and then a followup this is also kind of connected but at a recent conference you highlighted the margin profile of all the standalone businesses in asset wealth management of public peers so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35plus for alts and some of the public firms we know are obviously well above that so i appreciate your running the awm segment as kind of one segment but if alts does accelerate and were looking at of alts aum isnt even fee earning yet what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid20 target because youre already at thus far in so just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth particularly from the alts segment as well the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thats a good question devin i mean it should be a significant unlock for us because despite the breadth and the longevity with which weve been running our alts businesses there is significant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall awm margin particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy and so in addition to just overall growth in the segment which should unlock margin improvements actually within our portfolio of activities the alts business again despite its current scale presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc great thank you operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning in terms of your onbalance sheet investment you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you obviously an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those onbalance sheet exposures also part of the equity and capital story in returns in the segment at billion for the quarter that was a decent reduction we obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance which is now at billion by the end of next year sic but our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into theres really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year sic daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood and as a followup just within asset wealth particularly on the alts side the fundraising target raised for the full year given the success youve had the private credit fund closing here in the first half was big can you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier andor maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large increasing momentum as you think about second half but also as we even into next year denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so obviously taking a step back youre talking about the targets that we set once upon a time it was billion we moved it to billion its now at billion and with billion raised through the first half and us expecting to surpass billion that means we should be north of billion by the end of this year and i think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives equity credit real estate infrastructure we had notable fundraising in private credit and real estate this quarter but you could see contributions from other strategies like equity on the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 forward and a number of different strategies both by asset class and by region so we think we have a diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform operator thank you well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape specifically in banking and markets i know its always competitive but some of the really big bank peers are leaning in who havent been a few years ago and all these regional banks that i cover are also realizing that they need broader capital market capabilities so youre obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets and just wondering how youre seeing kind of the competition impact you at this point david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure matt appreciate the question id just say investment banking and the markets business the trading business theyve always been competitive businesses i think our integrated one gs approach is a very very competitive offering i mean we can have debates but its i think one of the top two offerings out there depending on how you look at it what you look at theres always going to be competition there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in the key areas but broadly speaking we have leading ma share for years we have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time weve continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade and then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk i think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long long time and so the combination of our focus on serving our clients making sure were giving them the right resources both human capital and financial capital to accomplish what they need to accomplish the fact that we have global scale positions us very well well always be competitors but i like where our franchise sits and i dont see any reason why we shouldnt be able to continue to invest in it strengthen it and continue to have it operating as a leader in whats always been and will continue to be a very competitive business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful ph and i agree and then just separately i hate to ask you about activity levels and stuff like that since the debate three or four weeks ago but maybe ill frame it from your experience in presidential election periods like this where theres maybe just more uncertainty than normal like how do both institutional and corporate clients react do they kind of say well lets wait and see the other side is it just noise because weve been going through it for some time here but what are your thoughts on that thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc there are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity i dont have a crystal ball so i cant see what the next days leading up to our election will bring but i think were well positioned to serve our clients regardless of the environment and clients are very active at the moment and i think theyre probably going to continue to be active matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 thank you operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david good morning denis david you said in your opening comments that you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi you took the board out to silicon valley and you were impressed with the artificial intelligence and what we could expect in the future and the opportunities for goldman to be able to finance some of the infrastructure needs that may come of that can you share with us the artificial intelligence that you guys are implementing within goldman and how its making you more productive generating maybe greater revenues or even making it more efficient david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i mean at a high level gerard we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity and if you think about our business as a professional service firm and a people business where we have lots of very very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things and advance their ability to serve clients for interactive markets is a very very powerful tool so we if you look and you think across the scale of our business i think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work thats always been done on a more manual basis and a lot of the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious you can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter youre all analysts on the phone theres lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients you think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what ill call the factory of the business prepare information thoughtful information for clients their evolution there when you look at the datasets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients so that they can make better decisions around the way they position the markets thats another obvious use case for our engineering stack and we have close to engineers inside the firm the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful so those are a handful there are others we have a broad group of people that are very focused on this but again id step back while this will increase our productivity the thing that were most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business and that will create more activity and a tailwind broadly for our business as people will need to make investment will need financing will need to scale and so were excited about that broad opportunity the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup denis you talked about credit and it was impressive that you didnt have any chargeoffs in the wholesale book can you give us some color on what youre seeing there it seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didnt have any chargeoffs in the wholesale book denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks gerard as you observe chargeoff rate for us in the wholesale is approximately what we did see in this quarter was release and weve been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment so while that was a contributing benefit to sort of call it the net pcl of the quarter with consumer chargeoffs offset by that wholesale release thats not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future and although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very very diligently and consistently it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business but were pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of chargeoffs is about gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator well go next to saul martinez with hsbc saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question on just a followup on capital i mean it certainly is encouraging that your cet1 ratio rose bps in a quarter where you bought back billion of stock and you did have i think a billion reduction in rwas your presentation talks about credit rwas falling this quarter i guess can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction and i guess more importantly is there continued room for rwa optimization from here to help manage your capital levels denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks saul i appreciate that question capital optimization rwa optimization is something that weve been committed to for a very long period of time on the quarter there were reductions both in credit and market risk rwas drivers included less derivative exposure reduced equity investment exposure and in some places lower level of volatility we try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity as well as being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or falling through in our strategic plan and narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure so that is something that was contributed to quarteroverquarter benefit despite the buyback activity we executed and its something well remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thank you thats helpful and then maybe a followup on financing ficc financing up equities equity financing is now something close to of all of your equity sales and trading revenues i guess how the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2024 much more room is there or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set to continue to grow from here how much more space is there ph to use financing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thats a good question saul i think on the ficc financing side as i indicated we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that theyre seeing in their businesses and we think based on what we see currently that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess risk return opportunity set across the client portfolio so were being disciplined with respect to our growth but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the gbm business in equities the activity and the balances et cetera obviously have benefited from equity market inflation over the course of the year but its also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients and clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both ficc and equities to ensure that across all of the activities theyre doing with us that were finding some balance between helping them through financing activities helping them with intermediation helping them with human capital so both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay great thank you operator thank you at this time there are no additional questions in queue ladies and gentlemen this concludes the
