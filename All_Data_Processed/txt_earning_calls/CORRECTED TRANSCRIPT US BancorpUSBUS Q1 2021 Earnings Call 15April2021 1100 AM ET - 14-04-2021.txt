chief executive officer us bancorp thanks jen and good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today following our prepared remarks terry jodi mark and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the first quarter we reported earnings per share of credit quality trends were better than expected and the economic outlook has improved meaningfully over the past several months given the pace of the vaccine rollout and the ongoing impact of significant government stimulus based on these factors we released a little over billion of loan loss reserves this quarter revenue totaled billion in the first quarter as expected net interest income decreased compared with the fourth quarter however we expect loans to grow as the year progresses and given that securities reinvestment rates are now accretive to asset yields and our belief that premium amortization expenses likely peaked we expect that the first quarter will be a low point for net interest income improved economic activity is driving better consumer and business spending trends which in turn is translating into improving payments volume in each of our payments businesses volumes excluding covid impacted us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 travel hospitality and entertainment sectors exceeded first quarter prepandemic levels our expenses were relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter in the lower right quadrant you can see that our capital and liquidity positions remained strong and during the quarter we returned billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks slide provides key performance metrics this quarter our returns benefited from improved credit performance and reserve release longer term we believe we will continue to deliver industryleading returns on tangible common equity driven by strong ppnr performance consistent through the cycle credit performance and prudent capital management slide shows the pace of migration to the digital channel digital uptake is correlated with higher customer satisfaction easeofuse and lower cost of service which we measure very closely digital transactions now account for nearly of all transactions in the lower righthand chart you can now see that more than of loan sales now occurred digitally which compares to less than a year ago now let me turn the call over to terry who will provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends average loans declined compared with the fourth quarter as the low interest rate environment continues to impact borrower behavior elevated corporate paydown activity late in the fourth quarter negatively impacted average commercial loan growth in the first quarter recently we have seen improving pipelines and we expect inventory building and ma activity to pick up as we move further into similarly lower interest rates impacted consumer loans as increased refinancing activity impacted real estate loan balances credit card revolve rates continued to decline this quarter causing balances to contract as consumers used excess liquidity from government stimulus programs to pay down debt turning to slide average deposits increased compared with the fourth quarter reflecting the level of liquidity in the financial system as a reminder our deposits are typically seasonally lower in the first quarter of the year our overall deposit mix continues to be favorable in the first quarter our noninterestbearing deposits grew while time deposits declined slide shows our credit quality trends which continue to be better than our expectations reflecting improving economic conditions supported by additional stimulus and increased vaccine availability our net chargeoff ratio totaled in the first quarter compared with in the fourth quarter the improvement reflects lower total commercial credit card and other retail net chargeoffs the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at the end of the first quarter compared with at the end of the fourth quarter we released reserves this quarter reflective of betterthan expected credit trends and an improving economic outlook versus our previous expectations in the first quarter our loan loss provision was negative million or billion less the net chargeoffs of million our allowance for credit losses as of march totaled billion or of loans the allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth lower unemployment and changing credit quality within the portfolios driven in part by the benefits of continued government stimulus programs us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 slide highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category turning to slide exposures to certain atrisk segments given the current environment are stable compared with the fourth quarter the left table shows that customer balances included in payment relief programs continued to decline meaningfully in the first quarter to less than of total loans slide provides an earnings summary in the first quarter of we earned per diluted share these results include a reserve release of billion turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion declined compared with the fourth quarter due to fewer days in the quarter lower average loan balances and a basis point decline in net interest margin the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily driven by higher premium amortization expense lower portfolio reinvestment rates and mortgage loan prepayments as mentioned earlier we expect loans to grow as the year progresses also given that securities reinvestment rates are now accretive to asset yields and our belief that premium amortization has likely peaked we expect the first quarter will be the low point for net interest income slide highlights trends in noninterest income which as a reminder is typically seasonally lower in the first quarter of each year noninterest income declined from a year ago primarily driven by lower mortgage revenue on a yearoveryear basis strong refinancing activity drove higher production volumes and related production revenue however in the first quarter we recorded a reduction of million to the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights net of hedges which compares with a favorable increase in the valuation net of hedges of million a year ago with prepayments speeds declining we would expect future changes in the msr fair value adjustment to be more moderate business activity and strong underlying market conditions drove growth in trust and investment management fees treasury management revenue and commercial product revenue although deposit service charges were negatively impacted by lower consumer spend and increased consumer liquidity from government stimulus slide provides information on our payment services business including a breakdown of segment volume for the first quarter of compared with more normalized levels slide indicates that sales volumes across our payments businesses have continued to rebound since bottoming in april of in the first quarter total payments fee revenue was essentially flat compared with the first quarter of credit and debit card revenue increased on a yearoveryear basis driven by higher interchange revenue and higher prepaid card fees as a result of government stimulus programs merchant services revenue decreased compared with a year ago which was better than what we had expected coming into the quarter improving sales growth in north america was more than offset by expected declines in european sales due to covidrelated shutdowns corporate payments revenue declined year overyear as travel and entertainment revenue continued to lag turning to slide noninterest expenses were relatively stable on a linkedquarter basis as expected yearover year growth of was driven by increased mortgage and capital markets production incentive costs and expenses related to business investments in digital and technology which was partly offset by a decline in costs related to covid19 and a future delivery liability incurred in the first quarter of us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at march was compared with our target cet1 ratio of given improving economic conditions in the first quarter we bought back million of common stock as part of our previously announced billion repurchase program ill now provide some forwardlooking guidance for the second quarter of we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to increase in the low singledigits compared with the first quarter and we look for modest loan growth we expect payments fee revenue to continue to improve sequentially as economic activity continues to accelerate starting in the second quarter growth rates will be meaningfully impacted by favorable yearoveryear comps given the covid environment we expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared with the first quarter the outlook for credit quality has improved in the past two quarters along with the improving economic environment however we think that the net chargeoff ratios likely to remain low as the first quarter level of as we move further into the year we expect the net chargeoff ratio to normalize toward prepandemic levels we will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as conditions change for the full year we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry one year ago we were at the beginning stages of a pandemicdriven economic downturn which had no precedent we were confident in the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to support our customers employees and communities through a difficult time but we along with the entire industry faced an uncertain outlook a lot has changed in a year our first quarter results were reflective of the lingering impact of an economy that continues to heal but has not fully recovered to prepandemic activity levels however we are optimistic about the trajectory from here we believe we are well positioned to benefit from what many expect to be the strongest economic growth this country has seen in decades as we capture the potential of increased consumer and business spending across all of our business lines most directly related to our three payments businesses importantly we expect our multiyear investments in digital and payments to continue to pay off well beyond any cyclical benefit that we see in the upcoming quarters these investments aimed at enhancing the customer experience and leveraging the power of our payments ecosystem will position us at the forefront in banking and drive market share gains for many years to come ultimately our goal is to deliver industryleading returns through this cycle and as such we invest to drive top line revenue growth while prudently managing expenses credit quality and capital with the best interest of our longterm shareholders in mind in closing id like to thank our employees for all their hard work and their commitment to serving our customers with the expertise and integrity they have come to expect from us well now open up the call to qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of david rochester with compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning david david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on just on fee income you guys mentioned payment activities should continue to recover in i was just hoping you could frame that potentially in a range and then as you look out to a more normalized back half of the year versus where we are today what kind of yearoveryear growth in transaction volumes do you think we can see at that point i just heard some ph other peers in the space talk about some pretty robust yearoveryear growth as we move into the back half of the year i was just curious what you guys are expecting terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i mean its a great question so when we end up obviously the comparables on a yearoveryear basis kind of going forward is going to be pretty strong simply because of what was happening in as we kind of look at different components of our revenue lets take merchant acquiring as an example in the first quarter we saw overall it was down about but as andy said the nonairline nonimpacted sort of industries was actually up about and the airlines continue to be depressed at kind of in that to level but we do expect all those different things all those different categories continue to improve our expectation when we end up looking at the payments revenues kind of overall across the categories that by the time we get to by the end of the fourth quarter or certainly very early in the sort of timeframe that we will be back to prepandemic levels on a total basis in terms of total merchant acquiring total creditdebit card as well as the cps businesses david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thats great color appreciate that maybe just switching to nim real quick you mentioned new securities yields are accretive to the book yield and prepays are declining so that should bring down securities ph premium am expense i know you mentioned nii was moving higher from here are you also saying you think youll get some margin expansion here as well us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well heres the way i would kind of frame it first of all nim is kind of an output with respect to how your balance sheet is changing and of course theres a lot of different dynamics that are occurring within the loan portfolio today our expectation from a nim perspective is that in the second quarter its probably reasonably flat but expanding from there and the dynamics are going to be really around loan growth balances which will probably continue to be a little bit of a pressure but offset by expanding and improving investment portfolio and thats a driver of premium amortization its the driver of the fact that the differential from a reinvestment rate is getting much stronger because of the steepening yield curve and other factors david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great so flattish in expanding in the back half of the year potentially terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah yeah david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great all right thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning gents terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey john andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yeah so on the loan demand side i know you acknowledge that you do expect loans to be pressured near term i guess can you just talk about when do you see a more notable inflection in loan growth and what do you see as the drivers and i guess also within the commercial side can you just talk about the demand that youre seeing in terms of pipeline and utilization thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 yeah yeah john great question so what we are seeing in terms of loan so lets just talk about loan growth as weve said that in the second quarter we do expect this to start to expand but its going to be modest i mean theres still for example pressure that will exist in certain categories on the commercial side what we are seeing is that pipelines are getting stronger really across most areas and most geography in addition when we think about the stimulus thats been put into the system theres going to be a lot of consumer spend especially as the second half of the year develops and i think that businesses what we are starting to see is the businesses are becoming much more optimistic theyre thinking about inventory build and theyre thinking about the capital expenditure and i think that those are all really good signs and the second thing i would just say probably more so for the second half of the year is that we do see and believe that ma activity is going to start to strengthen and that will have positive implications with respect to ci loans which is all good we have if you end up looking at some of the other categories the significant amount of stimulus on the consumer side has allowed consumers to be paying down debt which is i think one of the things that the industry has been seeing revolve rates have come down and that necessarily ends up impacting balances but just as a reminder we do typically see an increase in credit cards in the second quarter and so those factors will offset each other a bit our auto lending has been very strong and i would expect that that will continue to be strong so its a bit of a puts and takes in the near term but we do i think the encouraging thing is we are seeing a lot of nice green shoots and as consumer spends starts to expand and grow i think that the consumer lending will come back as well john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks terry and then andy i wonder if you could talk a little bit about ma interest both on the whole bank side and nonbank i know a lot of attention out there regarding potential deals and certainly a big discussion around the scale the need for scale by within the bank space given the competitive backdrop so i just want to see if you can give us your updated thoughts on that front both on the whole bank side obviously but also nonbank thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah thanks john and i think our view is consistent with what weve talked about in past calls which were open to looking at opportunities would meaningfully move the needle from a traditional bank standpoint in terms of either acquiring customers or new geographies and then in the nonbank space we are active in this with as you saw on our payments business looking to expand our capabilities and our distribution and those are areas that we continue to focus on particularly as we think about this payments ecosystem and adding either partnerships or capabilities through ma john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 you bet operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey a couple of questions one just wanted to dig in a little bit on payments and what you think you can do there on the corporate side especially as youre one of the first to offer the rtp and i hear from different institutions like clients are not that excited about rtp on the corporate side but im thinking you might have a different point of view so i wanted to drill into that a little bit and see if theres a needle mover thats coming over the next few years or not andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah betsy this is andy i think theres a pretty significant opportunity here first of all there are a number of use cases that were currently working with a number of customers across many different industries but i do think that everything from the way request for pay daily payroll the way youre managing receivables and payables the information that comes with it ph on an auto reconciliation there is a lot of opportunity now the challenge is theres a lot of time zero investment required to get to that opportunity and thats why were working with our customers because we want them to understand the opportunity and we want to work with them on that investment and the change in their processes to gain that opportunity but i do believe that theres a pretty significant change coming and the payments mechanisms that we have used for years and years particularly in businesstobusiness ph in clearing of checks and ach and wires are all going to migrate fairly rapidly over the next few years betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then your monetization of that is through increasing deposits or is there a hard dollar fees associated us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think it will be a combination of both not unlike how our payments business works today part of it is from the balance sheet and part of its from fees and part of it might be just having a fee structure to allow you to do the things that rtp will allow as opposed to perhaps a per transaction fee betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then followup question just on credit i know you spoke about normalizing towards prepandemic levels over time does that mean around a bps nco rate or is that something lower because during pre pandemic we also had certain asset classes that were net positive on the ncos indiscernible meaning net negative right like you had recoveries in some of the asset classes so just trying to understand when you say prepandemic what kind of number youre talking about andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp ill give you the high level answer then mark runkels here with us hell add in but yes is the short answer to your question if you think about prepandemic we were in that to basis point range as terry said is probably lower than what is normal over a longer period of time and i would expect it to migrate back to that level mark what would you add mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah thats exactly spot on theres not much more to add were just thinking over time well get back to a more normalized level and well see some of those recoveries that youre seeing potentially come down and well see the portfolio start to normalize back closer to that basis point range betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and just given your experience and how many cycles youve been through what should we be thinking about as a timeframe for that is that next months or thats more like next months or some other timeframe andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp first of all any time ive tried to predict time frames in this environment its been challenging so i dont claim to know any more than anybody else but as we see the great improvement we have today i think things start to get back to that normal level in the latter half of this year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking the question terry maybe just a little more nuance on the margin are you able to quantify how beneficial an impact the decline in premium amortization could be for the margin and nii going forward in other words so where is it now where would you to normalize out to and then just any thoughts on contribution to the margin from ppp in the second quarter so i think given the window closure from the sba in the first quarter maybe a little lumpier than we might have figured previously terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah let me take the second question first from a ppp standpoint first quarter versus second quarter we dont see that as being a big driver for us just based upon the size of our book of business and that sort of thing that we ended up originating from a premium amortization perspective what we have seen kind of on the way up is that on a quarterover quarter basis kind of in that anywhere from to basis points sort of range to basis points sort of range and a big part of it scott will depend upon how quickly prepayment speeds do start to come down so its a little bit hard to kind of put an exact impact in terms of what we will have in the second quarter but our expectation is that the prepayment speeds continue to linger a little higher in april but then start to come meaningfully down in may and june r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thats great thank you and then maybe if i could return to the payments business for a second as well once we get sort of back to normalization it seems pretty clear theres a large opportunity here both in the us and europe as things kind of normalize once we get back to that steady state maybe just a thought or two on where the growth rate of those businesses in the aggregate kind of flushes out how does it compare to sort of the rest of the just the traditional bank part of usb maybe any thoughts on sort of longerterm trajectory there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 yeah scott ill take that one this is andy again i think as you said we have the shortterm cyclical positive thats going to occur as spending activities both for businesses and consumers get back to normal as well as corporate i think our longerterm opportunity is in that ecosystem we talked about so we have over million business banking customers that we define as million in revenue and above and we believe we can grow these relationships just overall relationships in the neighborhood of to over the next few years and in addition we believe we can grow the overall revenue levels to because of expanding the share of wallet because the fact is less than of our merchant customers have a business banking product and an even lower number of our business banking customers have a merchant product so theres a lot of opportunity there and i think the upside is pretty significant and its sort of like what i talked about with the rtp its just not about card solutions but its about managing their payrolls their cash flows their payables and receivables leveraging data helping them run their business and thats just in the business banking category i think theres additional opportunity in commercial and corporate as well so that will be our focus and i think that will be one of the drivers of growth going forward terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp the other thing that i might add is that weve been making fairly significant investment in ecommerce and tech led sort of capabilities within our merchant acquiring space and that is a segment that over the course of the last months have been growing kind of in that to range and as that becomes a bigger and bigger part of our business i think that that continues to help our merchant acquiring space r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thats perfect thank you guys very much i appreciate it andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey ken us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc question first just on the fee side i was just wondering if you can talk us through some more detail on your outlook for the mortgage business understanding it had a million msr adjustment this quarter but you guys have been share takers on the production side but obviously you mentioned the gain on sale coming down where do you think the mortgage business can go from here and some of those puts and takes thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah great question so when we think about the mortgage business we continue to think that on the origination side that we have been capturing market share we think that theres still opportunity to do that and heres the reason why over the course of the last several years weve been making a significant investment weve talked about the fact that weve been focused on the retail side of the equation purchase mortgage and home mortgages that originate from the home sale side of the equation so even as refinancings come down we do have the capability and the capacity to be able to continue to ramp up on the home sale side of the equation or the purchase mortgage side of the equation so i think that that is an opportunity i think that our technology continues to outpace the competition and digital capabilities enable us to be able to capture that market share so thats all good youre right that there will be impacts with respect to refinancing starting to slow as rates move up and thats something that we would expect and the gain on sale will start to decline as capacity in the system has gotten stronger but i think that the implications of the investments that we have made have been positive and will continue to be positive so while mortgage revenue is likely to come down during the year it is still going to be a good part of our business did that help ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah i was just wondering do you mean come down on a year on a full year basis which is kind of obvious based on where we started or do you mean that it could still settle lower from where we just got to the million terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp no its the latter im sorry the million keep in mind in the million is about million msr valuation adjustment so when you back that out or when you take exclude that we still saw some pretty significant production and origination revenue in the first quarter and while it will settle down a little bit from there we still think its pretty strong through the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 and terry that msr valuation was more of a temporary phenomenon and we wouldnt expect that to continue at that level going forward terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thats right thats right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right so it was more of a okay just to check you again it was more of a obviously its going to be a tough comp on a full year full year basis but this might not have been the top tick for mortgage banking revenues going forward terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp absolutely thats absolutely correct ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it second question just on costs you mentioned flattish yearoveryear the first quarter had a really high comp number even with the seasonal benefit in it and so i just want to make sure that that as usual comes off and how much of that seasonal adjustment is in there and then i know you said the covid cost came down but how much of a burden is that still in the cost number as well thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well with respect to covid we had more costs last year we continue to have those costs and while its come down some that hasnt been an impactful change relative to for example a year ago we still have all the cleaning costs and things like that that we need to do and i think thats going to continue until people get comfortable being back in the office et cetera when you end up looking at compensation costs again part of it is seasonal part of it is also when you end up looking at our performancebased incentives every year we have to reset that to be fully funded and last year just given the performance and the payouts being significantly lower there is the impact of kind of refunding that on an annual basis so andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and terry the third part is a stockbased comp ph for retirees are always is higher in the first quarter just because of the thats the seasonal matter that you talked about is higher because of the way we account for it all at time zero terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah and that will come down in the second quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i want to followup first on kens question just on expenses yeah so the outlook for flat in is good but can you give us some comments kind of looking to the back half this year and beyond because it does feel like the costs are still bloated and as we think about revenue accelerating from some of the things that you talked about maybe you can give us a sense of what you think you can do on the expense side and the operating leverage terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well matt as weve said our goal is always to manage the expenses as best we can and keep them flat especially in a kind of a challenging revenue environment which were still in certainly as we get into a more normal revenue environment we do expect that we would be able to achieve ph positive operation but the timing of that is still difficult to kind of get your head around and then we have to see things like either rising or steepening yield curve kind of a normalization of the payments space and just settling out of where mortgage ends up being so a little bit hard to end up predicting kind of the timing associated with that we do have a very strong focus with respect to expenses though as we think about the rest of the year and going into matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then maybe asking a little bit of a different way and segue into like some broader business metrics you laid out financial targets at the investor day it goes back in obviously the worlds changed those feel kind of stale what would be some updated targets if you look out two to three years and im thinking the efficiency ratio which has gotten quite high and then any kind of roe metrics that youd like to update as well would be helpful thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt this is andy i think we talked about a to tangible return on common and im going to focus on that ratio while it was higher in this quarter that was all because of the credit reserve release and we know thats not a repeatable item and as i think about this year its going to be below that to your point but we still feel comfortable that in a more normal environment where the economy continues to strengthen the rates continue to normalize and we get back to the normal spend levels so all the things we talked about on this call we still believe we can get to that to and that number is what we think we get to when we get to that normal environment which likely will be later this year more likely as we get into us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 from an efficiency ratio standpoint same point and building on what terry talked about its higher than normal right now but the higher is principally because of new the dominator which is revenue and again as we get to more normal levels our expectation and our focus is to continue to get to the low matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so from the this quarter to im sorry you said the low or the mid i thought have been the target once before andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp the longterm target is the low matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right so that would obviously imply outsized operating leverage again look the revenue needs to be there i think everybody gets that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah yeah matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc but i think theres concern that if revenue grows and its being driven by rates and loans you cant have ph expense growth against that to meet the efficiency targets obviously if its driven by mortgage and things like that that have a lot of comp i think people understand the higher expense growth but you would need mathematically a few years of outsized operating leverage andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah and if you think about where the revenue opportunities are theyre less directly comp related so for example margin and payments have a different compensation structure than for example mortgage to your point and matt just to tell you were managing expenses very closely we meet with all our business lines on a regular basis and were always balancing the investments were making to get that digital acquisition the customers the growth that weve talked about against managing the shortterm expenses and looking for efficiencies and operations and the way were doing business on a daytoday basis so thats an area of focus i can assure you for both terry and myself as well as the entire management committee matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay that was helpful thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hi erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch my followup question is actually a piggyback off of matts question this is sort of the second straight quarter where results are fine but the stock has responded less favorably and andy im wondering in the discussion of a normalized rotce between to we hear you loud and clear through this call and other calls that you have made investments throughout the years and you did hit in i guess the investor base is really the feedback im betting is well whats the upside from here and im wondering clearly rates have to normalize and to matts point operating leverage will be wider when we actually get short rates going but can the initiatives get you to at least the top end of the range again imagine in a world where you have some normalization in the short end but also were past the point of reserve releases in other words have the investments potentially reset your normalized rotce higher or is sort of the top end of what you see andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so erika let me take your question and maybe two parts from a revenue standpoint i do think for sure was a low point for all the reasons youre well aware of and particularly the payments business which had significant headwinds and those headwinds now have become tailwinds and i think the same is set could be set for the margin component which i think all the reasons terry talked about net interest income i think goes up from the points we are today and at some point particularly in the second half of the year i think loan growth starts to come back so i think the revenue has positive bias across all categories if you go back to a couple of things number one is we were investing in digital capabilities and we had an increased stepup in that investment that i think is more leveled off right now so youre not going to see that same increase that you saw the last few years the second thing is we also have the opportunity from some of the branch closures that weve achieved a over the last couple of years some of which will has been and will be reinvested some of which will come through the bottom line us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 and then as i talked about with matt were looking for efficiencies from our tech stack from the way were doing business and our operational component and those investments in digital not only allow us to gain customer acquisition but it also allows us to more efficiently run the business and from an operating cost standpoint its favorable so all those things add up to why i answer the questions i do erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and just a followup there your efficiency ratio in when you achieved rotce was almost and so i guess the question here is are we being too optimistic by then concluding that if you do dial back down to the low that your natural rotce in a more normalized rate environment could be above andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i think our return on tangible is that to is the way we think about it and the modeling that we have and the projections that we have would get us to that level erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolf research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning andy and terry can you discuss how you think about pentup demand dynamics and how they may differ across your consumer and commercial businesses where do you think theres more gearing to the reopening is it either is it consumer side commercial side are they pretty similar and if you could work into your response how you think the excess liquidity on hand impacts both sides in terms of loan growth outlook that would be great terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah let me kind of take it first and then andy can add on but when we end up looking at the consumer versus commercial i think that the stimulus thats been put into the system well see that on the consumer side pretty quickly in other words consumer spend we do expect to continue to ramp up from here and really probably through at least the end of the year and you see that in the gdp growth predictions or projections that are out there really being driven by that i do think that thats going to help us on the fee side of the equation and it will also as the year progresses help us in terms of consumer loans which i talked about earlier us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 on the commercial side i think that again there are things that the customers will need to do in order to be able to meet that consumer demand if you will and that is in the form of continuing to build their inventories and make some capital investments which they just like many of us have been holding off so the timing of that though is probably a little bit more subdued earlier simply because of the fact that there is a as you said a fair amount of liquidity and deposit balances that exist and so they need to burn through that similar to what we saw the last cycle that we kind of went through so what were first going to see is that utilizing those deposit balances and then starting to see more robust sort of loan growth thats why we think its really probably more a second half of the year before that starts to happen andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and i wouldnt add much terry i think the last category to come back is going to be corporate te that category is still down versus levels we all are experiencing what were experiencing with not traveling right now and i think thats going to be the last category to come back bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats very helpful on your excess liquidity commentary i wanted to ask if your mix of investment securities relative to average earning assets grew to just over this quarter which i believe is the highest that weve seen relative to your history and it sounds like you guys expect to grow that from here if i heard you correctly can you discuss how youre weighing the incremental nii opportunity there from growing that securities book with the oci risk and just from an overall asset liability management perspective terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i guess when we think about it at least in the near term and one of the things were going to end up having to do is to kind of weigh the opportunity that the yield curve continues to steepen even further from here and so well kind of pick our points with respect to where we make those investments but i think in the near term until loan growth and that demand really starts to solidify i think that the ability to deploy lowcost deposits that we see as part of inflows into the investment portfolio makes sense and youre right it is kind of a balancing act that you end up having to kind of take a look at and just based upon our expectation that the longer end of the curve continues to move up the shorter end of the curve probably lags out a bit that to us makes some sense bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it if i could squeeze in one last one for andy andy can you discuss how active you are in your discussions with regulators regarding the uneven playing field with many of the fintech players particularly those who are benefiting from things like unregulated debit interchange which obviously originally introduced as a small bank exemption under durbin not for them but is there any expectation for a little bit more of a leveling of the playing field or is this the competitive landscape that were is just sort of the new reality andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 i think our focus on that from a banking perspective is on the safety and soundness from a customers perspective you think about data protection liquidity ensuring that the deposits are there all those things which makes banks a very safe industry we want to make sure that those same that same level of oversight is there for our customers and for customers using some of those other capabilities and thats a real area of focus bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you for taking my questions andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi okay i have one i guess kind of negative question and one positive question so we can start with the negative one first i guess youve heard but look theres six years of negative operating leverage at us bancorp and theres stories around it right you had the regulatory situation and you have the pandemic you dont have youre undersized in capital markets which have been a record versus some of your larger peers and youre overindexed in payments which has been hurt so i mean theres certainly reasons here but if you look at the cost linkedquarter or yearoveryear theyre higher you look at the revenues linkedquarter yearoveryear theyre lower so i know youve given some guidance but just to be crystal clear are you saying that ppnr is at a low point in the first quarter and should improve from here terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp well yeah i mean when you again when you end up thinking about the dynamics weve been talking about i do think that the rate environment and what were going to see in terms of net interest income is going to be positive going forward i think that that is a tailwind i think the tailwind that exists with respect to the payments will also help us as we start to look into especially the latter half of and into so i think theres a number of things that create tailwinds from a revenue standpoint that actually do help us quite a bit from a ppnr standpoint mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and you also said flat expenses at least in the second quarter so i guess one question is with all the branch closures that you had why we havent seen more or less negative operating leverage i just suspect youre us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 investing more in your digital infrastructure can you share any of those numbers like how much youre investing i know you havent disclosed that yet but more generally what are you trying to build and when do you think you can get there its kind of like the payment ecosystem connecting your payments customers with your commercial customers whats the total addressable market can you become like a squarelike competitor just a little more elaboration on where youre spending and what the end game is terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah mike and to answer your negative question on a with a short answer the answer is yes on positive ppnr from the first quarter levels for the rest of the year in terms of where were investing its what i talked about the just in the business banking side for our business we have about million customers and we believe theres as i talked about to growth in customer opportunity to growth in revenue opportunity and thats just in the business banking segment not including commercial and corporate so i think thats where a lot of opportunity exists where weve been investing is exactly in that ecosystem and the ability to acquire customers in a digital fashion ease of customer use from a customer experience standpoint reflecting the fact that theyre not utilizing the branches so were closing the branches as you talked about reflecting transactions that are taking place there theyre taking place in the digital way investing on the digital site so that everything you said is correct and thats the way were thinking about it as well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning and thanks for taking my questions actually just one left on my list here the acl ratio down for every loan class except cre up on a percentage basis im just wondering is that something to do with the covidimpacted industries or anything else within that billion billion portfolio mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah this is mark ill just add to that thats an area that we continue to be very focused in on either you hit it right theres some of those covidimpacted industries but i think theres longer systemic ships if you will potentially with office and some of the multifamily that were continuing to be very focused on and then that could play out a little bit longer as could play out a little bit longer as we work our way through the cycle us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc andy terry thanks for taking my questions but more importantly i applaud you for changing the time on your call thank you for listening its not always that we see that a couple of questions firstly you continue to see good growth in commercial products pardon me if i even though you did move it theres still been lots of calls today so if i missed that sorry if im making i repeat it what drove that growth and what do you see as the drivers there what do you see as the outlook for that ill start with that terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so on the commercial products side and maybe a couple of couple of dynamics part of it is yearover year first quarter was fairly volatile a year ago and had some implications on a yearoveryear basis theres some growth that is occurring when we think about the future quarters for the rest of i think one of the dynamics that will help that is that what we are seeing right now is with rising rates there are a lot of companies when theyre thinking about their debt capital structure pulling forward out of probably into some of their refinancing activities and then if you remember from last year there was a lot of activity in terms of capital markets companies really trying to rebuild or build as much liquidity as they could and a year later just given the environment and the economic outlook they have the opportunity to refinance that even after just a year and so theyre taking advantage of that so its kind of those activities related to churn pulling some things forward et cetera that are going to help commercial products revenue kind of hold up through the year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay and then a different question for you folks i noticed that branches were down a little over or so andy you had mentioned last quarter that you want to shrink you expect to shrink branches in the doubledigit range is that still part of the plan and if so how much and is that whats the timing on that as you look out andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure vivek so if you look at a couple of years ago we were just over branches and now were closer to so were down about i wouldnt expect additional major changes in the number of branches youll have some puts and takes in fact youll see some additions in certain markets and some subtractions or branch consolidation where appropriate but i wouldnt expect a significant change from current levels vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey gerard how are you doing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc how are you terry terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp doing well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc andy can you touch on and i apologize if you addressed this but i know you guys have talked about the low level of net chargeoffs this quarter is not likely sustainable and i think you said in one of the answers to a question earlier that it could start to creep up by the second half of this year to the more normalized pre pandemic levels that you have identified can you share with us what would cause it not to go up what will you guys have to see that if this would continue at basis points to basis points through the remainder of the year andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah im going to start and then mark can add in gerard so some of the things were seeing right now individuals have a lot of cash either because of the stimulus checks that have occurred or not spending money in other things so our payment rates in credit card terry talked about that thats impacting balances all those things drive to near record levels of low chargeoffs in our credit card portfolio and our delinquencies and the consumer is just very liquid right now and thats part of the reason that were such at a low such a low level and we do expect that to continue to normalize over time as they start to utilize those savings and get back to spending money in a more traditional sense so thats one of the things that we would expect if theres a delay on that then were probably going to be at a low level for a longer timeframe and then the area that we would expect to start to migrate up a little bit as well is on the areas impacted by the pandemic that mark talked about and ill let mark answer mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 yeah the other area that i might focus in on is weve seen strong asset value so if you look at autos has been strong weve seen a increase in auto value for example gerard in february alone as well as the residential real estate continues to be strong so i think if those trends continue to strengthen we could continue to be at these lower levels but i think our view would be those start to normalize and to andys point the liquidity starts to come down we see spending activity picking back up which would lead you to kind of more normalized levels as we move through the back half of the year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup andy over the past earnings calls youve often commented about outlooks for mergers and acquisitions and i dont think you were asked that question today but what is your outlook for depository type of acquisitions i know banks are sold theyre not bought but just to give an update on what you guys are thinking about expanding possibly through that strategy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure gerard and that did come up a little earlier but our focus continues to be from a traditional bank standpoint is something that would be meaningful from a customer acquisition or a geographic sense i do think the value and the importance of scale is even more important than it was months ago or months ago so thats something were very focused on and then the other areas that were focused on are what i would call partnerships or ma related to capabilities on the payments side building our ecosystem building the distribution and those are smaller deals technologyrelated deals that weve done already in the payments business and well continue to focus on gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and i apologize i think you are answering it the second time thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thats okay no problem operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to ms jen thompson jennifer ann thompson executive vice president directorinvestor relations economic analysis us bancorp thank
