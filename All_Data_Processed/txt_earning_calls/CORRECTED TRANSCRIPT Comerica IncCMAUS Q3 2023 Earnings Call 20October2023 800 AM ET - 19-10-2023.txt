curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well thank you and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call today we reported third quarter net income of million or per share moderation per share exceeding expectations indiscernible optimization and moderation in customer demand drove a decline in average loans to billion successful execution of our targeted deposit strategy grew customer balances enabling us to repay billion in maturing fhlb advances our continued focus on fee income produced another robust quarter and credit quality remained very strong with modest net chargeoffs following three consecutive quarters of net recoveries complementing our compelling financial results we advanced other strategic initiatives small business remains a priority and im excited to announce that we exceeded our billion lending goal ahead of our threeyear commitment with our investments in talent products and services for this important sector we believe small business will become a growth engine over time achievement such as publishing our first finance submissions report making community development investments and recognition for our volunteer program further underscore the value we place on supporting the communities we serve advancing our ameriprise partnership and selective talent acquisition within wealth comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 management positioned us to achieve our noninterest income objectives while deepening customer relationships we continue modernizing our approach to technology to better enable agile product enhancements as we leverage offpremise platforms to run over three quarters of our business applications progress towards these initiatives allow us to balance the strength of our legacy for the future vision to sustainably support our customers as a trusted banking partner moving to a summary of our results on slide average loans declined billion with the largest reduction resulting from our strategic exit of mortgage banker finance success winning new deposits and bringing back customer balances drove an increase in average deposits of billion net interest income exceeded expectations for the quarter even with the impact of competitive deposit pricing and loan trends credit quality remained very strong despite continued expected migration outperformers to noninterest income partially offset higher than expected expense pressures finally profitability and loan selectivity further enhanced our capital position as we generated an estimated cet1 ratio of above our target despite the disruptive industry events earlier this year we effectively managed our balance sheet to create abundant liquidity enhance returns over time while taking care of our customers and exceeding profitability expectations now ill turn the call over to jim wholl walk through the quarter in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide our strategic actions and shift optimization caused average loans and commitments to decline the exit of mortgage banker finance is progressing as expected and contributed to almost half of the reduction in average balances we still expect the exit to be substantially complete by yearend declines in equity fund services were largely concentrated in nonrelationship customers but we remain committed to this important business lower utilization within general middle market reduced balances reflecting softening loan demand in this elevated rate environment ongoing funding of multifamily and industrial construction projects continue to drive higher commercial real estate utilization but we saw inflection and commitment growth as we strategically managed pipeline and origination volume the floating nature of our commercial loan portfolio benefited from rising rates as loan yields continued to climb to in the third quarter slide demonstrates our successful deposit generation average deposit balances increased exceeding expectations and ha trends as we added new deposits and won back customer balances that diversified earlier in the year in fact corporate banking in middle market california both closed the quarter in line with their early march balances after experiencing more concentrated diversification in q1 as expected noninterestbearing deposits trended down at a decelerating rate with the lowest balance decline in the last four quarters considering that modest reduction our deposit mix was more impacted by growth in the denominator with success in winning interestbearing deposits we continue to view our deposit mix as a competitive advantage providing a more stable and costeffective funding source than our peers industry efforts to enhance liquidity drove competition and when combined with the higher rate environment deposit costs increased to basis points resulting in a cumulative beta of comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 in recent weeks deposit betas have been moderating and we intend to remain nimble in our relationship pricing approach so we are able to balance customer needs with profitability targets while closely monitoring the market with an even lower percentage of uninsured deposits the operating nature of our accounts and an enviable customer base we believe our strong deposit profile is now even more attractive as shown on slide our effective liquidity strategy and strong deposit growth allowed us to absorb all of our contractual wholesale funding maturities this quarter we expect to continue to utilize excess cash to further reduce wholesale funding in the coming quarters our loan to deposit ratio continued to trend favorably closing at for the quarter with significant liquidity capacity and very light remaining unsecured funding maturities we have flexibility to manage funding needs and are better positioned to prioritize high return growth in periodend balances in our securities portfolio on slide declined billion with paydowns maturities and a million negative marktomarket adjustment although we have nominal treasury maturities remaining in larger scheduled maturities and anticipated securities repayments over the next two years are projected to benefit net interest income and aoci altogether we project a improvement in unrealized securities losses over the next two years this estimated burn off is sensitive to the dynamic rate environment and length in the quarter end however since our portfolio is pledged to enhance our liquidity position we do not anticipate any need to sell securities and therefore unrealized losses should not impact income overall our securities strategy remains unchanged as we stopped reinvesting over a year ago and we maintain our entire portfolio as available for sale providing full transparency and management flexibility we will continue to closely monitor final regulatory rules to consider the impact on our securities strategy as we consider the need for future compliance turning to slide net interest income decreased million to million but outperformed expectations we were encouraged by the lower pace of decline in net interest income as we move closer to what we believe may soon be an inflection point competitive deposit pricing and lower loan balances offset the benefits of loan yields and reduced wholesale funding balances with the strategic management of our interest rate sensitivity rates have nominally impacted income and we remained effectively asset neutral as shown on slide successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the current composition of our balance sheet favorably positioned us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual basis points or basis points on average decline in interest rates by strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios while considering balance sheet dynamics we intend to maintain our insulated position over time credit quality remains very strong as highlighted on slide following three consecutive quarters of net recoveries we observed modest net chargeoffs of million as expected credit migration continued with the greater concentration in businesses with more relative exposure to elevated rates and inflationary pressures including commercial real estate leveraged loans and technology and life sciences while the economic forecast improved slightly from the prior quarter the outlook remains uncertain which when coupled with lower loan balances which impacted loan mix contributed to an increase in our allowance for credit losses to of total loans notably nonaccrual loans declined for the sixth consecutive quarter and inflows to nonaccruals of million also declined consistent with our proven credit discipline we continue to closely monitor our portfolio and expect further migration to remain manageable on slide noninterest income of million was our third highest quarter on record following our second highest quarter in deferred compensation which was fully offset in expenses reduced million contributing comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 to most of the noninterest income decline softer derivative activity more than offset increased loan syndication fees pressuring capital markets revenue fiduciary income was negatively impacted by annual fees received in the prior quarter movement in the rate curve benefited risk management hedge income but will vary in the future based on the rate environment and the position of our hedging portfolio growth in noninterest income continues to enhance our overall revenue profile and capital efficiency over time expenses on slide increased million salaries and benefits were up million and million that increases in temporary labor due to staff augmentation advancing technology and wealth management initiatives outside processing increased million driven by certain vendor terms that are sensitive to interest rates and our trust platform conversion other expenses benefited from large modernization credits from the sale of real estate offset by increased litigation and regulatory related expenses consulting fees and operational losses we believe we and the industry are in a period of calibration as we balance the profitability and risk management impacts from the first quarter disruption with strategic investments critical for future growth we remain committed to managing an efficient organization and are assessing opportunities to offset some of these pressures so that we may continue to deliver strong returns over time slide highlights our solid capital position capital generation from profitability and lower loan balances drove our cet1 ratio further above our target to an estimated our third quarter tangible common equity ratio of includes a negative basis point impact from aoci higher rates increased unrealized losses in our securities and swap portfolios driving a more negative impact in prior quarter based on the september forward curve we anticipate approximately a reduction in our unrealized losses by the end of although the proposed capital changes do not apply to us based on our asset size we favor a conservative approach to capital management and feel it is prudent to remain mindful of the regulations as they evolve our outlook for is on slide and assumes no significant change in the economic environment we project full year average loan growth of which would be our highest annual loan growth rate in a decade the strategic exit of mortgage banker finance and increased selectivity is expected to continue to impact fourth quarter balances our projected full year average deposit decline at improved over prior expectations with the success in winning new deposits and bringing back customer balances with the exception of the impact from our mortgage banker finance exit and utilizing excess cash to modestly reduce the maturing broker deposits we expect deposits to remain relatively flat in the fourth quarter our outlook does not assume a significant benefit from seasonality but if we did see a return to more normal fourth quarter seasonal patterns that may provide more upside than projected we still expect another record year of net interest income in growing to over last years record results competitive deposit pricing continued deposit mix change and a modest decline in loans are expected to drive a to reduction in fourth quarter net interest income although shortterm rates are expected to remain high through yearend our asset sensitivity position is designed to protect our profitability by minimizing the negative impact of rates when they decline comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 credit quality remained very strong and we expect continued migration to be manageable we forecast full year and fourth quarter annualized net chargeoffs to remain below our normal basis point to basis point range noninterest income has exceeded expectations for the first three quarters and we project full year growth of over benefits from noncustomer income from fhlb dividends are expected to continue but at declining rates as we repay maturing advances risk management income is expected to eventually reduce over time with rates and our swap position for the fourth quarter noninterest income is expected to decline to largely driven by a reduction in capital markets income considering market dynamics and increased selectivity noninterest expenses are expected to increase approximately year over year with of that growth attributed to higher pension expense and almost due to higher fdic expense fourth quarter expenses are projected to increase as we observe pressures related to investments in technology and risk management in addition to third quarter modernization gains that are not expected to repeat while we are not offering guidance we are mindful of the need to mitigate expense pressures as we recognize the new funding paradigm in the industry these pressures are largely concentrated in the need for selective ongoing strategic investments in addition to investments to further enhance risk management and regulatory compliance we are in the process of evaluating cost reduction opportunities with the objective of keeping costs only modestly higher than this assumes no change in pension expense which will be determined largely by yearend rates and market performance prudent expense management remains a priority as we work to balance our expense base commensurate with our earnings power strong profitability is expected to further grow our capital position in excess of our target share repurchases remain paused considering the ongoing volatility within unrealized aoci losses and subject to further regulatory clarity in all it was a solid quarter with strong deposits liquidity fee income and credit we believe we are in great shape as we look to finish out the year and prepare for now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim slide summarizes our differentiated value proposition as a leading bank for business with strong wealth management and retail capabilities our tenured colleagues deliver valueadded industry expertise to our blue chip customer base while our highly regarded approach to credit has historically outperformed our peers complementing our commercial loan expertise our relationship model is exemplified by products tailored to meet our customer needs enhancing revenue and retention our deposit profile has long been a strength with a focus on commercial operating deposits and a consistent retail base with new products already in the market and additional efforts underway to expand small business and payments we expect this core funding source to be even more compelling finally we remain committed to running an efficient organization well be taking steps to offset expense pressures by leveraging investments designed to enhance productivity and optimize resources before we open the line to questions i just want to comment on what a remarkable quarter we think this was for our company after significant industry disruption this past spring once again our relationshipbased model has proved resilient comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 were very proud to see a return to deposit growth especially when the h8 data shows declines across the industry our liquidity is in great shape we repaid significant fhlb advances and our loan to deposit ratio puts us in a very favorable position credit remains strong and fee income continues to perform at near record levels during this disruptive time we are taking care of our customers and won back deposits weve added new relationships and still exceeded profitability expectations as i shared on prior calls throughout our almost 175year history we have managed through a number of challenges and im confident in our ability to navigate this environment we remain focused on our core strategy enhancing efficiency managing risk protecting returns and positioning for organic growth with the uncertain economic landscape and being just under billion in assets i feel very good about comericas position were proud of our colleagues and the performance we delivered and we appreciate your time this morning and now operator wed be happy to take some questions question and answer section operator certainly well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now live jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone hey good morning curt question for you just on one of the last comments you made about deposit growth you mentioned that youre adding and bringing back customer deposits can you talk about the extent of what you brought back and why these clients are coming back and kind of the extent of it and whats left to bring back peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc hey jon this is peter so the bringing back clients i would say a lot of that has occurred probably in our middle market businesses so if you look back to prescb and jim mentioned this for example middle market in california corporate banking were back to prescb levels and those businesses but its true in a couple of our other businesses as well environmental services has that sort of results and middle market overall i think has performed really well a lot of our new deposit growth i would say would be in middle market small business business banking where were really being aggressive on trying to attract granular deposits small business deposits were making a lot of investments there in people and product and so and thats the success that weve had i think as the year has gone on the our customer base and prospects have continued to have a lot of confidence in our name and our success and while all the banks were challenged between march and april we i think weve proven to be pretty resilient through this jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc how rate sensitive are those deposits or is this kind of call it relationship gathering comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc i think its a little bit of both i think some of it is providing confidence overall that occurred early in the year but certainly youre attracting some of it with interestbearing rates that were being competitive on and i mean i think we talk a little bit about what were seeing on our deposit betas here today but so its a little bit of both i think some of its product investment that weve made to make it easier for our customers to manage their liquidity but were certainly doing what we need to do to be competitive with other banks on the interest rate environment jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay jim one for you you kind of danced around this in terms of youre talking about betas moderating and we still have this down net interest income sequentially and down margin but the way things sit today if the fed is done whats your best guess on nii inflection for the company james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah thanks jon and good morning i do feel like the pathway on that inflection point is becoming a little bit more into focus even though there are still some degree of uncertainty i would say right now our base case is that well probably hit a trough in q1 but whether or not thats the inflection point and again that is the base case and more importantly what that upward slope of the line will be from there really depends on a lot of things as you know a lot of uncertainty out there on deposit betas the fed stays higher for longer how do betas respond and just as importantly rate cuts occur how much is there in terms of a deposit pricing by monetary policy loan volume we do anticipate growing at some point in but certainly variable loan pricing is out there as a variable we think that the new funding paradigm commands wider spreads or higher yield but it remains to be seen if the market will accept that so a lot of variables out there but ill just circle back and say at this point we think the trough is likely to be q1 then a little bit of a slope up from there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you appreciate it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks jon operator thank you next question is coming from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ebrahim good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 maybe jim first for you looking at the slide rate sensitivity when we look at so it looks like obviously you have not added any new swaps this year when we look at the trajectory of the swaps in the outlook ph is the jack from the swaps fully baked into as we look into the third quarter or fourth quarter outlook incrementally does it get worse or does it just level off if rates dont change and just give us a sense do you expect any additional changes around balance sheet mix going into next year and whether or not youre thinking about protecting eventually against rate cuts or not james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah ebrahim you were cutting out a little bit but i think i got the gist of the question we are relatively interest neutral its how i think of it right now we do have some swaps that will mature over the next five quarters but we also have a number of forward starters that are coming on to the books over the next five quarters also and so based on the amount of forward starters that are coming on and i think we have more forward starters coming on than maturing swaps i dont see a need to go out and acquire any more swaps now well continue to monitor how the balance sheet responds and noninterestbearing deposits respond which have an impact in that sensitivity equation but for now i feel really comfortable that were well prepared for a drop in rates should they occur ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and i guess maybe just a separate question on credit quality maybe if we can unpack the three areas that you called out on cre leverage loans and tech like how do you expect the losses to evolve within those three buckets and any impact on your sort of auto exposure when we think about the uaw strike and if that gets prolonged if we could see some negative migration or losses melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah ebrahim thank you this is melinda ill just make some overarching comments around credit just to reiterate what both curt and jim said were really proud of the quarter credit continues to hold up really really well as you can see on slide we did have an increase in our criticized assets we absolutely projected that we would continue to see normalization that is exactly how its playing out the majority of the increase in criticized this quarter came from that commercial real estate book and as of right now we do not really see a lot of loss content in that commercial real estate portfolio just as a reminder were very heavily concentrated in construction financing with very strong borrowers and sponsors very low loan to cost is really how we underwrite and its predominantly multifamily and industrial so industrial segment is holding up incredibly well we dont have any criticized assets in industrial multifamily is really where were seeing some of the migration and thats again expected just given what the rate environment has done just as well as a bit of oversupply in certain markets so there is some rent leveling out and starting to see a little bit of rent concessions we have no delinquencies no past dues in this portfolio our sponsors are stepping up as we would have expected them to based on their historical performance and they are covering shortfalls so i do not expect to see losses coming through the commercial real estate portfolio but cautionary we are continuing to build a reserve there so our coverage ratio is up to this quarter which i think is up or basis points from last quarter the chargeoffs that we did see this quarter there is no concentration it was very granular business banking tls middle market but theyre very small in nature so im not really seeing any themes as of right now in terms comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 of like where loss content would come from leverage would be one that it would be very impossible just again because of the elevated rate environment and the cumulative impact of the basis points interest burden on those borrowers automotive production weve got about billion in automotive production loans obviously weve been in this business for many many decades and weve been through many cycles with this customer base i would say overall they are very resilient this particular pool have been relatively stressed honestly from on you have the tariff then youve had covid then you had chip shortages and supply chain disruption but we really havent experienced losses in this sector so were watching the uaw strike very closely the longer it goes on there will be more impact to the portfolio were very well reserved but again we have a lot of experience managing through this and we have a very very strong customer base that knows how to do this so hopefully i hit all of your questions but happy to follow up ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah no that is comprehensive thank you so much melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc welcome operator thank you next question is coming from john pancari from evercore isi your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning on the expense growth commentary for i know you indicated the objective is for keep expense growth modestly higher versus can you it looks like the street is out there modeling maybe to or so yearoveryear can you maybe help us think about what modestly higher could mean whats a reasonable pace of growth to assume as youre looking at the initiatives playing out that youre reviewing thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc john this is curt ill start and then well ask jim to add in some more color commentary first of all maybe just from a backdrop standpoint as you and others on the call are aware and were really record years of performance for our company across the board revenue growth loan growth liquidity really great performance from a roe standpoint in fact at the end of performed in the mid20 range on roe and we were able to do all that and maintain a very low efficiency ratio as jim mentioned and i think i did as well in my comments i do think that we and the whole industry are in this period of transition and through a recalibration as were looking at lower nii really based on funding dynamics comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 and then the second thing id say here is just that there are some anomalies in our numbers we certainly have a pension impact that others maybe do not have everyone has the fdic component so when you factor that out the rate of growth in over is not quite as high as might appear that said we are committed to managing expenses and managing efficiently as a company and as you just said and more modest growth in expenses over but i want to be careful here and just caution that we have been in a new investment or net investment focus of the company weve been doing a lot of things the last two years that we believe are driving revenue growth for us helping us on the client acquisition side a lot of investment in payments treasury management wealth management capital markets weve expanded into some new markets the southeast and colorado a lot of focus on small business so weve got a lot of initiatives underway and i want to keep our focus on those because we believe those are the right things for our company in long term and once we get beyond sort of the period of time that were in right now but having said all that we are going to strike the right balance and weve proven over time in our history that we know how to manage expenses well and we are looking at sort of what levers we have we typically provide some guidance at our fourth quarter call i can go into some more details at that point but we are working on some initiatives we believe will help us reduce expenses and offset some as what we i think is really sort of more nearterm pressure versus longer term pressure jim what would you add to that james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc the only thing i would add is we to reemphasize curts comments we do recognize the new funding paradigm the new profitability equation and i do think theres a lot of work to be done and were committed to getting that work done and i think were going to make significant progress for but i dont view it as a one and done deal either i think this is probably going to play out for some period of time but we have to continue on the cost reduction initiatives to make sure that we can fund the necessary investments so something weve done before we know how to do were committed to there was a pivot in the industry thats occurred over the last few months and were going to have to adjust to that but we do recognize that so fully committed to getting it done and well be sharing more at some later point in time as curt said john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you i appreciate all that detail and then separately i guess when it comes to capital or more specifically capital deployment maybe can you talk about what would you need to see to be willing to ramp up buybacks here just want to get your updated thoughts on the potential for deployment thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah john i would say the number one factor for me is the uncertainty that would be the uncertainty in the general economy and geopolitical events and so on but also uncertainties related to interest rates and aoci we did take a stepup this quarter as the whole industry did and id like to see a better line of sight in terms of where thats going before we turn on share repurchase i would say capital rules are something were watching also i would say thats more of a secondary factor were well below billion but we do want to be prepared in case things change in the economy with whether it be monetary policy or anything else that may catapult us towards billion faster than were expecting but the uncertainty is really the key factor there i will note that even with our share repurchase we do have one of the stronger common dividends in the industry so we do feel like were returning capital to shareholders but i would love to buy at these prices also we think the share price is a comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 fantastic buy and very attractive the idea of buying back those shares is very attractive but certainly for this year we are on pause and then well assess the uncertainty factor as we get into curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim i would add that while we have been cautious on rwa and managing down some aspects of our loan portfolio thats not sort of our longterm perspective our longterm objective we do want to grow again as a company we see opportunities to grow really based on sort of how the economy plays out as we get into and thats always the first place we want to use our capital is around the loan growth equation and then secondly john i think you are aware that weve done a good job over the course of the last three years or four years of leveraging buybacks and so we do think its an important tool of again sort of balancing between the two will be really important john pancari q analyst evercore group llc makes sense thanks so much curt operator thank you next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone so want to go back to your response to jon arfstrom his question where you said nii would likely bottom in the first quarter maybe jim from a nim view do you see nim following the same trajectory maybe stepping down in then and then we bottom there james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning steve thanks for the question i mean as always ill put my disclaimer out there that were not doing a nim percentage shop the lumpiness of our commercial business model often results in a nim percentage that doesnt necessarily correlate with income so one that i am always hesitant to comment on ill just say in general that i do expect nim percentage to improve as we bring down cash and purchase funds over the next quarter so i do think well see some positive traction there and i do think its fair to in a very general way to say if we see net interest income troughing in q1 thats likely the trough for nim also so well continue to keep an eye on that but thats what i would say big picture steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then jim given the comments that youre fairly neutral now in terms of alco positioning if rates stay higher for longer i know you dont like commenting on it but im going to ask you anyway directionally speaking if we bottom in the first quarter how do you think wed trend through the year assuming no cuts assuming the fed just stays really on hold do you think directionally nim trends favorably through the year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thats going to depend on some of those variables that i mentioned early on loan growth loan spread pricing those are all big factors but i do think that if we do stay higher for longer and ph qt continues that does have the potential to put pressure on nim its not our base case its not what the forward curve is saying higher for longer but we havent been in this situation in a long time as an economy and an industry so its really hard to say but we will see some continued deposit pressures if we do stay higher for longer i believe curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc steve i do think that we have been very successful on the overall pricing side on the lending side obviously taking into account sort of all relationships and doing the right thing by our customers and so i think theres a chance for us to offset some of that just by pricing discipline and potentially loan growth in james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah as i mentioned earlier thanks curt i mean we do feel like we have the right to ask for the proper pricing relative to our cost of funds and to the extent there is less liquidity in the economy deposit pricing cost of funding goes up i would expect to recover a piece of that or perhaps all of it in our pricing equation but again well see what the market allows and what we can demand from it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i know one of the factors is noninterestbearing levels right which were down again this quarter but im curious are you seeing customers still optimize and move balances out and search for higher yield or is it just back to spending cash james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc steven thats actually one of the areas of encouragement to me i mentioned that the deposit betas are growing moderated in recent weeks i would also say the same is true of noninterestbearing deposits if i look month by month since the disruption in the spring the decline in noninterestbearing deposits has slowed up every month and it was essentially flat from august to september im not saying it will always continue to be flat but i do think that these corporate treasurers manage their own cash levels theyre starting to hit that floor where they need a certain amount of cash to run their businesses and were really seeing a slow up as a result we think theyve squeezed that orange about as much as they can now could there be a little bit more to go yes its possible but we do think that the trend is our friend in this case and were really seeing a flattening out of the noninterest bearing decline so i dont see a lot of decline occurring at this point in time probably a little bit more but i think were well past the worst of it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc if i could squeeze one final one in i hear all the comments around moderating expense growth in but if we step out if we look at this quarter revenue was down year over year expenses were up year over year we know why but earnings are down as you guys think about the next year are there levers to pull to start generating more meaningful operating leverage or is it just a tough environment do you have to just wait for comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 the yield curve to improve and other things or do you sense we need to do more here and theres other levers we could pull to get at least earnings heading in a more favorable direction thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well steven i would just say in general as a company we are always committed to delivering positive operating leverage short term thats a bit more challenging as you just outlined for us for all the reasons that we know but two things there one first and foremost we are focused on top line revenue growth and we believe weve got great momentum there with the things i outlined to you previously whether its product expansion and capabilities treasury management capital markets et cetera we continue to add talent in many of our areas we just have a very successful lift out of a wealth management team in southern california and the expansion into the southeast but also just adding depth in the existing markets that we operate in and i do believe that we will continue to drive fee income and that loan growth will return for us in well provide more guidance at our fourth quarter earnings call so were focused there on the revenue side and then secondly we are going to be focused on the expenses and weve done that historically well as a company and we want to be careful to strike the right balance between sort of shortterm expense management and sort of the longerterm investment in the company so i cant promise sort of when does that sort of positive operating leverage equation tilt but its our objective and we are very focused on delivering positive operating leverage for the company and for our investors long term steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions operator thank you next question is coming from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sounds great good morning hey good morning jim or curt maybe on the billion coming back to that youre you are about below that how are you thinking i guess within the budget for expenses like what needs to be spent to be compliant for billion i guess whats already been spent that you could kind of grandfather in and then also can you remind us on the pension expense i think its tied to the 10year and just remind us the magnitude of how youre thinking about it this year was a big year thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc all right chris im going to take the beginning of that question on the billion target and ill let jim address the pension issue we obviously with the significant buildup in deposits we were getting closer to the billion mark which we really never thought was maybe a sustainable situation that we had a lot of buildup in liquidity because of sort of stimulus and monetary policy overall so that has pulled down as weve moderated some on the rwa side of the equation we are very comfortably right now below that billion mark at billion and comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 if you just look at organic growth which has always been our focus as a company it would take us some time we think to get back over the billion mark so its important that we are positioned to be over a billion in terms of regulatory compliance of what would be required to be a category iv bank and weve had our projects and initiatives underway for some time were probably through sort of what would be necessary for us to comply in terms of the technology and sort of infrastructure to support that but weve got some time to sort of make that happen but it is one of the expenses that has applied some additional expense pressure for us sort of longer term i made some comments previously that i think at one of the investor conferences just around ma and just maybe just to be clear there nothing has changed for us in that equation getting close to billion does not change whether we would do ma or not we were focused first and foremost as i said earlier on organic growth its just the deal came along and we still had to make great strategic sense for us and again we think we can sort of manage where we are today and weve got some time to sort of evaluate the landscape longer term but i dont anticipate any sort of pressure on the billion level at least for the foreseeable next couple of years james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah and i might take that even a step further chris you mentioned below we do plan on repaying more debt in the fourth quarter well get the full quarter effect of what we did in the third quarter so we do see cash and purchase funds coming down another billion in the fourth quarter on average ph on a lending basis more like probably billion or billion so we are well below the billion now as aoci comes back and we make we have loan growth well start moving back towards billion but as curt said were probably a few years away from that and ill just say that in terms of what were focused on in terms of complying with billion as it might impact expenses were only focused on that subsection of the requirements that potentially take more than a couple years to make sure youre comfortable with so those things that have a longer tail to them we are focused on working on and that will be one of the expense pressures we have to offset but we dont feel like we need to jump into it entirely in terms of getting ready at this point in time a lot of the requirements we can wait until were a little bit closer to a billion in terms of the pension question pension accounting is one of our favorite topics and a great one to waddle through a lot of variables there but interest rates are the key one market performance in general but interest rates most specifically if you go back to our k we do have a sensitivity in there that shows that for every bps rate change the 10year is a pretty good proxy for our liability and the assets we have offsetting that every bps translates to about million of expense so obviously we strike that in theres been a big stepup since then but i would also say there are other variables that are likely to make us come in below what that sensitivity would suggest most importantly we have a number of amortized credits from past actuarial assumptions that we all performed on and so we will perform that sensitivity but a lot of variables involved there so thats something well have more clarity on as we approach the end of the year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats really helpful thanks jim just one final one in terms of the targeted i guess level of cash and bonds on the balance sheet you havent reinvested the bonds in the last year remind us either as a percentage of earning assets or maybe an absolute level where you could ultimately see those levels shrinking down to comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah thats going to depend on just the overall composition of the balance sheet how close we are to billion as it might relate to liquidity rules and debt requirements but i would see us moving closer towards billion billion securities probably closer to billion so we have a ways to go and what that might suggest is were likely not going to be buying securities at least for the next couple of years christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you chris operator thank you next question is coming from manan gosalia from morgan stanley your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc manan good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to follow up on your comments on aoci i mean i think you noted that you havent added any swaps in the books this year given that the 10year is up another basis points this quarter how are you thinking about managing aoci risk here james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc well at this point we dont feel like we have to do anything synthetically to manage it were okay with where were at based on the burn off that we see over the next couple of years and really more importantly the burn off over the next five years as we potentially become a category iv bank and so at this point in time we are comfortable with where were at we do think that as we move closer towards category iv we will consider modifying our strategies to maybe shorten the duration of the securities whether that be with what we purchased or doing something synthetically but for the time being we dont feel compelled to do anything were comfortable with the burn off that we see over the next few years manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it so as theres clearly some volatility on the long end of the curve does it make sense to use the same dv01 for aoci that you saw this quarter and then apply to changes in the 10year in future quarters to figure out the aoci risk there james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 i think thats a pretty good proxy yeah you can see a little bit of movement one way or the other but i think its a good proxy for future rate changes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe finally just on the i think you mentioned a pull to par on unrealized losses over the next couple of years how is that impacted by the rate environment james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc well that considers the curve as it stands today so not just spot rates but where the curve is so to the extent the entire curve shifts up or down that will have an impact on that burn off but for now this obviously contemplates the entire spectrum of the curve manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc and if the curve moves higher then the pull to par will be longer and if it moves lower then the pull to par will be sooner james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thats right and we do have a sensitivity on that on slide in the bottom right so you can see what a bp movement would do one way or the other manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you manan operator thank you next question today is coming from brody preston from ubs your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone i just wanted to ask could you give us a reminder i think it was the gear up initiative that you had in the past could you remind me what the if you happen to know what the total kind of i guess expenses you kind of took out of the run rate or kind of like im just im trying to remember what you did in the past comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah brody i would not go back through all that detail with you i might just say that in general the gear up was a combination of expenses but also some revenue enhancement opportunities that weve focused on some of that was around capability some of it was around pricing strategies et cetera and it was not just a single year impact it was an impact that we probably we put in place to improve overall efficiency what was at that point a very low rate environment so if youre looking at sort of applicability to today i mean were a bigger company in terms of our overall revenue base as an organization and our expense base as well and so were going to think about this in a thoughtful way on a goforward if youre kind of driving to sort of what expense reductions we might look at and look at things that really minimize anything associated with revenue and customers and really try to focus on areas real estate from a technology spend that we might be more careful with vacancy rates in terms of head count et cetera and well have more to potentially share as we get into the outlook for brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you for that i wanted to ask a couple of questions to melinda melinda you said you talked a little bit about the multifamily and the migration there but the sponsors have kind of stepped up to cover any shortfalls when you say shortfalls do you mean like theyre multifamily properties that are falling below one debt service coverage ratio melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc it could be that they are in the process of being leased up and so theyre behind schedule but the biggest driver right now in the multifamily space in terms of any kind of a shortfall is really because of the rising rate environment the majority of their loans are floating rate so theyve been absorbing the rate increase of basis points over the last four five quarters and so there could be a shortfall in an interest reserve that we require during the construction phase or a debt service coverage during the lease up phase as those are going into stabilization brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and are there any markets that you look at across your footprint and say maybe theres new supply coming on that might exacerbate any of these issues like any of that come to mind in particular melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah i think the market where weve seen the most challenged and the most migration again reminders now that the migration has been very manageable and criticized loans in the commercial real estate book are still relatively low but the migration is really concentrated in the california some of the sub markets northern california being the most impacted at this point and then southern california so were watching those really really closely and again the customer base there and sponsor base i would consider exceptionally strong and we have tenured colleagues that know how to manage through this so we feel really good about our strategy there we feel really good about the product set but multifamily has had a tremendous amount of supply come to market and theres more to come so i expect that well continue to see some modest level of migration in that portfolio comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i know its a very small portfolio for you guys but do you happen to have what the reserve is on the office portfolio at this point melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc we dont have a reserve specifically on the asset classes but we do have coverage ratio for the commercial real estate book as a whole and its brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and jim i just wanted to follow up on the swap question the swaps that you said youve got forward starting coming on thatll outpace anything thats maturing thats all reflected in the kind of lock up on the swaps book that james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc absolutely it is brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great i just wanted to make sure and then just last one for you for i know its a smaller portion of the book but for the true fixed portion not the swapped floating portion can you walk us through what the maturity schedule looks like over the next months and kind of what the what the yields are that are rolling off versus what current originations those are are right now james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah its really a relatively small part of our book and i dont see it having a big impact on yields next year i think somewhere in the appendix you would surmise fixed rate loans organically speaking are about of our book and they have pretty long maturities to years on average so you dont see a lot come up for repricing every year we might see million come up this in to use a kind of an average and they are priced below our current loan yields so there is some opportunity there but i wouldnt see fixed rate repricing having more than a couple of bps of impact on our loan yields next year there is a little bit there is a bit of favorable impact brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc do you have any security maturities that are lumpy and lower yielding at any point in the next months james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc we have our normal what ill consider to be smooth roll off of mbss and we do have some treasuries ensuring over the next months but i would say those arent necessarily lumpy we see a little bit in most quarters so we obviously are going to benefit in from securities maturing as we redeploy that either into cash earning much higher yields or avoid purchase funds so net net we will see a benefit from fixed asset repricing next year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 tiny bit from loans youll certainly get a nice lift up from securities fixed rate swaps actually go the other direction but the net benefit will be favorable in brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for taking my questions overall james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks brody operator thank you next question is coming from ken usdin from jefferies your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning i want to ask a question on the loan book and on the business line basis youre not under any kind of like dieting so to speak but after you got out of mortgage banker this year just theres a couple of these lines that are getting a little smaller over time like tech and life sciences and equity fund just wanted to ask like how much of that is environmental and do you envision taking a harder look at any of the loan categories that you have in terms of what youre thinking about in terms of future growth opportunities peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc hey ken this is peter yeah weve got some of our businesses that have kind of continued to drift down this quarter and quite candidly probably well into the fourth quarter and maybe even in the first quarter but we dont really see any additional changes to the lines of business that were in we do feel really good about the portfolio on a goforward basis i do think that in the environment with increased expectations around profitability and pricing and im just sort of managing our balance sheet some businesses are impacted more than others but as we get into next year well try to give a little more guidance on what we think loan outlook looks like for but i suspect a few of these businesses that youve kind of seen creep down here as of late probably be another quarter or two before we start to go the other direction overall with our general portfolio middle market business banking small business our pipelines there are still pretty good relatively it depends on the geography a little bit and were trying to add customers and add new business in that space as we get into the end of the year and into next ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great thanks and my followup is just on the expenses can you just explain like the kind of the write back on the modernization this quarter how does that mechanically work and then just making sure that i understand that the fourth quarter guide is built on the all in number thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah ken the modernization expenses were actually a net credit because of the real estate gain that you saw in the third quarter that we noted on the expense slides that was the offset by some expenses but modernization expenses were in that negative million or million credit for the quarter we would expect that to be a little closer to zero for the fourth quarter we may have an additional real estate sale that could give us something in the low single digits of millions but overall i dont expect modernization to be a big driver of fourth quarter expenses ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it right so that okay and then the fourth quarter guide is built on the aside from the deferred comp that you dont expect to repeat the fourth quarter expense guide is built off of the ph million james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thats right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay got it thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you ken operator thank you next question today is coming from brandon king from truist securities your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey hey good morning just putting the pieces together how are you thinking about balance sheet growth next year particularly with earning assets are you kind of looking to keep things stable or could we see some incremental growth comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc brandon its jim ill start off and peter may want to chime in here but weve been very focused on stabilizing the funding base and the liquidity base in recent months as you know we got a lot of success there were actually in better shape than we actually thought we would be back in the spring with the loan to deposit ratio of i think it was right now its been a period of recalibration were focused on getting the right mix of customers right mix of businesses getting the right pricing and then we expect this to be at some point to be at a point where we start growing loans at a more normal pace again were not quite there yet but we expect to be there at some point in with loan growth but right now were still going through that period of recalibration whether it be getting more certainty around our deposit base getting the right mix in terms of business lines but we do anticipate some type of balance sheet growth at some point in peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah brandon i might just add to what jim said i mean were also seeing a lot of i would say caution in our customer base theres a lot of headline risk i think you might see as we go into next year and melinda has talked a lot about credit but were prepared that it could be a tougher economic environment and well just navigate successfully we always have as a company really well so what that looks like for loan demand per se is probably to be determined i mean well give some more guidance as weve mentioned on loans when we get into the fourth quarter call for next year but we do think well get back to loan growth next year i think we just dont know necessarily what that looks like just yet with the environment with interest rates where they are and to the extent that we enter a more challenging economic environment well have to navigate that and again it also depends on business by business what that may look like in geography by geography brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it and then could you speak to deposit seasonality flows what are your kind of expectations near term and just how close you think we are to maybe a normal seasonality trends james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah brandon seasonality has really been a tough one in the last couple of years the typical seasonal trends that we see amongst different business units whether it be loans or deposits its kind of gone out the window so were waiting to see whether or not those return back to normal seasonality patterns were in a higher interest rate environment and to what extent a different liquidity environment too in terms of overall liquidity in the economy so it remains to be seen if we do return back to those typical patterns that weve seen in the past as i mentioned we may have a very small bit of seasonality assumed in our outlook but not a lot so we do see some potential for upside there but frankly it just feels like deposit seasonality much like many other patterns remains to be seen in this new paradigm as to whether or not we return back to the old normal or not brandon king q analyst truist securities inc all right thats all that i had thanks for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 thank you brandon curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator thank you next question coming from peter winter from da davidson your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co hi good morning just going back to the expense outlook does that already contemplate some expenses initiatives or as you go through the budgeting process though theres opportunities for maybe some additional expenses versus bank guidance curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter its a bit of both we havent been sitting on our hands so to speak and have been looking at opportunities to slow expense growth and to be more prudent we have some other things that are still in process if you think ph of us for the planning process for so well again have more to share potentially as we get into the fourth quarter earnings call peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay and then just one housekeeping just what was the end of period balance on mortgage banker loans just curious how much is left to runoff james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah mortgage banker i mean for the quarter we were at million a little bit lower than that for ending i dont know curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc and i think period end was around million james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah so curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 so but well what weve communicated there peter is that we expect the balances to be pretty minimal by the end of the year period end might be a couple of hundred million peter
