portfolio to affiliates and limited partners of carlyle and kkr firstmark a division of nelnet will assume responsibility for servicing the portfolio upon sale this agreement represents an important milestone in our journey to simplify our operations and business mix the completion of the sale also has financial implications which john greene will detail in a few moments as we continue to resolve past issues and strengthen our risk management and compliance posture we have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the merchant class action associated with the card misclassification litigation subject to court approval the decision to settle was based upon our internal reviews extensive dialogue with key constituencies including merchants and regulators and our pending merger with capital one the settlement agreement would resolve claims by parties affected by the card misclassification including merchants acquirers and intermediaries our current remediation reserve is sufficient to cover the expenses under the terms of the settlement agreement our results also benefited from a litigation settlement in our payment services segment where discover was the plaintiff were happy to have this matter resolved and are satisfied with the favorable financial outcome finally turning to our pending merger with capital one capital one continues to lead the integration planning process and the teams are working well together on integration planning and regulatory applications upcoming mergerrelated milestones include a virtual public hearing hosted by the federal reserve and the occ the completion of the written comment period and inperson public hearing with the delaware state bank commissioner and the filing of the definitive merger proxy we expect shareholder votes to occur this fall we are encouraged by how the merger planning and application processes are progressing and continue to believe that the strategic rationale operating scale and economics of the combined company are compelling with that ill now ask john greene to review our second quarter financial results john t greene executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services thank you michael and good morning everyone ill start with our summary financial results on slide in the quarter we reported net income of billion which was up from the prior year quarter our fundamental performance in the period was driven by revenue expansion from loan growth higher net interest margin and non interest revenue growth credit continues to perform in line with expectations supporting our view that losses are near peak and will plateau during the second half of there are several unusual items which impacted the quarter these included a million student loan reserve release a gain of million from the sale of our lake park facility and largely offsetting one another were the favorable litigation settlement and a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification matter excluding unusual items we would have reported net income of approximately million an eps of about per share lets review the details beginning on slide our net interest margin ended the quarter at up basis points from the prior year and up basis points sequentially on a quarteroverquarter basis margin expansion was primarily driven by a lower card promotional balance mix as anticipated receivable growth continues to normalize from its early peak discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 card receivables increased yearoveryear due to a lower payment rate and a smaller contribution from new accounts the payment rate declined about basis points compared to last year and it is now about basis points above levels discover card sales were down compared to the prior year spending at restaurants which is a large category for sales volume declined sequentially as a result of being included in the promotion during the first quarter accounting for the influence of promotional categories sales trends are relatively stable we continue to see a cautious consumer evidenced by less card member spend with lower income households being most affected personal loans were up from their prior year period in response to market conditions we prudently tightened underwriting over the past year which has served to modestly reduce originations student loans were down yearoveryear as michael mentioned we have entered into an agreement to sell our student loan portfolio we expect the transaction to be completed in four tranches by the end of the purchase price is at a premium to the principal balance and is based on a formula that varies depending on the closing timing interest rates and other factors in association with this development student loans are now accounted for as held for sale the two most notable impacts to the financial statements are that we will no longer maintain a credit reserve for student loans and future student loan net chargeoffs will be recognized through operating expense rather than credit losses average consumer deposits were up yearoveryear and sequentially deposit balances are being managed in relation to our liquidity needs which will benefit from the student loan sale our disciplined approach to deposit pricing has led to a modest reduction in average deposit rates in the second quarter consistent with our practice of leading the industry on pricing in down parts of the cycles looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or discount and interchange revenue was up million as a result of lower rewards cost our rewards rate was basis points in the period a decrease of basis points versus the prior year quarter the decline reflects lower cashback match other income increased due to unusual items including the litigation settlement and the facility sale on an adjusted basis noninterest revenue grew moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear the most significant driver of this increase was a charge for expected regulatory penalties related to the card misclassification issue it is important to note that actual penalties imposed are subject to further discussions and may be more or less than this amount adjusting for this charge our expenses would have increased by year overyear looking at our major expense categories compensation costs increased million or primarily due to an increase in business technology resources professional fees were up million or driven by higher recovery fees and investments in compliance and risk management our expectation for compliance and risk management expenses for the full year remains in the million range with an upside bias this figure excludes card misclassificationrelated cost moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and down basis points from the prior quarter in card delinquency formation improvement continued the 30plus day delinquency rate was down basis points versus the prior quarter discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 from a vintage perspective our card vintage continues to perform in line with our vintage as we look into the second half of the year we expect there could be some variability in monthly card losses from both seasonality and various credit management actions weve taken this has not changed our broader outlook for losses to generally peak and plateau this year turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our credit reserve balances declined million from the prior quarter reflecting the student loan reserve release partially offset by a million reserve build primarily to support loan growth our reserve rate was just over largely unchanged after adjusting for student loans looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was up basis points bolstered by core earnings generation and the reserve release we declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock concluding on slide we have revised our outlook and have included the impacts of the pending student loan sale we are updating our loan growth expectations to be down lowsingle digits reflecting the roughly billion asset sale absent this yearoveryear loan growth would be consistent with our prior view we are increasing our net interest margin range to to this change was driven by two factors we now anticipate higher card yields reflecting a lower promotional balance mix and the student loan sale which increases nim by about basis points our operating expense guidance is unchanged notwithstanding the inclusion of the student loan net chargeoffs in this line item our base case for net chargeoffs remains at the low end of the to range this includes the basis points impact from student loans and finally our capital management expectations have not changed to summarize we continue to generate solid financial results remain steadfast in our efforts to resolve compliance matters and look forward to consummating our planned merger this concludes our remarks ill turn the call back over to the operator operator this concludes todays call the discover investor relations team will be available for questions thank you for joining you may
