to everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter performance in addition to robert and john also joining on the line are sandro dinello president and ceo of flagstar and lee smith president of flagstar mortgage in addition to our earnings release this morning we announced that nycb and flagstar mutually agreed to extend our merger agreement by approximately six months to october in conjunction with the expansion both banks amended the merger agreement to provide that the combined company will operate under a national bank charter although we recently received new york state dfs approval and we are very much appreciative of this both sides truly believe that a national bank charter is an appropriate charter for the new organization under the revised agreement the necessary regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger will come from the fed reserve and the occ despite the expansion the benefits of this transformational deal remain the same today as it did when we announced the deal one year ago the merger of our two great organizations provides many benefits including geographical and product diversification it also accelerates our plan to transform our business model to a multifaceted commercial bank indiscernible strong sustainable financial performance and capital generation additionally it dramatically improves our overall funding profile and interest rate positioning the combination of our two balance sheets will create a pro forma balance sheet that is asset sensitive and significantly deposit funded over the past months both sides have worked very closely together to get us into a position to close the deal once regulatory approvals are received we have a detailed integration plan in place all major systems ph have been determined and my leadership team has been appointed both sides are ready to go and importantly the deal still meets all of our financial metrics despite the change in interest rates and in the mortgage business we still forecast doubledigit earnings per share accretion while tangible book value new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 accretion is now expected to be to on day one double what we envisioned when we initially announced the deal having worked together over the past year we feel very confident in our cost savings assumptions and while we have not modeled or assumed any revenue synergies we know that there are multiple revenue enhancement opportunities more importantly we are still not assuming any financial engineering such as buybacks and balance sheet repositioning in our accretion numbers turning now to our first quarter results for the first quarter of we reported diluted earnings per share of a share up compared to a share for the first quarter of were extremely pleased with our results this quarter as we reported continued growth in loans net income earnings per share and deposits as well as lower operating expenses margin expansion and continued exceptional asset quality turning now to the details of our quarterly performance i would like to start off with the exceptional deposit growth we reported for the quarter since i was appointed ceo on january 1st of last year theres been a significant cultural shift in our approach to bringing in deposits during we embarked on a number of initiatives designed to increase our deposits and lessen our reliance on alternative funding sources that are less traditional in the commercial banking space such as wholesale borrowings as a result since yearend to today total deposits have increased billion or to billion and core deposits have increased billion to billion during the current first quarter total deposits rose nearly billion compared to the fourth quarter of last year this was driven by growth in our banking as a service business as we continue to gain traction add staff launch new initiatives in this area total baasrelated deposits were billion at march a significant increase since we started the business from scratch months ago baasrelated deposits fall under three categories baas deposits tied to our fintech partnerships totaling billion so far government baas deposits of million and mortgage as a service deposits of million last year we won several mandates for our banking as a service business more recently we were selected by the bureau of ph the fiscal service as a financial agent for the us treasurys prepaid debit card program this is a big win for us and we should begin to see benefits materializing from this relationship later this year we also continue to make significant progress in garnering deposits from our borrowers total loan related deposits rose million during the first quarter to billion up sequentially this compares to growth of million for all of last year all in all since we began focusing on the source of funding early last year weve gotten over million of incremental loanrelated deposits up since yearend in addition earlier this year we relaunched our directbank channel mybankingdirectcom while it was just rolled out in march early receptivity has been very positive we have an active pipeline of additional opportunities that should benefit our deposit gathering initiatives including those focusing on baas type of fintech companies now moving on to loan growth after billion in loan growth during the fourth quarter of last year total loans grew by billion during the first quarter to billion up annualized on a linked quarter basis once again the majority of the growth was in the multifamily portfolio which increased billion during the quarter to billion up annualized compared to the previous quarter loan demand in the multifamily category continues to be driven by increased refinancing activity as the outlook in continues to call for higher interest rates higher property transactions and less competition from both other banks and gses the specialty finance portfolio of billion at the end of the first quarter was down million compared to the prior quarter this was largely the result of one pay off otherwise the specialty finance portfolio would have been new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 relatively unchanged at march the specialty finance portfolio had billion in total commitments up compared to yearend of that amount or billion are structured as floating rate obligations with the recent increase in treasury rates weve also increased our lending rates on multifamily loans several times during the past quarter and well continue to do so as market rates increase our current multifamily pricing is in the to range depending on the type of credit that is about basis points to basis points higher than at the end of last year its very important to note that we have approximately billion of multifamily and cre loan that come up on their contractual maturity date or option repricing date over the next two years so borrowers have to act within that timeframe despite the increase in rates we still continue to have strong originations and a growing pipeline loan originations continue their strong pace into the first quarter total first quarter originations were billion up billion or compared to the first quarter of last year first quarter originations exceeded the previous quarters pipeline by billion or of the first quarters originations were refinances in our portfolio were refinances from other banks portfolio and were due to property transactions speaking of the pipeline the pipeline heading into the second quarter of was a strong billion compared to billion last quarter up of this amount of the loans in the pipeline represented new money to the bank moving now onto asset quality our credit trends in asset quality remains exceptional and continue to rank among the best in the industry nonperforming assets totaled million or basis points of total assets as of march while we charged off a mere million during the quarter our delinquency trends continue to improve with loans to days past due declining million or to million compared to december lastly principal only loan deferrals declined to million compared to the previous quarter and we continue to have zero full payment deferrals before proceeding id like to provide an update on the new york city real estate market the residential real estate market in new york city has improved significantly the rental market is currently facing strong demand and low inventory levels as discounts and concessions expire and rental prices approach new records manhattans median rent in march was at the highest level on record although vacancy rate remained below for the fourth consecutive month in brooklyn the median rent exceeded prepandemic levels for the first time while new lease signing and indiscernible reached a 10year high moving on to the income statement first quarter net interest income rose on a yearoveryear basis excluding the impact from prepayment net interest income rose on a yearoveryear basis to million in addition excluding merger related expenses first quarter preprovision revenue increased on a yearover year basis to million turning to the net interest margin our margin for the first quarter was excluding the impact from prepayment income the first quarter nim was up basis points on a linked quarter basis and in line with our expectations on the expense side we continue to be pleased with our expense discipline excluding mergerrelated expenses of million operating expenses for the first quarter were million up million or on a yearoveryear basis our efficiency ratio remained below for the first quarter of the year it was at yesterdays meeting the board of directors declared a per share dividend on common shares the dividend will be paid on may to common shareholders of record as of may based on yesterdays closing price this translates to an annualized dividend yield of new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 lastly i would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to achieve another exceptional quarter with that we would be happy to answer the questions you may have we will do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or during the week operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey morning tom i guess first question just in terms of the margin outlook in light of the deal timing getting pushed out so two questions there one any additional clarity around when this deal could close is it is there a chance it still closes in the second quarter or should we be thinking more about or maybe even fourth quarter given the extension date and secondly tied to that what does that mean for the core margin with the fed expected to hike maybe basis points in the second quarter i went back and saw looked at like your margin went down basis points yearoveryear fourth quarter over just give us a sense because thats going to be a concern around what happens to nyb margin in light of the fed actions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so ebrahim let me just point out the big picture view of us and flagstar coming together ph theyre asset sensitive or liability sensitive i would say were probably less liability sensitive today than we were when we cited that move so we take a very significant asset sensitive bank like flagstar and we consummate the merger this year this will have in my opinion a very positive position in a rising rate environment going into so were very appreciative of the balance sheet coming together with unique positioning us being slightly liability sensitive and flagstar being asset sensitive so collectively when we come together going into it will positioned well for that rising rate environment that being said im going to defer to mr pinto on the shortterm guidance on the audio gap john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah for the second quarter we expect the net interest margin exprepays to be flat to q1 and we have a couple of things going on in the quarter we as weve talked on our last calls we have the full benefit of the hedge rolling off that rolled off in february so we have some we ph are flat for the second new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 quarter and then depending on what happens with interest rates well see what happens in the third and fourth quarter therell be some pressure on the market ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and john what are you assuming for fed to do in the second quarter as part of that flat margin guidance john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc basis points in may basis points in june ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and tom any thoughts around the timing of the deal like is the occ approval in that process will it be will it by default push it out into later in the year or is there a likelihood the deal closes in the second quarter thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so we were very clear in our press release this morning that we put out on october data out there and were comfortable with that timeframe based on where we are in the regulatory process we cant really dive into specifically but were hopeful that we will meet that timeframe and we feel thats a reasonable timeframe ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one last question maybe for lee gain on sale reset lower i dont think totally surprising in the first quarter for flagstar we didnt see any expense offset would love to hear one where do you think gain on sale goes from here and is there anything on the expense side that you can do that offsets that revenue that weve seen over the last couple of quarters lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah thanks for that question so yeah margins are obviously under pressure given the excess capacity in the system at the moment weve gone from a trillion market last year and right now theyre forecasting a trillion market so people are working to remove that capacity but until its gone its going to put pressure on margins what i would say when you look at our margin we were down basis points quarteroverquarter a big piece of that was the ebos we had million of gain on sale benefit in the fourth quarter and we had million in q1 so when you look at that reduction of basis points quarteroverquarter basis points was because of the ebos and then you had about basis points mix and volatility and basis points was competitiveness and thats just waiting for that excess capacity to exit the system in terms of what weve done from a cost point of view remember to of our mortgage costs are variable or semivariable so we have that flexibility but we have taken additional actions weve rightsized that infrastructure and unfortunately weve had to layoff employees in two waves one at the end of march and one at the end of april and then a further employees have attrited that we havent replaced for a total reduction of since to put that into perspective thats a reduction in our total mortgage employees new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 since or of our mortgage operation staff in terms of what impact that has from a dollar point of view we think it will save us about million million in the second quarter and then going forward from q3 onwards it will be about million in savings ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great hey good morning just a question on the banking as a service deposits can you speak to the rates that are currently being paid on those and your expectations for betas as the fed moves thanks thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc im going to just take it in general weve been very successful with this initiative and our focus on dealing with our fintech partnerships in particular dealing with government opportunities the typical depositor relationship there is zero cost for that type of relationship that should kick in as more programs come to place and treasury department starts rolling out new initiatives and as the government starts to deal with the various agencies and how theyre going to distribute cardlike programs we will get the benefit of zero float there as far as the other deposits it varies mortgage as a service is typically tied towards libor either plus or minus a spread and then when you look at the fintech partnerships they can go from zero to as to libor less some type of spread depending on the relationship we were very fortunate in the quarter to win a very unique piece of business we are one of the few banks i think its one of six to deal with fiatbased stablecoin exchanges that we hold reserve accounts for that is a new initiative of ours as we focus on stablecoin this has been a very successful venture for us and we continue to look at that as opportunistic at the same time we have a significant amount of partnerships that were working on onboarding and were building staff around that indiscernible true fintech partnership of banking as a service for a lot of these challenger institutions that have banking operations but theyre not an fdicinsured institution so we are working as the bank provider and the banking as a service provider for those types of initiatives but they do vary and the goal here is that that coupled with a significant push towards getting our fair share of deposits from our customers on the loan side is our strategy for the future and its been very successful since last year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and if i could add one more i think you said in the prepared remarks tangible book accretion is going to be what you thought can you help with where you believe cet1 will shake out and kind of remind us what either if thats your binder or which one your binder is thanks new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc id say indiscernible the flagstar transaction closing were probably higher on a tier capital perspective probably hovering close to so i think maybe john pinto could add some more color john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah originally we anticipated a tier common equity ratio to be so just given the growth in tangible book that will be slightly higher so itll probably be just under right now is our estimate christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc you got it operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone can you give more color on the decision to go the route of the national bank charter and you said you received nysdfs approval was the fdic a roadblock in getting this deal approved thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc well im not going to comment on any agency i will tell you that we truly believe that with the national banking platform and where were heading the bank in the future that the occ charter is the way to go so clearly were much very much appreciative of dfs approval and im not going to comment on any other regulatory discussions there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay but what can you go into the decision to switch to the national charter thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i just did as we and i do appreciate the question and it can be sensitive on the commentary but we went through a journey through this process its now a year through the approval process as we went through this process we feel very confident that the business model is focused on a national mortgage banking platform and a national commercial banking platform that will be more inclined for an occ charter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay tom will there be any additional costs or oversight with this type of charter versus previous thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i would say in general well its probably going to be very similar to the structure with respect to costs i think the efficiencies of the mortgage banking business there may be some savings on licensing and things of that nature and complexities around states and municipal deposits and things of that nature but overall it would be immaterial steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and in terms of the fed and occ now has that process been ongoing or are you now just starting that process with them thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so steven you would assume that the fed has had our applications since may of last year so theyre very familiar with the process we gave a relatively short window to get this closed which is october which is two quarters from now six months and were confident that thats the adequate timeframe to achieve these approval based on where we are in the approval process steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then finally so if i look at new york community right the company has made a lot of progress in months time since youve been ceo youre changing a lot on the funding side we know the market at least at the moment its not a fan of the mortgage banking business and if you look at flagstars results you can get a sense ph why were talking about gain on sale margins compressing so much and here you extended the merger agreement im not suggesting you should have called the deal off but can you walk us through so you made the decision to extend what does this give you that you couldnt have accomplished on your own like why did it make sense for nycb shareholders here to extend the agreement thanks thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so steven so again were not going to waver from our original discussion we put the deal in front of both sandro and i we looked at this opportunity we had an opportunity here to look at the mortgage business with full knowledge that will be dramatically less than it was in we modeled down so i would say what we know of the company right now based on their forecast were right in line what we expected this is not a surprise with that being said the deposit rich franchise and transforming this company into a full service commercial bank from a traditional thrift model is a catalyst weve done so much work around what the opportunities on revenue enhancements changing the verticals putting these companies together to build a great institution thats well diversified and a national footprint we believe we feel very strongly about the transaction as i said in my opening remarks were very confident on the financial merits of the transaction its a wellstructured transaction were new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 very comfortable with the mortgage business we know the mortgage business but more importantly we anticipated a substantial drop and if you look at what the history of what flagstar has done from transitioning their own balance sheet theyre well along the way becoming more of a full service commercial bank theyve moved well past that of their balance sheet which is commercial banking assets so were in a path to accelerate the transformation under new leadership at nycb to combine into a very well thought out way to take a traditional model which could take a decade to transform into a much accelerated path so we truly are feel confident that this is a significant opportunity to really change the financial metrics of this company towards shareholder value with a wellrounded diversified balance sheet with a vision of a unique commercial banking model steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for that color thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from dave rochester with compass please proceed with your questions david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc tom on the deal accretion comment you made you mentioned you still see doubledigit eps accretion for the deal are you still in line with that youve been talking about previously and then if you are in line with that can you just talk about what youre assuming for that mortgage revenue and the warehouse book size youre baking into that thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so dave let me be clear im not going to give guidance for and when we put the deal together this was a doubledigit accretive deal correct the number was we dont have guidance and theres not a lot of guidance indiscernible what we see with flagstar right now thats public so when you look at the numbers on a spot basis our tangible book value is more than doubled on the accretion side to approximately we believe this is a doubledigit accretive deal we dont have public guidance but were very confident that putting these companies together without any liability reshuffling without any buybacks without any new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 financial engineering we have a very wellstructured transaction that can create good shareholder value and combine including doubledigit eps accretion but were not giving out and guidance david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay maybe just going into the deposit growth you had solid deposit growth this quarter and i know the banking as a service piece contributed to that can you maybe just size the amount of deposits at those customers that you onboarded this quarter that maybe havent yet come on to the balance sheet at this point if youre still bringing those in and then it sounds like youve got more customers that are coming in later this year can you just maybe size the pipeline of those customers that youre seeing coming in thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so look we were very cautious when we had our change of strategy about a yearandahalf ago and obviously on the loan side were being very cautious but its a lot of hard work and its a mandate its a cultural mandate and were doing great work there up since we started that initiative and i was very cautious on giving the street specificity around how much we can take from whats ours which is our deposit to our customers well its been successful thats been moving very well that is a passion at the board level all the way down to the line so thats moving very nicely for us thats how we do business going forward and on the baas side where we continue to onboard some great people especially in the ph middle where to get the onboarding efficiently our team is all geared up and we have an online pipeline thats a very unique opportunities as mentioned i mentioned were now one of the one of i think one of six banks approved one of the largest fiatbased stablecoin provider in the world thats a significant win for the company its small now but that could grow very nicely and at the same time we have a number of initiatives so i would say youre going to see continued deposit growth every quarter thats the goal im not going to tell you were going to be up billion every quarter but the good news is that as we bring in this excess liquidity and we price it accordingly we feel that we could be competitive and we have some really good talent that we brought in as part of our digital platform weve brought someone in very talented who ran million book and theres a lot of relationship opportunities out there that we think we can tap and were going to be very creative on the technology side there is a need for a bank of our size versus some of the smaller banks that are under billion that truly emphasize their capacity on indiscernible so were focusing on more funding opportunities so eventually we believe that these relationships will tie into other lines of businesses hopefully on the lending side and more importantly on the fee side so this is a strategy that were focusing on we mentioned a little bit about my banking direct my banking direct over the longterm will be our digital platform and were going to roll out a full service digital challenger bank as an alternative solution for customers and hopefully it could be a solution for the ph underserved underbanked but we have a lot of unique technology and have a strong team of new hires that are working with us to gather that business so its a focus of the bank we had some great success on the government side its been very successful we won about i think three specific deals last year and those deals will start to kick in over time and theyre both fee related and those types of transactions are zerocost deposits now a lot of the other stuff on the mortgage side is where we want to get significant benefit when you tie into what flagstar does as a business model being a substantial wholesale provider for mortgage warehouse they have tremendous relationships collectively theyre not looking for that liquidity we will come in and be the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 banking as a service partner so i think theres a real great opportunity there as a banking as a service partner for mortgage so mortgage as a service is audio gap initiative we have about billion book going into the consummation of the deal we think that number can expand dramatically they run around billion as flagstar standalone but that number can significantly increase maybe sandro can give some color on that opportunity that they dont go after right now because of the lack of desire for balance sheet purposes sandro maybe you want to add some color there alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah sure tom thank you look as you saw in the flagstar numbers our balance sheet shrunk a little bit in the first quarter principally due to the lower availableforsale balances as well as the lower warehouse balances and while theyre still substantial they are less than they were a quarter ago and so were not pursuing those opportunities that tom has referenced and i think its an opportunity thats very very significant in the billions of dollars relative to the additional deposits that can be brought in through our warehouse customers as well as our msr partners so i think thats very significant and its one of the reasons why at flagstar weve been able to adjust to a changing market you look if you look at our guidance what you see is that the model that weve been building is beginning to work and its showing that it does work in both the rising and falling interest rate market when rates were low in the last two years our mortgage business thrived and we reported record earnings and now that interest rates are rising we are seeing our nonorigination businesses really beginning to thrive as you saw in our earnings deck our margin hit a new high of in march alltime high and were guiding to that expanding to almost in q2 and with it continuing to increase throughout the year to average close to closing out the year maybe north of in december and our msr investment which has always performed in an outstanding fashion has had a much higher return in q1 particularly in march as we eased our hedges and saw a nice valuation increase so were guiding to an elevated return on our msr for the year and as you indiscernible we dont have any delinquent commercial loans so were pretty confident about the credit quality and we will be keeping an eye on expenses and keeping them in the range where they currently are so while the mortgage environment is difficult we have rightsized it and despite modest expectations for gain onsale for the year im really quite optimistic that our full year results will be very strong and q1 will play out to be a transitional quarter given that the velocity of the increased mortgage rates in the quarter was the highest in something like years and we really didnt see the benefit of the feds actions until midmarch so i think all of these things together with the liquidity opportunities that we bring to the balance sheet for an efficiently priced deposits when you put these two organizations together as tom has already suggested a couple of times we think thats really really a powerful balance sheet and opportunity for shareholder growth shareholder value growth thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hey dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 appreciate all the color thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc one thing i would add to your comment on beta risk i will tell you that in our opinion unless you have transactional deposits at zero with an elongated period of zero interest rates for so long i believe all deposit side pricing is going to rise in an aggressive fed tightening cycle so interestingly you can say things that are tied to shortterm libor indiscernible tied to indiscernible high beta risk type liabilities but ultimately as yield becomes becomes i would say that in general the feds in a tightening mode and i think all liabilities with the exception of demand deposits tied to customers and ph we call it maybe savings to a lesser extent theyre going to have high value risk in general so we assume this is going to be more of an industry phenomenon not just because were a slightly liability sensitive this is going to be in my opinion a beta risk environment and i think we will prepare for that david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that make sense maybe if i could sneak in one more i knew you have sort of all advances whats your expectation just given the current curve as to what kind of indiscernible this year i know youve got some cash there you can take some of that off do you think you can pay all that off with deposit growth in cash thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so let me give you a general view and ill let john be more specific but big picture is that in the event that ph just to put back to us were in a deposit growing initiative were in a liability gathering initiative so well have lots of flexibility and more importantly when we merge with flagstar were going to have a tremendous opportunity to really reshuffle our liability position rightsize ourselves into and so thats my broad view of what were going to do with things coming back at us and things that put back to us but if they put back we have the cash were in a great position so maybe john could add some more color to that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so depending on what happens with shortterm interest rate this quarter it is possible that well get a handful ph of portable borrowings back to us but as tom mentioned when you look at us from an interest rate risk perspective since these are quarterly indiscernible and just about all of our interest rate increasing scenarios we assume these are getting put anyway so even if you replaced it with high beta deposits from an interest rate risk perspective youd be in the same perspective and from an earnings perspective youd be a little bit better because the individual coupons that are coming on are coming on lower than where the indiscernible are coming off so it could be a benefit that we could see in the short term as these things get put back to us and the goal is to pay them off with deposits and just continue the less of a reliance on wholesale funding thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats right new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay all right thanks guys appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning tom good morning just following up on with the flagstar team i look at your deposit growth its pretty muted noninterest bearing down about yearoveryear to billion i assume some of thats mortgage related if you could just talk about whats going on there alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah its totally this is sandro its totally related to the mortgage business so as i mentioned earlier with the balance sheet declining weve left some of those servicing related deposits go escrow deposits and so forth and lower so thats its managing the size of the balance sheet or the size of the funding that we need for the balance sheet so its all planned the retail deposits consumer deposits commercial deposits are all moving in the right direction as they have historically so this is just our ability to manage the wholesale deposits in a way that fits best for the balance sheet lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yes sandro its lee if i can just jump in it is all escrow deposits obviously escrow deposits are higher when youve got a lower rate environment and theres more payoffs and as rates rise and you have lower payoffs that is you see a reduction in the escrow deposit so its all escrow deposit related brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and shifting back to the gainonsale margin to beat that horse a little bit more is this the could this be the trough or what are you seeing in your current production in terms of gross margin alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah its hard to know because as lee said in his remarks earlier everybody is adjusting capacity some companies are not going to make it were kind of where we were two years ago right not too much before covid hit and so it takes a while but if you look at our guidance were being very careful on the guidance for new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 gain on sale so even with that lower guidance when you put all of the numbers into your model i think youll see that flagstar number is still pretty darn good and as tom said consistent with what was projected a year ago when we put the transaction together although the composition of the earnings is very different because the mortgage earnings is down quite a bit and then the banking and servicing earnings are up quite a bit and again as i said earlier thats exactly how this model was intended to work on the flagstar side brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for the questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thanks brock operator thank you our next question is from steve moss with b riley securities please proceed with your thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning maybe just following up on the stablecoin partnership i hear you on your comments tom just kind of curious are those deposits going to be indexed or are they going to be noninterest bearing and should we think about those as interchangeable to what cds are scheduled to reprice and if you guys could quantify also what how many dollar value of cds scheduled to reprice thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc ill start with the a fiat thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc fiat yeah the stablecoin fiat currencies theyre usually tied to fed funds either target or effective fed funds minus some sort of a spread depending on the type so they are floating rate against fed funds but they are to a minus spread and then when you look at cds where theyre coming due we have about billion in maturing cds in the second quarter and thats at a basis point rate so yes if you think about it the gains that we have on these kinds of deposits can help offset some cd runoff if we have it steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 okay thank you thats helpful and then just on expenses here i dont think that came up with just updated guidance is that what you guys are thinking for expenses on a standalone basis thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah really no change were very very happy with the expense management and how weve been able to continue that so were flat to the first quarter is what our estimate would be for the second quarter and i think last earnings release we gave guidance for the full year were comfortable with that guidance steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great thank you very much indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah indiscernible operator thank you our next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning good morning tom the loan growth was exceptionally strong this quarter and you raised guidance in january to upper single digits im just wondering if you how youre thinking about loan growth going forward thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so its an exciting transition period given the fourth quarter was interesting given property transactions were elevated a lot of activity a lot of smart moves from borrowers to get refinanced try to get access to their capital so you saw a lot of that in q4 they continued in q1 rates are dramatically higher peter so if you think about where we are in the market were still between indiscernible fiveyear money were not really in the 10year market much at all ph and the its mostly a fiveyear product and if you look at the shape of the curve we feel very confident that our customers are going to were going to have our retention is going to be much higher i think the last month of the quarter retention was close to it was very high which is a very good turn for the company so that will transition to more growth so i think its fair to say that were looking at a highsingledigit net loan growth story for on a standalone basis excluding flagstar so thats unique since we had a very strong q1 but whats interesting about that as i just discussed on my prepared remarks we have about billion thats going to have to make a decision in the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 next months and i think the coupon and thats probably in the low so this is going to in my opinion accelerate prepayment activity well be able to hold on to more fee income there and be more resilient on ensuring that we get our economics given the rising rate environment and as customers realize that cap rates may rise a little bit here and ltvs may be more conservative as a matter of course of conservatism you probably want to access your capital sooner so it could go into a very strong for a lot of acceleration within the customer base itself at the same time theres a lot of property transactions if you look at the new york city marketplace its rich theres transactions happening and we havent seen a lot post the pandemic so it started to kick in in q4 and its continuing so were very bullish about the activity that were seeing in the multifamily space and by the way all the borrowers are very strong peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thats really helpful if i could ask about the margin i guess two questions just one john how much of the benefit in terms of the margin for the full quarter impact from the swap rolling off in the second quarter and then secondly im just wondering if you could quantify what the impact is to either the margin or net interest income for every basis point increase in rates and the deposit betas that youre assuming john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah for the on your first point the benefit of in the margin we saw from the swap rolling off this quarter was basis points so thats the billion swap that rolled off on february so we had half of the benefit in the first quarter and then the rest of the full benefit on a run rate basis this quarter were not going to give guidance on specific basis point increases we realize we are liability sensitive there are deposits a lot of the deposits that we brought in are tied to fed funds so there will be an impact as we go forward but well manage that as individual deposits come through and we bring in new relationships peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc if i could ask then maybe thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i just want to go back to johns point so think about on the big picture we have this asset sensitive institution that has will have the ph fresher liquidity opportunities and were less liability sensitive today than we were three four years ago and definitely within the last rate tightening cycle so when we take that all things being equal put that together you have a very unique opportunity to position this company into a changing interest rate environment thats going to benefit the margin going forward so thats our view when we model this this is all about putting the strength of these two companies together but when you think about the business model they have a lot of low cost funding ph over flagstar that will hold very nicely transactional type money at the same time we have this beautiful opportunity on the mortgage side where we can really be a major depository player regarding relationship opportunities so we think theres going to be a growth opportunity for liquidity and being able to really transition our balance sheet from wholesale funding and thats going to be the focus of the combined entity and the combined entity will have an asset sensitive position going into a rising rate environment new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc what could you just say what the on a combined basis what the asset sensitivity goes to john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think we put in the analyst in our first analyst report around on nii and i think its right around that level we redid it as of our last go round so yeah between and is our nii sensitivity thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats very modest deposit initiative growth on nycb standalone right john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats right thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc if you think about what weve accomplished since at the end of our core deposit franchise is up i think billion billion on the lending side so these are solid relationship deposits the goal here is to culturally change how we do business and thats the mandate and i think were making tremendous success here so ill be patient were not going to give quarterly guidance on how much loan deposits that were going to bring in every quarter but weve been successful and its been a cultural shift on how we conduct our business peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks tom thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens inc please proceed with your question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc going back to the charter discussion i was curious does the fdic have any remaining say on your charter change at the occ and is the charter change contingent upon the deal or are you going to make the switch standalone prior to or regardless of the deal close thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so im not going to say a whole lot about what can happen the reality is is that we have the dfs approval we believe that this companys position is better served as an occ charter on a combined basis and thats the direction were heading as far as commentary on what could happen what may happen the reality is that were seeking a fed charter a fed approval and an occ approval and we put out a date which is october we feel that we can meet those approval dates thats the plan weve been through this process for a year now so i think we learned as we went along here and this is the path that we believe for a national mortgage banking platform thats going to have retail locations throughout the country loa offices and a commercial banking model that would serve under the occ charter matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay the other thing is if you screen for us banks with elevated cre concentrations most often you come across institutions that are fdic and state regulated many of them are in new york but very very few are over and regulated by the occ now at yearend i think you were at and with the deal youre still north of but lower than so do you need to make any changes on this end to lower your cre concentrations ahead of the charter change thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible let me give you just a general overview and i want to kind of cite history here going back to guidance when the guidance was put out in it was very clear that well structured multifamily housing was uniquely positioned when its perceived regarding this concentration when you look at our company combined basis and you take out cooperatives which is our average ltv is and rentregulated cash flows we will be pro forma under if you take out multifamily as just a position thats not considered high risk cre were at so again we have a unique business model that has decades of zero losses in the asset class weve spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years as we look to become a ph ccorp bank going back to up to on making sure we have very strong risk management practices around cre but when you think about the business model indiscernible predominantly in multifamily rentregulated housing and we have a relatively significant cooperative portfolio with a mid20 ltvs that weve never had a nickel of loss ever as a company so these are very unique positions for history so when you take that all things being equal and look at where your true cre position would be when you carve out multifamily and cooperatives its about pro forma so i think its manageable and we have a very interesting story to tell regarding credit history matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood and then along those lines the other question they had was i was curious of your thoughts on the health of the rentregulated multifamily borrowers given limitations on rent increases from the rgb but in this new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 inflationary environment you could envision higher court expenses particularly on the energy front as we go through the year if theres minimum kind of allowed rent increases do you think theres going to be any problems there thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc matt thats a great question i will tell you that weve three years ago we focused on that obviously when we had the rent law changes indiscernible four years ago and the reality is that we look at the bronx very differently than some of the other markets and we lend differently in those markets but theres no question that as inflation outpaced revenue growth on the cash flow side you have some pressure there so what we do we do a lot of stress testing around risk management in particular weve carved out the bronxs portfolio with significant detail some of our largest players are in the bronx have significant portfolios and we believe that we have really low ltv great borrowers a history of long duration and long duration hold periods and generational holdings and we feel very confident that our asset stress testing is in very very adverse scenarios were comfortable that we have a solid portfolio but its simple math right so i have a feeling that as inflation continues to be more of a challenge for these customers there will be less ability to do a cashout refi and there have to be more accelerate to come to the table sooner so i think it was probably going to bring a lot of borrowers to the table a lot quicker just because of the potential of the squeeze and were going to be probably more conservative on ltvs but we do have a relatively low ltv portfolio especially in the rentregulated cash flow portfolio matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats a great question its definitely indiscernible great question and we appreciate that commentary because we spent a lot of time getting comfortable on the risk management side and i think thats something that weve got a good arms around it we feel really good about it and weve done a ton of work about around on the rent control area given the changes in rent laws and the nuances on how cash flows are created and its a different environment say than it was a decade ago matthew breese q analyst stephens inc the other question i had just to flip sides and go to flagstar is on page of their deck their mortgage custodial deposits is around billion i was hoping to just get a little bit of a better understanding of what those are what are those who are they from whats the anticipated beta for that book and the other thing is whats driving the volatility imbalances lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah let me indiscernible new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc go ahead go ahead sandro go ahead go ahead sandro alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah its the held for the availableforsale portfolio and the servicing portfolio has deposits associated with it and the servicing portfolio when rates are declining the payoffs are very very significant and so youre holding payoffs during the course of the month and so your escrow balances are much much higher than when youre in a rising rate environment and the prepayments are very very low so almost all of that is related to that phenomenon the beta on those so the escrow deposits carry no if we own the msr the escrow deposit carry no cost if its and connected with a subservicing arrangement then we pay the msr owner some level of deposits typically liborish and thats really it and if you look at the history of flagstar youll see that our we have the ability to manage that volatility very well because theres kind of gives and takes as youre in that higher interest rate environment prepayments are slower you have less escrow deposits but at the same time the availablefor sale portfolio is lower because originations are lower so they kind of offset each other and again theres a lot of history there that you can look at as you begin to understand flagstar better and its not a problematic volatility if you will lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah ill just jump in and sandro has hit the nail on the head think of the deposits that youre looking at on page theyre entirely related to our servicing or subservicing book so the million loans that we service or subservice some of which we own and some of which we subservice for others and to toms point when he talks about mortgage as a service we could go and get more of those deposits we just have chosen not to because we havent needed to given weve got ample deposit capacity to fund the balance sheet that we have but when we bring the two organizations together thats an area where we could go and seek additional deposit growth matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thats all i had thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible operator thank you our next question is from christopher marinac with janney please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi chris new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks hey good morning tom thank you for taking my question so youre no stranger to recessions youve seen many of your career and if we have one in the next year or two or whenever it seems that your reserves are really strong relative to any hypothetical chargeoff rate so im just curious kind of how you manage the reserve from here do you think it will grow it seems youve got a lot of leeway with the reserve and just kind of want to talk through that thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yes im going to defer to john pinto regarding the complexities around the new accounting for loan reserve so john why dont you piggyback at that one john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah theres no doubt that theres some opportunity there but we are growing the loan portfolio as well so under cecl and the life of loan estimate you got to put up those full potential life of loan losses the day you do the loan so that will offset some of that so youll have the growth in the portfolio some benefits weve seen continued benefits in the macroeconomic forecast recently even given whats been going on right now so when youre looking at where we are from a macroeconomic and our individual portfolio metrics you are very comfortable with where we are here i wouldnt say well see substantial declines or increases unless something dramatic happens in the economy but i do think that theres an ability to offset some of that growth in the portfolio in those provisions as we go forward as long as the macroeconomic indicators stay relatively consistent with where they are today indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i would say historically the company has a very conservative view of an inplace cash flow lender our focus has been of conservatism and historically if you look at the statistics you can run this out years close to years we have very little losses based on actual experience so were very confident on how we lend culturally and thats not changing if anything in a recessionary environment well just be more conservative and i think thats important for customers to understand as they start to significantly rise if were heading into a recession and the rates starting to rise and ultimately these lower coupons have to refinance there may be less money to take out based on what the value theyve created over the past five to seven years so its ph not an accelerant and when they come to the table the cash flow is going to be the net cash flow to them given the carry cost is lower so youre giving less dollars and its almost an incentive for them to come to the table sooner before cap rates follow interest rate increases at the same time we have a history here we were an inplace cash flow lender we dont look at what the future is going to hold for property transactions whats in place and thats our conservative outlook as being a cash flow ph lender for portfolio new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great tom thank you and thank you john as well appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc ebrahim youre back ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey thanks for squeezing me in i know weve gone over time just a very quick question maybe for john the tangible book value accretion you mentioned whats driving that is it just purely based on the interest rate mark today versus when you announced the deal thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible tangible book value creation on the transaction john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah that were using the guidance that tom gave has got an estimate of where the mark would be as of the march 31st so that does move around no doubt right so that could change but thats a really an allinclusive number is what we are where we expecting to come out if you look at where we were at the beginning when we announced the transaction we would add a pretty significantly higher credit mark on the portfolio and just look at the allowance that the cecl results that flagstar had when we announced the deal compared to now and then that of course will be offset by our rate mark so well have a much higher rate mark on the portfolio and a much lower credit mark on the portfolio when youre looking at loans thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think obviously ph in just valuation perspective when you put the deal together on accounting perspective youve got negative goodwill i would imagine john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah its a bargain purchase indiscernible new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc this transaction given the current landscape that could obviously change as we get closer to closing but if you look at the past year flagstar had a tremendous economically so that goes into the capital indiscernible and when you reset the transaction on an accounting perspective we have a lot more capital there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one followup go ahead john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc go ahead john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah no go ahead i was just going to say youre right it is dependent on where the final marks come out no doubt ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc okay and just one final question tom any risk to the dividend as you go through the occ process to get the deal approved i know indiscernible fine youre going to have excess capital but just would love to hear in terms of your confidence in the dividend sustainability thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc were very confident in our position to return value back to shareholders and our priority is to continue maintaining our current dividend position and obviously when we model this the payout ratio based on the pro formas comes down significantly so we still believe that thats the case and our focus is to continue maintaining our dividend and were going to hold to that assumption operator thank you there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments thomas robert cangemi chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank
