desired loan risk profile with the ongoing investments weve made in our credit systems and expansion of our risk analytics we can make strategic datadriven decisions to better manage and mitigate risk in the book furthermore our bankers remain in close contact with our customers to understand the challenges and headwinds they face allowing us to identify signs of stress resulting from ongoing elevated inflation rising interest rates and the standing labor supply chain and energyrelated challenges across various industries and markets these factors are carefully analyzed and addressed in underwriting as macroeconomic and marketspecific conditions continue to evolve with our core credit philosophy remaining front and center in closing we are very pleased with the continued strength

assets to billion at period end investment securities totaled billion with a fairly even split between afs and hcm during the quarter we largely reinvested our securities cash flows which was around million per month while staying in the to duration area periodend total loans increased million linkedquarter or annualized including an increase of million in consumer loans and million in commercial loans and leases commercial loans saw another quarter of healthy production with yeartodate activity higher than the same period in with such strong production the 90day pipeline has softened a bit relative to last quarter consumer loan growth was driven by strong organic residential mortgage activity across our footprint with particularly strong growth in the carolinas and midatlantic regions the physicians first mortgage program accounted for million or with the increase in the mortgage balance on a linkedquarter basis indirect lending increased linkedquarter as we saw more seasonal activity in that space as well as an increased supply of vehicles indirect book is predominantly higher quality prime paper total deposits ended the quarter at billion an increase of million linkedquarter or annualized the deposit mix continues to be favorable with noninterestbearing deposits comprising of total deposits at quarter end longterm debt increased million following the august issuance of million in three year senior notes we plan to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes which excludes the extinguishment of debt on the income statement net interest income totaled a record million an increase of million or reflecting growth in average earning assets and benefits from the higher interest rate environment as our net interest margin increased basis points to managing deposit costs continues to be an ongoing focus while the costs of interestbearing deposits increased basis points from last quarter they remained fairly low at basis points in terms of deposit betas yearto date we have a cumulative beta of on total deposits as the fed continues to increase rates this creates competitive pressure on deposit pricing and we are currently anticipating our deposit costs will increase in the fourth quarter bringing the total cumulative deposit beta to around turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million a slight increase from last quarter capital markets income increased linkedquarter to a total of million with solid contributions from syndications international banking and swap fees service charges increased million linkedquarter largely due to growth in treasury management services interchange fees and higher customer activity mortgage banking operations income decreased to million and sold mortgage lines declined million or as consumer preferences shifted to adjustable rate mortgages we are holding on balance sheet on an operating basis noninterest expense increased million or compared to the prior quarter excluding mergerrelated expenses of million and million in the third and second quarters of respectively salaries and employee benefits increased million reflecting reduced vacancy rates and higher production and performancerelated incentives marketing decreased million due to the timing of digital advertising and campaigns for our physicians first program in the

transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 tangible book value per common share was at september a decrease of per share from june this change reflected the impact of aoci reducing the current quarters tangible book value per share by compared to at the end of the prior quarter which was largely mitigated by the higher level of earnings for the quarter the increased unrealized losses in the afs portfolio due to rising interest rates will accrete back into capital over time and securities mature or prepay lastly as vince mentioned we are expecting the ub bancorp acquisition to close and convert in december of this year their balance sheet continues to trend within our expectations and we are excited to add their low cost deposit base in a higher rate environment now lets turn to guidance which excludes the announced ub bancorp acquisition we increased our fullyear guidance for loans to midteens growth with underlying organic growth in the highsingle to lowdouble digits on a yearoveryear spot basis total deposits are projected to grow mid to highsingle digits on a yearoveryear spot basis fullyear net interest income is expected to be between billion and billion with the fourth quarter between million to million our guidance currently assumes basis points of rate increases for the fourth quarter we are increasing noninterest income to be between million and million with the fourth quarter in the mid to high70 million area the revised fullyear noninterest income guidance is due to higherthanprojected third quarter income fullyear guidance for noninterest expense was only revised to provide a tighter range of million to million on an operating basis while maintaining our previous guide of million to million for the fourth quarter this does not include the onetime expenses associated with acquisitions and branch consolidations fullyear provision guidance was also revised to a tighter range of million to million which does not include the initial million of provision related to howard and is dependent on net loan growth and macroeconomic factors during the fourth quarter lastly the effective tax rate should be between and for the fourth quarter which does not assume any investment tax credit activity in the quarter with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince we are pleased with this quarters record revenue and earnings per share as well as our loan and deposit growth and our current level of noninterest bearing deposits our asset quality continues to perform favorably with a low delinquency rate of basis points and only basis points of net chargeoffs we continue to stay focused on changes to the economic environment and remain confident in our ability to manage through potentially challenging macroeconomic conditions our fnb employees have performed admirably throughout uncertain times and i know that they will remain dedicated to fulfilling our commitment to all of our stakeholders to them i extend my sincere gratitude at their collective efforts for what drives our performance and i look forward to working alongside our dedicated team as we close out fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen with that well begin our question and answer session operator instructions our first question today comes from jared shaw from wells fargo securities please go ahead with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe just starting on asset sensitivity and the outlook for the as we go into any thoughts on starting to moderate that asset sensitivity with the ub deal coming on like you said thats going to add even more dda how should we be thinking about what youre doing in terms of portfolio decisions to potentially look at falling rates as we build out our models here vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would tell you a couple of things jared i mean over the course of with various strategies which is our exposure to downside rates as you look ahead from here weve reduced our cash position added massive duration in the loan side through mortgage and securities books plus weve executed about billion or so and received fixed swaps to protect us on the downside and in the midst of kind of looking at potential other opportunities to put some more derivatives on potentially to protect us from downside movement in rates next year thats expected so its happened organically outside of that billion and i think the way were positioned today theres still a good amount of benefit to come from the expected movement in rates as we get into the fourth quarter and then into next year and well capture that obviously in the guidance for but theres still upside to the margin and to the net interest income as you look into the fourth quarter for sure given the overall asset sensitive position of the balance sheet and i would just say again too that over time weve kind of foregone some shortterm earnings to kind of position the balance sheet so that we would get that benefit from rising rates when it ultimately did come weve stayed short in our investment portfolio we have consistently had a split between afs and hcm which helps on the aoci impacts that everybodys experiencing right now so i think some of those tactics that weve taken in the past and strategies are benefiting as we sit here today and as we look ahead from here fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks so then on the deposits great beta performance this quarter could you give us an update anything that we should think about with the deposit growth this quarter is there any seasonality there that could roll off what were spot rates at the end of the quarter and as we look forward what do you think the through thecycle beta could be on the overall blended deposit base with ub there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a couple of things i mean we do have seasonality in our municipal business that we have every year and kind of swings i say to million to million as you go kind of from peak to trough and go through the year and that still builds through october into november so that kind of normal seasonality is there but on top of that we continue to have good success adding new accounts on the retail side as well as on the commercial side with the markets were in we continue to win not just lending side but also bringing in the operating accounts so thats clearly a benefit to the overall deposit growth that weve consistently had and our ddas continuing to build over time theres been a focus theres a new slide that we added if you look back in forward from up to and its been continuously moving up its a big focus in the company for sure as far as the betas i mean the liquidity to banking system is still there we still have billion in excess cash on our balance sheet as like others were starting to see more pressure on deposit rates as the fed continues to move at this point theres been very limited movement of our retail deposit rates but definitely more frequent conversations with the municipal business clients where weve been making adjustments particularly for those that have core relationship with us we have not lost any clients which is important i think the commercial customers the municipal customers having conversations with us arent just closing accounts and moving somewhere else so i think it speaks to the relationships that people have built up over time as you know we have a new slide that we added in there i mean so far cumulative beta for total deposits was at at the end of september our forecast is to be around for total deposits at the end of the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then i guess just finally for me on the expense side as we look into any more update on sort of the pace of hiring in the dc northern virginia area is that going to be an area of continued growth and then potentially even richmond with that hiring you did down there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean our hiring in dc has been underway so we dont expect a particular indiscernible in that area there are several retail locations that are coming online so it could be a little bit of an expense pickup but its not significant relative to the total base when you look at expenses overall weve been engaged in a multiyear expense takeout exercise so we targeted certain levels and then we achieved them and we did it repeatedly over the last three years fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 we expect to continue to stay focused on it there is some opportunity within our expense base to continue to manage expenses down in the face of inflation so we can offset some of the natural increases that were going to see i think from an occupancy or a vacancy perspective vacancy has been reasonable for us the culture at the company is such that i think our employees are genuinely happy and are committed to the company weve taken some actions to increase salaries here and there and continue to take care of the employees as we move along so we werent caught off guard if you recall we had significant increases in the retail space over the last five years or so in salary expenses to retain those people and with commercial banking and a few upgrades that we reassessed throughout time so our vacancy rate has been within historical ranges it on the upper end but its been within historical ranges so not really an outlier but i hope that helps we didnt give guidance for next year on expenses ill turn it back over to vince if you want to add something vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no i would just add to vinces this point over the last four years including this year we had million of cost savings that weve realized its always a focus every year as far as coming up with what that target should be and it really comes out of just continuing to renegotiate with vendors optimizing space throughout the footprint as well as a variety of process improvement initiatives that is just kind of ongoing so weve always had that disciplined focus and well continue to have that and as you can see from the guidance this year that it has been consistent is that million to million and managing expenses within that band and that will continue to be a focus for us and creates the positive operating leverage thats in the double digits that we were able to generate this quarter that we expect will continue to be at very good levels in coming quarters here jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for taking the questions vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure thank you operator our next question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks guys good morning maybe just vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc following up on the margin discussion i know you gave a lot of color on deposit betas and expectations there but if i could just get your thoughts i guess on maybe where the margin may peak in relation to when we get the last rate hikes and kind of your thoughts around what happens once we get the peak margin if we get a decline or stabilization or maybe another floating up thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just say that as i commented on minutes ago i mean theres still upside in the margin from here with the continued fed actions i think our team has across the board done a very nice job managing the deposit costs on the retail and the commercial and the municipal side so thats very much a focus for us given the excess cash we have on the balance sheet and just kind of operating the company we have a very active process every week through our pricing committee that kind of optimize where those rates should be so i mean when we give guidance for next year obviously well give you kind of a outlook for the full year as well as to quarterly half but i think theres still upside definitely more upside from here on the margin and net interest income and then as i said earlier weve taken some action to protect us for when rates do come down so theres still plenty of upside but put some protection in place to help with that when it happens and none of us know for sure exactly when thats going to happen and i should comment too that the guidance has an additional basis points in rate hikes as we mentioned on that slide in the fourth quarter thats whats kind of baked into our outlook daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay shifting gears here then over to credit quality obviously thats been really strong for you so far things looking very clean in the numbers your comments very positive based on whats available now but where are you kind of most concerned or looking at most closely in terms of the loan books given what were expecting here going into the next cycle gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey daniel one of the focuses of our team today is on the economically sensitive areas and we feel that those are the small business portfolio as well as the indirect portfolio on the consumer side those books of business have continued to perform really well delinquency flat quarteroverquarter in both of them chargeoffs did tick up a little bit with used car prices coming down in the indirect book as expected but those are the areas of focus at the moment and like i said were pleased with how theyve held up to this point and expect them to perform well even though there are headwinds in those areas vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania weve also been underlining weve been stressing interest rate sensitivity right gary within the commercial real estate portfolio so fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and across the ci book as well i mean were pretty aggressive with our interest rate stresses i mean were underwriting cre transactions today at north of and then were stressing it from there so weve got some pretty heavy stresses built into the front side of the underwriting equation and the oversight management of the book and the stresses that we place on those portfolios vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and weve said this before on other calls i mean gary stated it in the prepared comments we manage credit risk consistently through cycles we dont go crazy during the good times and loosen structure and we dont tighten in a crazy way during the bad times and for conservative underwriting upfront better ltvs if you look at the consumer book the credit scores and the ltvs are very solid id say in most cases gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean the average there is in the high vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so basically what that does is it protects your downside as you move through the cycle and when others are returning capital and shrinking their balance sheet it gives us an opportunity to selectively grow our balance sheet and that happens throughout the last cycle we reported multiple quarters of loan growth when the industry was shrinking and our credit performance was pretty darn good so im very confident in our team i know we have theres a lot of uncertainty moving forward were not naïve to it we monitor portfolios prospectively we do all kinds of things from an analytics perspective and stressing perspective and were very active at grading our credits accurately and quickly so what youre seeing from us is its close to realtime as we can get it i think things are pretty good today were looking forward and garys team is being very cautious as we move forward daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific i appreciate all that color and then kind of just a related followup on reserves how much would you say the qualitative side is impacting the level of where you are right now in reserves just kind of thinking through how changes in macro forecast could impact reserves going forward thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the qualitative piece of the reserve today daniel is right at about we would expect that to move down slightly as we go forward and some of the other quantitative models take effect during the quarter as i mentioned in the remarks the loan growth naturally took some provision expense a pretty good chunk of it we did see slower prepayment speeds which are naturally extending the lives of some of those portfolios and naturally the impact provision there from a cecl standpoint fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 our economic forecasts have seen some softening these are quantitative models in our models around cre and housing variables so that did take a little bit of provision expense as well that all said those builds were on that side of the equation were primarily offset by improvements in credit quality which ultimately drew the reserve down basis point at as mentioned all told credit quality continues to be a driver there and loan growth is going to drive the provision going forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania our reserve position relative to our peer group is still very positive very favorable and i attribute that to gradation staying on top of the credits making sure were understanding where we are from a risk perspective and a gradation standpoint i dont know if gary you want to gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i would agree with that i mean we viewed the pandemic as not something that was finite and totally ending so we were a little cautious around that and i go back to a yearandahalf back when we were really starting to get worried about the inflationary signs that we were seeing back in early2021 and we felt that it was appropriate to be prudent with the reserve as opposed to releasing large chunks of it so we managed it i think appropriately and accordingly and were pleased with the strength of it today daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color thanks for all that thats all for me i appreciate it vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator our next question comes from casey haire from jefferies please go ahead with your question casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 a question for vince c so the noninterest bearing deposit mix has been very strong just wondering how is that level sustainable from here or are you factoring in some attrition as you in your cum beta through the end of the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania casey this is vince delie we focused on that historically to grow that position i mean if you go back and i think if you look at the chart within the deck you can see the deposit mix has shifted very favorably thats been an effort a multiyear effort that type of these changes are built into our dda i mean basically have incented people to focus more on low cost deposit gathering they work pretty diligently strategically to secure treasury management relationships so that were hoping is sticky have said that i mean im sure as you move forward in a rising rate environment theres pressure on noninterestbearing deposits so its reflected in the deposit beta side that we gave right vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont know if you have any other detail you want to break down i guess vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i dont casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and then vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania look a very solid the other thing i will add casey is our small acquisition is also additive because their our deposit mix is also favorable its even higher percentage of demand deposit is higher than ours so i guess right 40ish vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania that announcement yeah its vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so its going to be additive from that standpoint as we move into a period of elevated rates fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and then on the cash position i think you mentioned an excess cash of billion what is sort of like the bare minimum that you want to run at just a reminder there so we get a sense as to as when that does run low youre a little bit more like the use of wholesale borrowings becomes more prevalent vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania casey thats really what we would consider excess cash that billion we have a certain core level of cash on the balance sheet that you would typically see but that billion that i referenced is truly the excess cash so that can go down to zero casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay all right so decent cushion from here and then just lastly on the loan pipeline obviously a strong result here it sounds like the pipeline is a little bit softer just wondering if theres any a little more color on any verticals or is it just below the lighter after a strong production quarter and then also the indirect auto has had a very nice growth over the last two quarters is that seasonal in nature or is that going to slow down or is that momentum going to continue vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well ill answer the question the first question about the overall pipeline ill let gary talk about indirect auto because it reports up through gary but the pipelines in general they were current robust leading into the last two quarters actually and weve been able to product some pretty significant loan growth as we close out those transaction the pipeline has interacted which is pretty natural were at a point in the cycle where you typically dont see a surge in commercial borrowing requests its seasonal period basically and from a cyclical perspective i wouldnt expect to see a surge in demand particularly in the ci book as we move towards the end of the year i think those pipelines will refill i mean theyre not terribly low they were theyre at a decent level theyve just been reduced because of all the stuff we closed in the 90day bucket so my hope is that were able to go out given the size of our footprint the fact that we have fairly significant share across seven states and the district of columbia i would expect us to be able to go out and continue to generate high quality earning assets that goes for both consumer and commercial and i know that our regional presidents while they face a very significant amount of competition quarter after quarter theyre very optimistic about their ability to execute in the market that theyre in gary i dont know do you want to comment on indirect auto gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah sure vince thanks the second and third quarters casey are our seasonally high periods for us so we do normally see that type of spike in volume during the middle part of the year weve really been focused over the last month month and a half a couple months on enhancing our margins in that business i would expect as we move through q4 here that well see lower volumes there at the end were focused as always on high quality paper so i would expect that to seasonally dip for those couple of reasons as well as our focus on enhancing those margins fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and just sorry one last one housekeeping question the tax rate guide is up a little bit to is this the level we should assume carrying into vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania it will always be dependent on the level of investment tax credit activity that we execute and well continue to be active on those types of transactions but what we see in a activity in the fourth quarter so thats why were in what i would say is a normalized to absent those types of transactions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the to with a benefit provided that theres some taxes in transactions vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we expect theres something we had teed up in the fourth quarter that we expect to happen next year so that will create some benefit to that tax rate but pretty clean rate casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thanks casey vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you casey gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator our next question comes from michael perito from kbw

structure the type the use case just a little bit of a refresher as its clearly seen some nice growth recently for you guys just wondering if you could give us a rundown of kind of how that product works generally vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well we started with a mortgage product that had a more advantageous ltv basically just the basic premise of it for physicians medical professionals doctors that are starting out typically or loaded with student loan debt so we made some adjustments to the underwriting of loan debt product to assist the physicians in securing their homes we migrated it from a purely physical origination process to a digital origination process and we bundle a series of other products medical practice loan which is a small business loan the student loan refinance product with the depository product and then the first mortgage product and we call that our physicians first bundle and its on our digital estore which is our ecommerce website that we set up and i referenced it in the prepared comments and then we use that platform with our originators to go after physicians globally and that portfolio has performed extraordinarily well over time its grown nicely gary i dont know you might comment on some of the credit gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean the delinquencies in that portfolio were very near zero high fico scores very solid debt to income ratios i mean its a highquality book of business and we continue to see good opportunities there the bundling of the programs and the opportunities in a small business practice lending business i think are ahead of us as well as some of the student loan ph refi opportunities there so we expect that to continue to bear fruit as we move forward with that program vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania because thats michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and competitively do you guys sorry go ahead vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania no go ahead go ahead ask your question fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i was going to say competitively do you guys feel like that there is a little bit of an edge you guys have here or a lot of other banks in this space are focused on this niche or is there room for you guys if you kind of take some market share vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well there are other banks focused on this niche i mean just about every competitor we have offers a similar mortgage product the difference is the way weve organized our approach to gathering those clients we use data analytics we use our digital tools the estore like we said in our prepared comments we had customers visit our site so weve created traffic on our website which translates into the ability to promote certain product and services and then when we engage in digital advertising and traditional advertising methodology we can direct them to our portal so when you look at it the physicians first estore page for example it grew to visits per month from zero so we just stood that up not that long ago a couple of quarters ago so that supported the growth yearoveryear of in that category in terms of views on that site and it supports the overall views so when we use that tool that digital tool were creating traffic that enables customers to look for solutions and then were applying in some instances our analytics tools to present products to customers as they visit the site so they put the physicians first package the mortgage package in the shopping cart and then the other items pop up and id say people that purchase this product typically look at these other products so its led to more views and ease of marketing and a higher visibility right so were attributing some of our success to obviously the people matter most but some of our success is directly attributable to our digital strategy and the estore concept that weve developed michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it helpful thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hope that helps michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah no it is very thorough and then vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i mean physicians a month now look at our website just to keep that in perspective i mean thats physicians we wouldnt normally see most likely so it helps build awareness and michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania supports our brand michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then just lastly and unrelated just on the capital markets fees which were pretty solid in the quarter is it reasonable to think that in the current environment theres room for that to kind of continue to be elevated with rates moving and some of the economic uncertainty and everything are you seeing a little extra engagement from the commercial side there or just a level of extra color there if you dont mind vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its a great question i mean i think were a little bit of an anomaly because we have a pretty broad offering for our size so we have a debt capital markets group that participates in bond economics they support our large corporate calling activity or large corporate bankers we have syndications effort thats outsized i think for a bank our size in fact our syndications revenue has doubled right vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania more than double yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania more than double over the last year so its a sizable contributor we do hedging we throw international into the mix because we do some hedging for international clients thats grown nicely the derivatives business is a core business for the company thats more volatile because of the changes in interest rates and demand from a loan perspective that both impacts that area but we have a very strong team and have had great success structuring products for clients to protect them in both up and down interest rate cycles so sure i mean im bullish on our capital markets platform in general over the long term i believe there is significant upside over the long term in the short run youre going to see variability its lumpy because of the changes in rates but vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i think capital markets is very early vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah debt capital markets is early syndications is theres still upside there even though we performed extraordinarily well this year theres upside theres always an opportunity in the debt capital markets area because of the activity that goes on with our larger borrowers in terms of the issuance of debt bonds not bank debt where were out of debt but bond debt fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 and then as weve grown as a company our credit appetite in terms of forward position is growing and in order for us to compete more effectively against larger competitors and to hold our own against some of the regional players that we compete with dayin and dayout we built out our syndications capability we have very strong corporate bank there are terrific corporate bankers across the company ive been in the business for years i can tell you we have competed against everybody over the last three decades we have a very strong team so their knowledge and capability will lead to growth in capital markets the stronger your bankers are the more opportunities you have in that space and thats why over the long haul im very optimistic about that area barring economic headwinds michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah it makes sense its good to see the momentum this year thank you guys for taking my question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from brandon king from truist securities please go ahead with your question brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yes so i just had one question really on loan yields i was just curious what the loan yield was for new loans in the month of this month of october and also wanted to know if you can give us color on what youre seeing from a loan spread dynamic are you seeing more competitive pressures or are you actually seeing the expansion in loan spreads given kind of what youve been able to price out there in the market vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i can comment on indiscernible and then maybe ask gary or vince to comment on the spreads for current loans yeah the new loans made during the third quarter came on at a yield of which was up significantly from in the second quarter and if you look at kind of the overall spot portfolio rate it increased basis points to after increasing basis points in the second quarter of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 so the new rates the way theyre coming on as you would expect significantly higher which bodes well for my comments earlier about kind of the margin as you get into the fourth quarter and continue to build on the net interest income there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania in terms of the spreads we are seeing them strengthen so were seeing some benefit pretty much across the board highquality paper is naturally bringing very very low rates in terms of the strength of investmentgrade credits but that has also moved up so i would tell you that everythings up basis points upwards of basis points from a spread standpoint depending upon asset class vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah were not a yield chaser by the way we focus principally on credit quality so we like to do even though some transactions may be more thinly priced the ability to produce results through cycles is directly hinged on how creditworthy those borrowers are going in so while we try to benefit from higher yields in certain asset classes across a broader spectrum of lending so we have a portfolio as of late gary many of the ci credits that we brought in were larger right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and more creditworthy and the credit spreads on those deals are thinner so anyway just thought id bring that up thats in the ci book in the consumer book again we tend to chase higherquality borrowers but thats going to impact your overall credit spreads and our perception of spreads in other words were not out there doing highrisk private equity deals with significant leverage right thats where youll find the best yield thats not in our portfolio brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and brandon just a further comment to your question so the that i mentioned thats the rate for new loans for the entire third quarter if we look at the month of september loans came on at a relative to the average for the quarter so to kind of be responsive to your question about kind of more current so thats where we ended the quarter for the month of september brandon king q analyst truist securities inc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 got it got it thanks for taking my question vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator our next question comes from manuel navas from da davidson company please go ahead with your question manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning i think most of my questions have been answered but just can you describe any differences youre seeing in terms of loan pricing or deposit pricing just regionally you talked a little bit about loan growth cleveland being pretty strong but just kind of can you continue that with loans and deposits just in terms of pricing competition vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah were in some pretty intense markets our core markets are actually extraordinarily competitive people think its the opposite but cleveland pittsburgh and even baltimore are very competitive markets i mean cleveland has always been a tougher market to price in as you move into the southeast while there are more competitors there tends to be more activity so it kind of buffers the competitive environment slightly but if you looked overall the variations are not that great but there are variations so i just pointed them out but i think and that goes for both loans and deposits and as you look at the state of pennsylvania where we compete as you move across the state into philadelphia credit spreads tend to narrow as you get closer to philadelphia because it is more competitive and even more competitive in that area so once you cross into the central pa into the philadelphia market the commercial pricing becomes a little thinner from a depository perspective its the same type of thing but were really focused as a company on gathering demand deposits this is a very strong deposit franchise its evident in the results you can see it in the trend that weve presented our objective here is to be the principal operating bank for our clients were not out buying deposits to fund our operations so what that means is the commercial bankers are out theyre selling treasury management services were getting the principal disbursement accounts so we have balances that are typically used to pay for services or are sitting for liquidity purposes for the company and demand deposit accounts fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 and then on the consumer side we strive to be the principal bank for the consumer so thats how youre able to maintain pricing and produce better betas and all the things that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania leveraging your beta signs and vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania lead generation all of those things vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania its all tied together anyway i hope that answers your question manuel navas q analyst d a davidson co no i appreciate that thank you very much operator and our next question comes from brian martin from janney montgomery please go ahead with your question brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question maybe just one followup on the vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc loan yields i think vince you said it was a yield in the month of september can you i guess give a little bit of color on just the commercial yields outside of whether its for the quarter or just for the month on where new production is coming on vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont have that handy that level granularity fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i can tell you i dont think we have that at our fingertips but when you look at the deals that are coming in typically a middle market commercial deal is anywhere from to in credit spread brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania you know what brian thats been fairly consistent so if you want to convert that to a fixed rate yield you have to look at the yield curve the we focus on credit spreads in that space and kind of manage the groups that way versus looking at an outright yield they may look at fixed rate loan they do a variable adjustable rate loan so were kind of keying in on that credit spread but that i would say credit spreads have broadened slightly across the board i dont know what you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i mean theyre up like i said to basis points in some asset brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then that new origination the reason its difficult to put your finger on what the yields would be in the commercial book is because we run the broad spectrum of market from small business up to large corporate so if we book a large corporate deal at libor plus a or thats your spread right so its going to reduce the yield in that quarter but we look at it more broadly from a portfolio perspective than try to manage it that way and that helps us manage it as well brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i cant give you any more than that i hope that helps you but were expecting credit spreads to continue to broaden as we move through a more difficult period in the cycle brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 got you no thats helpful and then maybe just the reinvestment rates for securities today where are they at i guess for the quarter for september just kind of how youre thinking about next quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say just to make a few comments on that the reinvestment rates averaged for the quarter for the third quarter it was up from last quarter and in the first quarter as we know if rates havent moved up so the compares to a roll off rate of so that kind of gives you a reference point there the duration of what weve invested on during the quarter was still in that kind of level if we look at where were investing today we continue to take advantage of the market yields weve been investing at about as we sit here so far in october with the duration just a little bit south of brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay no thats helpful all right perfect and then just how about maybe just one for gary on the commercial real estate concentration levels just is there any areas you guys are staying away from lending today just given maybe an increased focus here from the regulatory side on commercial real estate or just any thoughts on if youre staying away from anything today and just kind of where the current concentration levels are gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah weve been extremely cautious for i would say the last yearandahalf a couple of years and beyond even in the retail space so were doing very little volume around retail cre we do occasionally come across a very strong transaction with longterm leases credit tenants and those type of underwritings and well continue to pick our spots there the other space is the office space overly cautious there i mean its been a space that we identified very early on in the pandemic as one thats going to have an elongated tail around potential risk in that space so again similar as the retail well find the odd transaction that is longterm lease to an extremely strong credit type of tenant and well move forward with a transaction like that but very very little volume vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we have very little hospitality the portfolio is tiny gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the hospitality i mean we dont we havent made a hospitality loan in five six years vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont think in all of my time in banking i would this portfolio as it sits is in a very good position moving into the cycle that were in and i give that credit to gary and his team theyve been obviously you want to grow the book you want to grow revenue but when were in choppy waters like this this is one of the best places to be right youve addressed risk within the portfolio were very conservative fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 what gary didnt say is we dont have a lot of urban large office buildings we dont we have office buildings but theyre largely smaller suburban buildings we havent experienced the same level of vacancy so i think that were very wellpositioned obviously everybody is going to be facing in the industry a slowdown next year if that occurs and if we perform the way we have through other cycles we will be in really good shape so i think we have the same team so hopefully were able to manage through this more effectively and outperform others brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont know thank you i dont know if you have any other questions brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no i think that answers most about the real estate type just the last two just general questions just on the your outlook on the loan growth side i know youre not giving much outlook for but just are you seeing more caution it sounds like youre seeing more caution among the commercial customers obviously based on where we are in the cycle and just economically but is that how we should think about at least as we look at thats probably what we would expect as you get a little bit deeper this quarter and share more next quarter but is that kind of a trend youre seeing among the customers today on the commercial side vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think the clients you got to remember weve all gone through a pretty significant turbulent time with the pandemic its pretty shocking to a lot of people our client so i think that theyre thinking about things more conservatively as we move into this cycle obviously the economic headwinds are real inflation is real the supply chain disruption is real i think our commercial customer base appears to be pretty realistic about revenue expectations moving into next year which ultimately translates into fixed charge coverage and performance on our loans so im hopeful that on the commercial side the customer base that we have were relying on those management teams to get us through just like we our shareholders rely on us to get them through so i think we have a very strong customer base we have very prudent customers they think about their business they manage leverage appropriately and thatll get them through a difficult time on the consumer side the consumers appear to be in pretty good shape i mean theres obviously stressors out there from an economic perspective but globally when we look at the performance of the portfolio the delinquency rate is low the chargeoff rates are low i know those are lagging indicators and then if we look at cash positions within the consumer segment themselves they appear to still be fairly healthy even though we dont expect that to deplete over time with inflation but i with inflationary pressure and other things but i think were in a very good position moving in to this next cycle and were very cautious so i dont know how else to leave it so i may come across that way is because we are cautious in terms of pipelines we manage our pipelines fairly rigorously we do credit reviews upfront so thats really going to be contingent upon whats going on from an economic perspective and over time how other capital fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 providers are impacted so kind of tough to predict where the pipelines are going to go but i feel pretty good about where we are today and the pipelines are have softened but a lot of it has to do with transitioning deal flow and theyre still at reasonable levels heading into next year so well see what happens gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania and just an additional note brian just this within the last week ive been pulled into three new transactions and all of them extremely strong so the pipelines can build rather quickly based on some of the transactions that were able to look at these days and i was very pleased with those three discussions and theyre all moving forward brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you no thats helpful and just the last one for me was just on capital just any changes in the outlook just kind of where the maybe where the capital levels ended in fourth quarter just post the union deal and just how youre thinking about the buyback and just managing the capital levels today vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no change in our strategy there we continue to target cet1 ratio around the estimated for this quarter is up to as you saw on the slides the strong earnings more than supported the asset growth for the quarter and the dividend payout ratio is at a very attractive level we would expect to build cet1 ratio to in the nearterm and then gradually build that ratio in just given kind of higher earnings generation levels we can benefit from the asset sensitive positioning regarding the buybacks its still the same philosophy brian i mean our first and best use of capital is organic loan growth so the level of buybacks will be dependent on that we did not buyback any shares this quarter but we will be opportunistic as we go forward given we still think theres significant value in our relative pe to the peers we made outperform the peer significantly in recent periods and we think theres still room for that pe we need to expand relative to the peers so we will be opportunistic but the overall philosophy is still the same brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and i dont know if someone asked earlier but just you talked about the positive operating leverage i mean with the efficiency ratio being below today is that kind of an achievable is that kind of a sustainable level kind of given the outlook for what youre seeing with margins still trending higher here as you kind of look over the next couple of quarters vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would just say i mean for the fourth quarter i will give guidance in january for next year as i mentioned theres still upside in the net interest income its baked into our guidance and well continue to manage expenses diligently as we always have theres still theres upside to that ratio or improvements to that ratio into the next quarter and then next year well cover that into guidance indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay thank you for taking the questions guys vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen with that weve reached the end of todays questionandanswer session and at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to vince delie for
