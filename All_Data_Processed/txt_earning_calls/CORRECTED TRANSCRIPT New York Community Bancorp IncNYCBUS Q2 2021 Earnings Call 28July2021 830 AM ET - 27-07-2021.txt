also joining on the line from flagstar bancorp are sandro dinello president and ceo of flagstar and lee smith president of flagstar mortgage as you may have already seen flagstar reported strong second quarter results today we also announced better thanexpected results for the second quarter of the year this is the second consecutive quarter of betterthan expected quarterly results im very happy with our strong operating performance this quarter which was highlighted by continued expansion in our net interest margin lower operating expenses good loan growth solid credit quality and most importantly a substantial improvement in our earnings per share in fact this is the companys best quarterly operating performance in over years when we reported eps of back in the first quarter of on a nongaap basis excluding mostly merger related nonrecurring items of million diluted earnings per share were up yearoveryear and or ahead of consensus estimates while diluted earnings per share were a share up on a yearoveryear basis as for the details of the quarter starting with our net interest margin our second quarter margin was up basis points sequentially prepayment income was very strong during the second quarter increasing to million compared to the first quarter of the year and added basis points to the margin compared to basis points in the previous quarter excluding prepayment income and the impact on holding excess liquidity during the quarter the net interest margin increased basis points to compared to the prior quarter ahead of our expectations our preprovision net revenue was also strong during the current second quarter excluding mergerrelated expenses of million ppnr totaled million up a very solid yearoveryear new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 another highlight of the quarter was our efficiency ratio which improved to compared to during the previous quarter total operating expenses decreased million or compared to the previous quarter which was also better than what we anticipated moving onto deposits total deposits at june were billion relatively unchanged on a linked quarter basis however this masks the significant progress we are making on our deposit growth strategy since the beginning of the year if you look at the average deposits theyve increased billion or compared to march 31st this was primarily driven by deposits garnered from our relationship with our technology partnerships which increased to over billion during the quarter before settling back to billion since being named ceo it has been one of my top initiatives to bring in more core deposits from our multifamily and commercial real estate borrowers these initiatives are beginning to bear fruit as loan related deposits at june 30th increased million at annualized to billion compared to december balances as a result of these initiatives cds as a percentage of total deposits have declined to as of the current second quarter compared to in the yearago quarter while total deposits have increased we will continue to focus on growing deposits to a variety of strategies including by further penetrating existing borrower base as well as expanding into the bankingasaservice base through partnerships with fintech companies on the lending front we had a relatively good quarter in terms of loan growth total loans held for investments increased million or annualized on a linked quarter basis of billion the multifamily portfolio increased million or annualized compared to the first quarter of the year despite an elevated level of prepayments while the commercial real estate portfolio declined modestly especially finance portfolio continues to grow in its growth trajectory increasing to billion or annualized compared to the previous quarter as for our credit quality our metrics continue to be very strong and rank among the best in the industry we reported another quarter of net recoveries while npas improved slightly more importantly or billion of the billion of deferrals paying interest only have returned to full payment status we expect to see a notable improvement throughout as we move closer to the full reopening of the new york city metro region since the beginning of the pandemic our total covid19related deferrals have declined substantially to billion or of total loans compared to billion or of total loans this time last year all the while were actively working with our borrowers and not incurring any losses in terms of the local economy our outlook continues to be a positive one our portion of the new york city real estate market to nonluxury rent regulated multifamily market portion is performing extremely well rent collections continue to be at the same level as they were before the pandemic and all borrowers have plenty of liquidity while we remain vigilant for any signs of weakness we are looking forward to the full reopening of the region in the upcoming months lastly id like to provide a brief update on our planned transaction with flagstar bancorp we are making significant progress on multiple fronts integration teams have been formed we meet at least weekly if not daily on the integration planning process todate a number of key decisions have been made including selection of new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 the technology platform and ancillary systems we will use and the product and service we will offer our combined customers in addition in an 8k we filed yesterday subject to the completion of the planned merger we have named our senior executive leadership team reporting directly to me and who will support our strategic priorities going forward all necessary regulatory applications for the merger have been filed the joint proxy statement was sent to both sets of shareholders last month the next milestone is both companies special meeting of shareholders to be held virtually on august 4th followed by an estimated closing early in the fourth quarter which is subject to all required regulatory approvals since we announced the merger ive been spending more time with sandro and his executive management team and our shared vision of the combined organization is more evident as each day goes by this in my opinion is not a traditional merger it is an alliance where we are taking the best of both companies and forming a much stronger better positioned organization and creating significant value for everyone the more time i spend looking at the two companies becoming one the more excited i become about the combination in addition to compelling financial metrics including doubledigit eps accretion and immediate tangible book value creation there are significant deposit growth opportunities new lending opportunities and a substantial amount of fee income opportunities by crossselling flagstars retail products set through the nycb branch network this is where the benefits of scale are readily apparent the combined company will rank at or near the top in a number of key businesses and given a bigger balance sheet we will have the opportunity to leverage up a number of businesses andor increase market share these businesses include both direct and indirect multifamily lending mortgage warehouse lending mortgage banking as well as expanding traditional ci lending into each of our markets with that we would be happy to answer any questions you may have as stated earlier in the call both sandro and lee are also here to answer any questions you may have on their results and their business model we will do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if you dont feel free to call us either today or during the week operator please open the line for questions thank you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session thank you our first question comes from steve moss with b riley securities please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc hi good morning maybe just starting here with margin expectations and loan pricing here good quarter here in terms of the underlying core just kind of color there you could give tom in terms of where youre seeing pricing going thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so obviously interest rates have changed significantly over throughout the second quarter but the good news for us is that were still holding around that significant well call it 275ish spreads to the fiveyear so were seeing anywhere from three to three and an eighth on a traditional product on the multi and respective commercial probably getting to basis points above that but as far as overall economic returns on the business as you can see the prepayments have been relatively strong and despite the level of prepayments we still grew the book so were excited about growing the portfolio were still anticipating that midsingledigit loan growth for the company and i would say and if you think about margin with the fact that we have around that type of yield coming back onto the portfolio and holding our portfolio at a reasonable growth trajectory for the year our cost of funds is still declining slightly so we anticipate further decline in our cost of funds as we move into the second quarter so id say were probably looking at i mean between to basis points of margin potential expansion in q2 so the ongoing continuation of the expansion is occurring as we set ourselves up for the business combination with flagstar which will bring a lot of liquidity more importantly a lot of balance sheet opportunity on the wholesale side that were going to evaluate we havent been specific as what were going to do there its not baked into the merger math but we have a tremendous opportunity to look at our combined wholesale liability portfolio as we bring in the excess liquidity and well make a business decision as we get closer to the the closing of the transaction so excited about the ongoing continuing margin expansion even though weve enjoyed a very unique opportunity over the past few quarters id say its been almost a year and a half now of reductions of our cost of funds and improvement in the margin we anticipate that to continue as we focus on the consolidation of the business model into sure steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 thats helpful and then maybe one question for sandro here just sandro just kind of if you could give us an update on your thoughts on the mortgage banking market and kind of where you see things playing out i do see the guidance in the deck which is kind of color around that and what your underlying expectations are with the adverse market fee coming out alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc hi steve nice to hear from you yeah look we think that the mortgage business is continues to be very strong the projections by the gses and the mba continue to look for a very very strong mortgage market what weve been trying to do as you know youve been following us is build a consistent mortgage revenue stream and i think weve found our way there and its shown not only in what weve done this quarter but also in what were guiding to for next quarter so we feel very good about the consistency of the mortgage revenue i think what you see today is we hope will be sort of on a run rate if you will plus or minus over the long term but let me let lee be a little bit more specific about that lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc yeah thanks sandro thanks for the question steve so just giving a little more color to what sandro said in terms volumes are holding up steve so the agencies and the mba have got at a trillion market at trillion at trillion and then when you look at the primary spread its been pretty constant over the last several weeks between and as have the gain on sale margins furthermore given our diversified mortgage model were able to find pockets of opportunities other originators cannot and so what i mean by that is we originate in all six sales channels we have a balance sheet which gives us available for sale health reinvestment and msr flexibility and we have an rmbs program which provides execution optionality we executed on four rmbs deals in q2 and were the third biggest issuer of rmbs in the quarter behind jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs and were planning on five deals in q3 and as the gfc step away from certain product classes such as nonowner occupied were able to step in and take advantage given our balance sheet and our mbs program the key as sandro mentioned is being consistent and we want to bring consistency to our mortgage earnings and gain on sale revenues because we have so many different levers we can pull to make that happen so in the second quarter our guided to million to million of gain on sale and in q3 im guiding to million to million the relevance of that is if were generating north of million gain on sale in the quarter flagstar is going to generate over earnings per share for the quarter or annualized thats a lot of capital and firepower for flagstar and ultimately the combined company and i want to be able to provide that consistency and reliability from mortgage every quarter and when the market provides opportunity through interest rate drops we can generate even more earnings and capital and finally with the bigger balance sheet that were going to have of the combined entity its going to give us growth opportunity from a mortgage point of view around the hfi portfolio holding more msrs the rmbs program bigger balance sheet we can hold more inventory expanding new and existing origination channels and support in the new york community bank branches and their customers as well new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc and lee relative to the gfcc that was eliminated maybe a couple or a quick comment on that lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc yeah its helpful and weve seen a pickup in our pipeline from a marktomarket point of view and from a balance sheet point of view given that were delaying deliveries until after when that removal goes live but if you think about it that bps it equates to about a 10bp higher mortgage rate for borrowers so while its elimination is positive for prospective refi volume its not going to have a material impact i think what is interesting more recently has been the drop in the tenure to around and weve definitely seen an increase in refi volumes as a result of that and combined with the fhfa removing their refi fee its helpful but the removal of that fee in and of itself wont drive a ton of volume but its certainly given us a bump or pickup on our pipeline steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc great thank you for all that color and great quarter on both sides thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you steve operator thank you our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brock how are you brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning tom im doing well hey going back to multifamily could you talk about the activity levels there and how much of the activity that youre seeing is purchase versus refi and more generally has the corrective phase within that asset class really shaking out at this point or where do we stand there thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc oh obviously its been relatively slow in the past few years but more importantly what this focus of the pandemic and coming out of covid theres been a lack of activity but weve done pretty well with our customer base new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 refi has always been significant as you can see from the quarter we had significant prepayment activity so weve held a lot of those deals a lot of them did trade away and were still good to books so we were very pleased with that id say that were looking forward to the second half as being more of a growth year opportunity for us we still feel confident that we can grow well call it the core multifamily at that 5type growth rate i think where the interesting opportunities might be is when we combine with flagstar this is going to be a growth story and i dont think anybody really has the anticipation of the capital infusion that will go into the combined entity and we can significantly increase our exposure to a lot of sandros great relationships over flagstar including warehouse commercial real estate and on the builder finance these are positions that were extremely well managed on their end and they are capped at a certain level but when you put a significant infusion to capital on a combined basis weve done it when richmond county merged with nycb we were capped at million a customer now we have substantial hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to the best borrowers i believe that type of growth opportunity will be there for us now were not giving projections for next year until we close this transaction but theres no question that the fact that the companies are combining we can increase the best customers with an opportunity to grow with us at the same time really go after the deposit opportunity throughout the branch network so were excited about the second half its not going to be a doubledigit on a standalone basis but we think we can make that net loan growth number and as far as the specialty finance business its doing really well we have about billion excess sitting out there undrawn because of the supply chain issues and people managing their overall capital stack given where capital markets are right now but ultimately as business picks up we think theyll draw down and we see that as also a potentially highteen grower as well so were excited about this company combining we think its going to be a growth story as well and thats going to be i think a catalyst for investors brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc and just following up on the multifamily whats the latest in terms of the threat to exchanges has the discussion moved on this point thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc well you know its interesting thats an interesting question because obviously if i had that answer it would be everybody would be surprised for everyone to understand it but clearly theres no question that its in peoples minds we ask i ask my top customers all the time is it positive it is what it is its a tax strategy that may or may go may may not go away but right now it seems like its losing a little bit of momentum its a big issue for commercial real estate what does it do for us ultimately the assets stay on longer assuming they take it away but the jury is out if it goes away its a pretty big benefit for both the commercial real estate owners but more importantly the city does transact they get significant economic benefits from transactions that work within the new york city marketplace so i think that will have implications to the budget of new york city new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 so as we dive into these tax strategies and right now it seems like theyre stalling is always is always an issue for longterm investors but theyll find other means to look at the value theyll take out theyll cash out refi and theyll maybe able to take less cash out refi but theyll cash out refi if the value is there and ultimately hold the asset a lot longer theyll look at situation such as looking at the other tax opportunities that are out there well there are several not as meaningful as a but there are several opportunities such as the opportunities no one that is taking advantage of and ultimately theyll plan their estate accordingly but no question that a removal was not going to be a positive for the sentiment of the owners brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay thanks for the color tom thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys nice quarter thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey i was wondering since it has been a few months since the announcement of the deal and you mentioned youve done some additional work and discovery on opportunities to enhance the performance just on a combined basis can you just frame that more quantitatively to any extent you can just some of the opportunities you expect on either the loan or deposit growth side or the fee income side i know youve mentioned the strong deposit opportunity previously going after deposits at flagstars current warehouse customers for example that sounds like a great shot on goal can you just quantify maybe how large that pool is that youre seeing there now and what you think the chances are you can capture some of that thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so we see so many opportunities as we spend time together as the two management teams are really working very hard to get to the finish line here whats most important is that when you look at the announced transaction new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 none of those attributes are in the deal right so we have this doubledigit eps accretive transaction with tangible value creation so were not forecasting the benefit of a quarter wholesale shift from wholesale to retail deposits thats going to be a significant benefit as we decide where were going to go with our liability structure therell be tremendous opportunity to look at the combined entity were liability sensitive theyre asset sensitive combined they can choose our positioning as the fed has to make their decisions towards the end of the year as to where theyre heading with interest rates thats a significant catalyst for us if you think about the opportunities we discussed on the previous question on the growth opportunity they have some very strong relationship they are number two in warehouse in the country and we believe we can hold that and grow it very nicely as i look at the best customer base that they have and expand into sizable concentration opportunities at very low risk its a very low risk business model that comes to warehouse if managed well and they do a really good job with that so excited about that opportunity all their best customers will be reignited by having a capital infusion so weve done it before as i indicated when we richmond county merged with nycb weve significantly increased our cagrs on loan growth so the loan growth opportunity is going to be real from the capital infusion in a combined basis were running just south of billion in a pro forma basis and this is going to have a lot of liquidity regarding the escrow opportunities through the inside those business model and theres going to be some opportunities to deposit a spot in the warehouse they turn away the deposits they have so much liquidity we will accept that at the same time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc right yeah thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc at the same time they were also looking at tremendous opportunities on bankingasaservice its an initiative of mine if you saw my announcement last friday were reallocating resources to building out a digital platform and more importantly bankingasaservice we had a win in the first quarter it was our first win i believe we just got another one last night actually two for the second quarter this is going to build up to a nice line of business for us as we focus on getting our fair share of the payment space over time and trying to catch up on the technology side so were excited about that but collectively theres so much opportunity on crossselling products i mean on the ci side we really dont do much at all other than hold our balances on ci were going to be in the ci business we get our fair share of a local market with our market share we should do very well on growing other lines of business and well call them verticals that we havent done in the past so were excited about a fullservice commercial opportunity over time we dont want to give any guidance right now until we get closer to closing and well talk about the opportunities but i think dave over time investors will look at this as a growth story with a tremendous credit enhancement here so we know obviously both companies have a tremendous track record on credit and the businesses that were in are very lowrisk credit profile new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay appreciate that maybe just switching gears drilling in a little bit more on the warehouse lines this quarter it looks like the balance held in fairly well just given the industry trends i was just wondering how you see that both trending from here just given the mortgage activity forecast out there i know youve talked about the cash window cap it actually helped drive some more warehouse volume in the market can you just talk about how you see that book turning from here thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so dave were super excited about the business im going to defer to sandro and lee on this because obviously they run that business currently were going to stand by that and make significant investment we believe is tremendous opportunity but im going to defer to both lee and sandro on that alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah hi dave nice to hear from you again well look from flagstars point of view we if we were as we run the business independently the way we look at the warehouse businesses we take as much as we can get in the warehouse so whatever the market gives us were going to take and so when the mortgage market is really strong our balances are going to be higher when its less strong theyre going to be a little bit lower now in the meantime given the upcoming combination of our two companies we are looking at every opportunity that we can to expand the lines that we have with existing customers and also to talk to customers who were too big for us previously so i think we can mitigate some of the natural reduction and balances that we might see in a smaller mortgage market because of the business combination but really when you look at the flagstar balance sheet you cant dont get too focused on just the warehouse business because what weve been able to prove quarterafterquarter is that if warehouse goes down something else goes up and it depends on where the opportunity is and thats the beauty of the diversified commercial business model that we have and thats why our net interest income is very consistent over time and if you look at that look at it quarteroverquarter youll see that were going to be million net interest income plus or minus to every quarter and if you believe that that is a run rate for flagstar then dont get focused on any one line of business because in any given quarter builder finance may be lower or higher and warehouse may be lower or higher but we managed to the total and then we managed to the net interest margin and weve been able to show a very stable net interest margin throughout all the economic scenarios whether youre talking about before the pandemic or in the pandemic or now our net interest margin went up basis points this past quarter so we managed to the total and we dont worry about what might be weak or strong in any particular area we look for the opportunities to offset that in other areas and then when you add the consistency of the mortgage business that lee spoke to if you can get yourself comfortable that the guidance set or the results that weve had recently and the guidance that he that hes comfortable giving you that thats there and as lee said the combination of what were doing in our commercial banking businesses and the mortgage business new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 im just talking about flagstar now you get yourself very comfortable i think that a share for this company on a quarterly basis is pretty possible and when you convert that to the combined company thats a contribution of a quarter to the total so thats a share contribution coming from flagstar to the nycb total on a combined basis thats whats powerful here and that is before talking about the synergies that you asked about and its hard for us to answer that question right now but i ask you dont focus on what the possibility is just focus on today right if you believe nycb can make a share a quarter and if you believe flagstar on a converted basis based on the exchange ratio can make a share per share per quarter over a year i mean look the value here i think the value potential is just outstanding david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah i agree thanks for all the detail maybe just one last one on expenses tom those were better than expected this quarter what are you thinking about in terms of the trajectory going into the end of the year here thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc weve been working hard in keeping the expense line obviously at a very conservative level here weve budgeted approximately million we came in about 128ish john john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc 129ish again i think it would be relatively flat q3 million ill give you some guidance for the year but since if we have to take the guidance off the table because hopefully the deal is closed by the fourth quarter by million quarter run rate for were doing a little bit better than that so 130ish obviously q1 versus q2 is lower predominantly driven by payroll tax issues the high quarter for payroll tax but were pleased were very pleased were focused on efficiencies i think theres going to be some opportunities as we combine in the longer run when we look at automation and technology we are focusing on getting ourselves caught up on being able to be more efficient by utilization of the fiserv conversion from the previous year we have opportunities as we look at the combined entities we believe that we will clearly achieve our estimated cost savings on the transaction but we think therell be more opportunities as we look at initiatives on dealing with robotics artificial intelligence focusing on the technology and issue thats going to get ourselves caught up to the industry as we move towards more of a commercial banking model so we are spending a lot of effort on the tech side and we believe theres some great opportunities to even make ourselves more efficient via the tech side david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 all right great thanks guys appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you dave operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning tom regarding the deposits that came in from the relationship with fiserv can you give more more color on the nature of those deposits and what drove such a wide fluctuation through the quarter thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc im going to defer to mr pinto hell go through some of the progress but just to be clear thats one of many initiatives were working on so we plan on building a bankingasaservice initiative but im going to defer to john to specifically go through the program john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah with that program steve thats related to the economic impact stimulus payments both round one two and three so theres a large portion of it that came from the third program so what happens is when those debit cards are sent out to the individual consumers the individual people they start using them as theyre used the deposit balances start to trend down so as you can imagine it ramps up very quickly and then theres an initial drop over a month or two which is what we saw in the second quarter as tom mentioned in his opening comments where we peaked over billion and have now come down to billion as of june and then what happens after a couple of months is that decline starts to slow down as people either use part of the card and leave the rest on the shelf for a little while so thats what weve seen we expect it to roll down much more slowly in the second half of the year so we believe itll be itll have a little duration here for us but as tom said this is just the first of hopefully many bankingasaservice opportunities that well have to bring in deposits from our technology partners thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yes steve i will tell you that as of recently we found out we just we anticipate two more to come on this quarter i believe last night we also got another anticipated win and we had a one about a week ago so for the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 third quarter we should have two more programs coming on board one is fee generated the other one is deposit generated with zero cost of deposits we have another large one thats in the pipeline well were crossing our fingers were working hard to try to win these deals and its just diversifying who we are as a company looking at the funding base we really want to move away from our dependency in wholesale finance and ultimately and going back to my initial comments we won closed to million from our customers from jan through june 30th that was from our lenders going back to our customers and getting our fair share whats ours which is our deposits so its an initiative its a culture now were changing the culture here were doing lending and you have to have your deposit relationship so we talked about initially my strategy the lowlying fruit to be taken from the customer base thats ours we have the technology we have a strong partnership with s the commercial servicing banking platform is standardized people are very comfortable with it and were going to expand upon it so when we do loans we wanted deposit relationships its not just lending and trying to find the funding its getting the loans and getting the deposits as a combination of the business relationship and were proud of that so our lending team and our retail strategies were working hard together the handoff goes from lending to retail and they close the deal and putting them onto private banking and we picked up million its a pretty good start i didnt want to give too much excitement on the initiative because its just under billion now but its a nice growth trajectory for us i think were going to have further wins we are looking at lines of credit for our best customers and part of that lines of credit is that they also bring in more deposits and its been working well for a very wealthy property owners who have been doing business with us for multiple decades its a culture that the board has clearly accepted and were going to move forward with this but its going to be the way we do business going forward its going to be about changing the culture on the deposit side we have to fund our balance sheet more like a traditional bank model and thats the goal so over time we like to see some more room on the reduction of the wholesale i think its exciting to look at the combined benefit of flagstar and nycb combining we have lots of optionality as we try to figure out where rates are going we have lots of liquidity i mean at this point in time flagstar has liabilities that are funded out to other banks well take it well bring it back onto our balance sheet and look at our wholesale position and hopefully we reduce our dependency but over the long term we want to fund like a traditional commercial bank steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc tom if we stay with the billion of deposits from loan customers one how do you size that potential and what is it youre doing to get that kind of growth are you just basically bundling the pricing with new loans thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so steve very simplistic at the end of the day our business is a relatively short portfolio its not longterm finance youre going to get a shot at these customers over and over again lets say average life of to years so as they come back to us its part of our culture its a requirement new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 historically a lot of transactions were waived were not changing our pricing its just getting our share of whats owed to us which is the operating account the lease security deposit accounts working with extending lines of credit that they have other lines of businesses that theyre more than willing to move their relationship from lets say the money center bank maybe theyre moving from your company to the from jpmorgan to over to nycb its focusing on if you want to bank with us you want if you want the money to put out we want to have here deposit relationships especially if we have the technology to service it and i think it becomes part of a cultural request its not nothing new in banking just that historically culturally it wasnt a priority of the bank im making that a priority of my leadership it has to be done thats how were looking at the business going forward in all businesses and once we start ramping up our ci expectations in the marketplace and we expand with the flagstar people under reggie davis were going to be looking at these markets and bringing in deposit relationships from the local community which we dont do currently thats going to be another catalyst now were not going to put a growth number on that but thats starting at zero so im very excited about that opportunity i know that were going to be ramping that up as we get towards into next year and were excited about getting people out in the field and getting our fair share of the customer base thats within our in our marketplace we have huge deposit share when it comes to deposits but now we need the people in the field to bring in the deposit relationships so thats going to be a focus of mine steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it yeah thanks and just finally so the prepayment income was obviously very strong and just finally so the prepayment income was obviously very strong in the quarter tom what portion of the loans prepaying are staying with you guys and given where rates are moved are you starting to see more now move to take advantage of the government option like a lockin longerterm funding thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc its a great question obviously we have million totaling million was from our ph dus portfolio so we have about a million portfolio left on the ph dus thats something we dont control thats a securitized multifamily package and we do get that from timetotime but when it comes to the business we had a couple of oneoffs id say when you take out the large oneoffs were still probably around id like to see higher i think we should do better unfortunately the governments offering a very attractive financing ill tell you whats interesting about the combined company we will be offering an alternative to the government program which is being able to offer them capital markets activity where we can swap out their instrument to allow us to be competitive and offer another product to keep the business and we may decide to package it up and sell it but we are losing some to the government and some of the larger trades that went through the quarter it is what it is that the customer makes a choice but when we fight for those longterm relationships you dont want to lose a large pool of strong relationships low loan portfolios but from time to time they make business decisions on their portfolio new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 i will tell you that it seems like going into the second half were going to be very focused to ensure that we get a lot of the breadandbutter business were mining the portfolio were very focused on looking at some other ways to get these borrowers to the table if rates were ever to go up sometime in the future this is a short book so they have to make decisions but ill tell you that the government has been somewhat aggressive as to rate but where were going to be overall competitive as we merge with flagstar and take some of the capital markets activity that we can offset some of these losses that go to the government i mean clearly having the derivative opportunity to embedded the same financial structure into the loan book and work with our customers to retain the business is going to be an option for us so it is what it is its always been its called the 800pound gorilla in the room historically its been the us government and weve done pretty well weve gone to book and prepays them in strong its been two quarter backtoback a strong prepay usually q3 is a generally slower in general because of the holidays but its usually ramped up in q4 and it seems that were focused on obviously growth so with the with the current growth where we are today going into the to the end of the year i still feel confident we can grow the book midsingle digits on a standalone basis not including flagstar steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats very helpful color tom thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks hey how are you tom i wanted to ask about the share buyback timing how much time has to pass after the merger closed before you can deploy the additional earnings and is that something thats on the near term horizon thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think its fair to say it is on the nearterm horizon obviously were in a proxy solicitation right now both sides i know that flagstar had a great opportunity to generate significant capital those numbers are actually better than expected on a combined basis on a very conservative assumption we anticipate an extra billion of additional capital outside of our current run rate that will generate for potential capital alternatives new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 and i think when the company combines obviously were in the midst of the closing of the transaction assuming were going to want to move the transaction closed well look at all capital markets opportunity including our current dividend which is very strong and we stand by as well as the opportunity to look at from time to time the buyback opportunity depending on market conditions look at the end of the day we want to put this money into growth we think that theres a great growth opportunity i know it sounds interesting because the bank has not been growing at doubledigits but collectively you have a real opportunity to grow this company as a growth story and pay a very strong dividend and depending on market conditions we can always move that over to the dividend and the buyback over time depending on how much capital is generated as sandro illustrated they generate a ton of capital were expecting very conservative assumptions when we put this deal together in excess of million and our ffo fully vetted cost saves go through thats a lot of excess capital that we would have to either grow andor buy back our stock depending on market conditions as well as paying a very strong dividend that half a billiondollar excess includes us continuing paying our current dividend so its a significant amount of capital generation christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right so the payout ratio should improve but the absolute distribution could rise as you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah absolutely so in a best world were going to look at all our alternatives but we believe theres growth and then sandro and i spend a lot of time on opportunity looking at the customer base were modeling that as we speak right now they have great relationships they capped out they will have significant runway when the capital gets infused together and go after their current customer base and also going after on the warehouse some larger relationships that they were just probably too small to offer any terms we can now offer collectively and offer them more opportunity to build that book of business so thats the priority growing the business is the priority reinvesting back into the company and building a better platform for us is going to be the priority but subject to market conditions we will put all options on the table christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and last question tom is just on the integration of the system side how much will get done by year end versus whats pushed into the first half of thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc this is the our largest transaction the beauty of it is fiserv to fiserv dna platform we cant ask for a better cause conversion this is great theyre our partners theyre sandros partners were the collectively by far their largest customer were all handson deck here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 we anticipate a lot of work has been done we will convert the systems we were shooting for been done we will convert the systems we were shooting for this early on the second half of next year so assuming we close the deal early in the fourth quarter we should be able to have this system converted by midyear next year and in the meantime a lot of great decisions have made we talked about my leadership team where weve established that weve made that public just to be clear and i stand by my alliance here its direct reports to me flagstar nycb this is not a traditional merger this is an alliance we spent a lot of time culturally integrating the status of the two franchises its super important that we make this company one its not us and them its combining the strengths of both sides and building a powerful combined entity where the culture integrates and thats the culture throughout the organization my leadership has been set now my direct reports were that their leadership and simply a blended culture so were excited about it well have dual headquarters well have unique verticals and im going to build onto it and were looking for other lines of businesses were not just stopping on what we have today there are opportunities out there it doesnt have to be bank acquisitions it could be lines of businesses that are out there has been significant consolidation thats in our marketplace and as well as in sandros marketplace we should capitalize on that theres going to be a lot of fall out and within the system that we want to take advantage of so were excited to close this deal were excited to blend the cultures and sandros team is excellent and were excited to partner with them christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you sandro thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc maybe sandro wants to add a couple of comments too i know hes on the line but i think that weve been having a very good partnership and so were looking forward to coming together here alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc well i think the question was about the integration and the integration is moving along at a nice pace teams are working together really well and i think that as tom said the fiserv relationship that we both have is a big plus so i think that getting the basic system core system converted wont be particularly difficult and then if you think about the flagstar business and the mortgage side its that nothing needs to convert there its going to stay where its at so we view this as i dont want to oversimplify it because when you when you look at it its over different systems that you have to deal with so its an undertaking but im very very comfortable with the progress that were making and i dont think there will be any integration issues that will have a negative impact on the business operations as we get to the legal day one and then eventually to the full conversion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for the background though appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning tom hey tom with the new potential lending opportunities with combining with flagstar i was just wondering how are you thinking about office space and the reason i ask is obvious the credit portfolio from a credit standard its doing great but it does seem like some level of work from home is going to be permanent and in fact it would affect the office value buildings longer term thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so that was a pete great question thats going to be interesting to find out how that all pans out in new york city you know who we are weve lent to some very strong borrowers so the collateral that we have is low leverage if you think about the well talked about criticized assets that that may lead to the office discussion we believe we peaked in february as far as assets moving into criticized category so were seeing an ongoing decline as theyre getting their cash flow to be evaluated and moving back to a higher rating thats very encouraging along with a substantial drop on loans that were paying interest only now a full payment so that trends going continue we deal directly with our large customers on the office side i think we have about maybe million thats sitting out there thats in the classified situation the ltv in that book is around it was just under and i think we have some enough room there that theres enough equity in the position that theres not going to be a loss to the bank so we feel comfortable they have ample liquidity and capacity to pay and yes theres going to be changes in how the employees think about their office space as far as were concerned were going to be very focused on continuing lending to our customers we feel confident in building out their expectations on what their future needs are and which is any event that theyre looking at moving out of the city thats fine as theyre going to stay in new york city but they are leasing up and the actual discussions ive had with many of my customers are that at the end of the day theyre comfortable that they could continue having a very strong cash flow and we reevaluate those cash flow so i think its important to understand that when you think about our exposure were a low leverage lender i cant make a statement for all of the office space in new york city but for our predominant new york city new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 portfolio its low leverage and to the best customers with significant backing so the very strong sponsorship and i dont envision any losses there peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and do you think thats a portfolio that it would decline overtime just given the changes from the dynamics thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc it could decline a little bit but i mean look commercial is commercial were going to be very active to bank the best customers in our backyard were going to expand that into sandros marketplace were going to think about remember were going into new markets and were going to be on the ground so come florida well be on the ground in florida well be on the ground in arizona were going to be theyre in the ground in michigan and other markets that they serve so we have opportunity for future growth and i think having the right leaders in those lending verticals is going to bring business to the bank and were going to do solid conservative underwriting thats who we are culturally thats how sandros team is culturally conservative and were going to do conservative lending for the best opportunities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks tom and then just if i could followup on the core margin outlook again i know that was one of the first questions but can you just clarify again what youre looking for in the third quarter and some of the drivers to the margin after the third quarter thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think the drivers are going to be consistent from the previous quarter were about basis points i think my guidance was to we came in at up in q2 and again that range is reasonable for q3 or say to 5ish and ultimately i think that as we bring on these technology initiatives that have cost of deposit that helps us but we are sitting on some excess liquidity at the end of the day we have an opportunity here to continue to drive down the cost we have some borrowings coming due not a whole lot of borrowings coming due but some that will be reduced next year we have a significant amount of opportunity exflagstar on the macro hedge that we probably save about basis points on billion of derivatives that when we combine with flagstar its not necessary to have on the balance sheet its a macro hedge against the fixed portfolio that predominately asset sensitive so well pick up a significant benefit there its about million of pretax earnings coming to the margin so it seems like well have an ongoing margin expansion throughout going from into albeit with the consolidation of this business model so whats driving it in the shortterm its going to be a lower cost of funds and holding reasonable yields on the multifamily side peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks tom new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 operator thank you our next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steven steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning good morning guys tom i think you have about billion swaps rolling off in february can you remind us how much of a boost it gives to nii and should we see that in the second quarter of next year thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so i would say to you and i think i just got on the last question we anticipate clearly with combining with flagstar the company will be asset sensitive so having that derivative on more likely than that will be removed so well take that off its probably taking about million of pretax its a benefit basis point savings on about billion going into next year i think it starts in february john john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc february yeah thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so february of next year so assuming midq1 that comes off one of many benefits were going to have when we combine the franchise which is not indicated in our forecast when it comes to the merger amount right so were expecting margin expansion and well have optionality when we go into the transaction right were going to have a large wholesale finance book that we can make decisions upon we have a substantial amount of liquidity coming from the flagstar company with respect to their escrow business and opportunities within that client base that we will maximize value on and look at the best use of the funding opportunities and ensure ourselves that set us up very nicely for next year as we combine so well have some very good optionality on how were going to position our margin and were excited about the opportunity because weve always were very dependent on a standalone basis go into the home loan bank to finance the company we want to move more towards traditional finance for a bank steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats great to hear so it may have another tailwind in the first half of next year coming on and then maybe tom if you could just you talked about that bankingasaservice is that mainly just your focus on growing deposits there or is there a credit component to it new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so right now that we havent ruled out the credit component yet that has been the longterm but in the short term were looking at fees and deposits and opportunities so we had i believe last night we notified some very interesting opportunities huge opportunities but there is a fee income opportunity i believe we won thats a positive so we think in q3 well have two more coming on one depositary one fee benefits but clearly utilizing our technology opportunities to go out there and get other revenuedepositary benefits overtime were looking at other initiatives which were not im not going to discuss in this call until we get more closer to finality but we think theres a tremendous opportunity to focus on our digital banking platform which we were almost there we intend to build it out and when we do build it out we have some significant plans there and ultimately being able to access the consumer marketplace as well as the undisturbed banking market theres a whole host of opportunities that are out there we have the individuals are theyre on their bank theyre we think through technology we can offer products and credit enhancements for the customer that could be something that could be very useful as you build out this platform so no question its a priority i called it out as a leadership role to point to the ceo but its important we have to we have to catch up weve named a head of digital were going to be hiring in that particular area we have some very good initiatives that are in the pipeline i think if all goes well this year we should have three or four wins this year and were going to build it out as we look at other alternatives that are very attractive in the digital space including and by the way steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc understood thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc including evaluating how were going to play our financial services opportunity in the block chain theres opportunities there and were spending a lot of time there steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc interesting interesting and if i could just squeeze in one more maybe this is to sandro just on the warehouse business obviously it ebbs and flows with the interest rate environment but when youre in the business for the long haul how do you differentiate and grow your market share in that business alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc well ill give you the same answer regardless of what line of business at flagstar you asked me about and its about providing the best service in the marketplace and i think we do that in the warehouse business we have been in that business for years and so we know what were doing and customers like us and we dont always have to be the best price and so i think thats why you see youve seen our ability to once we focus on it to grow from a very small line of new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 business i think when lee and i got into our positions at flagstar eight years ago that was a million balance in that business and weve grown our commitments actually and weve grown that now over billion and as tom noted earlier number two in the country behind chase so i think that the service model that we provide the ability to be there no matter what the economic conditions are when we got into this pandemic there were a lot of warehouse lenders that were not providing the support that their customers needed and we were there to pick that up and that has allowed us to gain relationships with customers that we didnt have before and we always keep enough dry powder there to be able to be there when someone is in need of a lender so its all about the service equation frankly and its proven itself to work and were going to continue to do that and i think were going to continue to be one of the top warehouse lenders in the country lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgages flagstar bancorp inc and if i could just add i mean obviously being a big originator we understand the mortgage business we buy loans from certain of our warehouse customers and we also offer ancillary lending services msr lending service and advanced lending that can be helpful to some of the bigger warehouse customers so were a one stop shop in that regard and i think thats all part of the service equation that sandro just alluded to alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc people come and go we got people that leave the business people come into the business but theres one company one thats been there for years providing warehouse lending in this country and thats flagstar steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thats great to hear i appreciate the color gentlemen operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and im sorry if i missed this but just had a few follow ups one i think sandro you talked about just the earnings power of the combined company i mean i look at your ppnr give or take about a million this quarter weve seen a big resell in gain on sales do you still see more room to go in terms of a decline in the ppnr power relative to q2 if you could just talk to that because thats been a big source of uncertainty around where flagstars ppnr shakes out and we look forward into and beyond alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 well if you look at our capital weve leveraged capital i think really really well and so were taking advantage of the capital base that we have in the company and we maximize the return that we can give from that ebrahim if you look at through flagstars total shareholder return was i think that stacks up pretty well against almost anybody and the reason for that is because we focus on the end number right how do we get to a number that gives the market confidence gives the market confidence that they can see value creation and so youve got to be able to move left move right whatever way you got to go in order to get the bottomline to where you needed to be and thats by vesting your capital in the smartest way possible where you can get to the growth and the margins and the consistency of earnings and so i cant we have never historically spoken very much about the future other than the next three months and weve given guidance in our release about the next three months so im not going to go any farther than that but id ask you to look at history and if history means anything i think you can get yourself pretty comfortable with the opportunity for growth in the future ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just a separate question tom you talked about bringing on teams some of that under the leadership from reggie davis should we expect any onboarding of hiring commercial lenders prior to the deal flows or is this going to be more of a event and even if so are you already talking to folks to bring them on early next year thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah ebrahim were extremely active whats interesting about the consolidation way were seeing its to our advantage so obviously reggie has been very busy sourcing out the opportunities in our marketplaces were doing a lot on leadership roles right now obviously were integrating the company culturally but theres a lot to do we think theres tremendous opportunity we talked about lines of businesses to be we talked about having individuals out in the field even down to the branch managers having people to brand the market managers getting out there and going after the business that culturally what we never did here at nycb thats what flagstar is doing but we want to do that for the combined company so reggie has a very substantial task in front of him were working together very well were excited about people calling us both not only just on the retail side and the ci side but also on the mortgage side i think the fact that this company is getting just south of billion in the mortgage space i think were bigger now and i think theres going to be a lot of excitement on lee smiths business that people will want to gravitate here so talent is knocking which is always great and were looking at opportunities and were standing by these businesses and were excited about the opportunity we talked about initially when we announced the deal we called it the picasso we started with a blank page what are we going to paint here starting from zero is a good start we have a lot to do on the retail side and i know reggie truly believes that our share is strong we dont have our share of the loan book and were going to get it and were going to get it with people and processes and being out there and offering competitive products and work as sandro indicated with loyalty and trust with the clients new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 and thats the plan i think its going to be a very interesting opportunity for this company well look back a year from now and talk about growth and what weve accomplished but every day we accomplished something and its going to be focused on building a better company ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sounds great thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you ebrahim operator thank you our next question comes from matthew breese with piper sandler please proceed with your question matt breese q analyst stephens inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi matt you changed firms matt breese q analyst stephens inc yeah im at stephens now thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc at piper sandler matt breese q analyst stephens inc must be old hey tom could you give us a sense for how much of the loan portfolio combined will be floating rate and able to reprice with fed hikes and i appreciate that with and without force if you have it thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc its a great question i dont have a specific number in front of me john maybe to add some insight but at the end of the day flash has always been a floating rate franchise they look at all of their deals and they have it pegged to a floating instrument weve been the sixthrate lender for the beginning of time we will have capital markets activity on a combined basis new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 were going to have the tools in our tool shed to utilize with the customer base and they could put on the derivatives to manage that on an individual basis but by culture its a fixed rate lender combining with an adjustablerate lender so collectively i think its a good balance obviously depending on what wine grows faster will really determine the floating rate inside of it but for the most part i think to be wellbalanced and im not going to be specific on you can do the quick math we have a very large multifamily book which is predominantly fixed rates we dont do a lot of floating around in the multiside because we dont really offer specific derivative contracts per instrument but thatll change as we combine but that will change as we combine and well have that offering for the customer base at the same time we also plan on working with on a capital market side alternatives versus the government alternative because its difficult when your customer has to go to the government and you lose you lose that opportunity and perhaps we can capitalize on some of our partnerships that we have on the brokers side we have a very strong relationship with meridian capital i look at them as very strong partners and were working with their team on getting opportunities there for the customer base so we can partner together with opportunities so were going to have a blended portfolio with different verticals and hopefully overtime new verticals we offer to our customer base and have more than just the traditional lending products that we have here going back to the traditional commercial bank we are transitioning to commercial banking and we will look at opportunities and were going to look at conservative opportunities culturally sandros team our team historically have been tremendous conservative lenders and we look at that as part of a hallmark of our business any business to be going to have to have conservative attributes on the lending side for sure matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then maybe turning to core margin guide plus basis points to basis points curious if thats again adjusted for liquidity like this quarter and then i was hoping for a bit of a definition for what youre calling excess liquidity so theres billion of cash on the balance sheet this quarter theres billion last quarter but i didnt see the same adjustment so i was hoping for a little bit of a definition there thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so im going to differ and i will tell you that the number i gave is just i believe anticipate id say the overall margin it depends on where we put this cash out we have excess liquidity im hoping for more growth in q3 and q4 so obviously its going to be mirrored by the transaction we anticipate to close this transaction hopefully by early fourth quarter subject to regulatory approval but clearly we have a margin thats continuing to rise its an ongoing track record for now a number of years now delving into the fact that transaction with further margin expansion and we look at being another margin expansion in regards to where interest rates are so john if you want to expand upon some of the questions on the margin side john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 yeah just quickly its really not an ending deposit balance its an average deposit balance thought process right so if you look at the first quarter our average noninterestbearing deposits was billion and then we went up to billion in the second quarter so thats the change right there thats really from that from our first technology partner relationship so thats the piece that we carved out when we looked at the margin this quarter because as it was our first one and we didnt really know the duration of those deposits and we did realize that it would peak very quickly and run down very quickly and that all happened within the quarter so when you look at it from a quarteroverquarter perspective its down a little but it did peak almost billion higher so from an average balance perspective thats why we carved it out because it really hit during the same quarter thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and matt we talked about these other initiatives we i believe we have another win that we have coming on that should be a sizable amount of deposit flows zero cost of funds that should be attractive for the bank as an alternative than using the wholesale markets for growth and we also picked up we believe we have another fee income opportunity on bankingasaservice and we have a very large one thats out there if it hits its going to be significant so were very excited about alternate looking at alternative deposit initiatives or funding strategies we believe that is the right direction for the bank we believe we have opportunities in the technologies by working with partners not only just with our existing partnerships but other partners that were bringing to the table to bring in deposit opportunities seeing opportunities and ultimately potentially lending opportunity overtime with the utilization technology so stay tuned we hope to update the marketplace soon as we get closer to getting some things done here but were excited about it matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay you mentioned expanding your financial services offering to the block chain and i was curious what capabilities are you envisioning adding or what markets you plan on attacking just a little bit more on that comment thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so matt im going to be very careful specifically where i stand i will tell you that were spending a lot of time understanding where the financial services industry is heading and then were going to be a diversified company where i believe and i think sandro and lee believes theres going to be changes in how the block chain will benefit banking services so we are very much actively looking at how that could create value for both us on the efficiency side as well as business opportunities so im not going to be specific but i will tell you that its here were beyond paying attention too and working very hard im looking at how it could benefit us new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 on a combined basis we have very large businesses that via the block chain could generate significant efficiencies and potential customer opportunity so im not going to be specific but i will just stay tuned and were excited about where we are today matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay last one for me is the tax rate stepped up a little bit this quarter what does a good run rate going forward and then if you have a combined tax rate would be helpful thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc john john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah were still looking through the potential of a combined tax rate we dont believe its going to move dramatically from where we are maybe itll be a slight benefit when we put the two together based on state apportionment if you look at the second quarter the reasons two reasons why it was higher our merger related expenses are primarily nondeductible given the type of expenses that they were and also new york state increased the tax rate from to so we did have a onetime hedge to revalue our deferred taxes for that tax increase on a run rate basis i would say were just under its a good run rate for us on a standalone perspective were still doing a lot of work on the combined basis we dont expect it to be significantly different than that though matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay thats all i had i appreciate taking my questions thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you matt operator thank you our next question comes from andrew leischner with kbw please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc morning andrew andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey hows it going its andrew leischner for chris mcgratty so you guys had a very clean quarter in terms of credit and youre able to bring deferrals down further im just wondering what your deferral outlook from here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 looks like and what your overall outlook on new york city and any potential problem areas you foresee going forward thanks thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc great question obviously in our prepared remarks we talked about the drop in the loans that were subject to interest only its down to about i believe a billion billion at the beginning of the quarter to a billion at the end of the second quarter youll see that continually drop theres going to be and as we get closer to the end of the cares act which i believe is the end of this year we believe most all of our customers will be out of any form of relief we have zero clients on full deferral which is great and its been an ongoing strategy of ours and weve been very good with our customers to work with them but were seeing significant benefits as far as the in particular manhattan reopening in manhattan has been very favorable its been the last borrower that was in the waiting game so our customers that are exposed to manhattan which was is about of the loans that were considered classified i think the most important note as this statement here is that we think we peaked we think that the classified assets peaked in february were seeing the trend start to decline that will also bode well for expenses as these assets start to decline and go back into pastrated assets we also get the benefit of the fdic expense on that so thats going to be another favorable event as we manage our operating cost but on the credit side its been a very good story sandro talked about his credit portfolio very strong story has zero loans on deferral as well so very strong credit on both sides but were seeing significant momentum on the reopening i will say that manhattan was the last borrower to get there the other borrowers are doing fine as early as january but now that we have the vaccine rolled out and the cities reopening and we see more employees come back to work you see a lot of the supply and demand issues when it comes to rental so very strong were meeting a lot of our customers theyre very pleased theres some work to do on office and retail but i think thatll follow as the employees and the traffic start to pick up in manhattan youre going to have hopefully the theaters open up and look the delta variant is what it is im not going to make a health care prediction were going to follow cdc guidelines but i think its encouraging to see new york fared well regarding the pandemic and its good to see the city moving in the right direction and our customers are very pleased and were seeing tremendous asset quality results because of that andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc
