majority of our employees worldwide are working remotely before turning the call over to jason to walk through the financials in detail i wanted to offer some brief comments on our performance for the quarter our results for the quarter resulted in earnings per share growth of northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 versus the prior year and a return on average common equity of revenue was consistent with the prior year as declines in net interest income and tradingrelated revenue were offset by growth in trust fees the persistent low interest rate environment has pressured our net interest income as well as our trust fees as reflected by money market fee waivers while overall yearoveryear operating leverage was negative the growth in trustees did produce point of positive fee operating leverage despite the impact of fee waivers which reduced our trust fee growth versus the prior year by five percentage points the current quarters results also benefited from an improved economic outlook which drove a million release of reserves for credit losses throughout the past year our strong capital base and liquidity profile enabled us to support the needs of our clients and this was demonstrated further during the first quarter as we saw sequential growth in average total deposits and sequential growth in average loan balances throughout this challenging environment we have effectively executed on initiatives to continue to drive organic growth within each of our businesses one of our key strategic initiatives within wealth management our digital marketing efforts in northern trust institute have driven more conversations and engagement and weve experienced an increase in client engagement during the quarter within asset management we have continued to see success and growth within esg mandates with assets under management of billion at quarter end and our quant active strategies have experienced strong relative performance providing us good momentum in our asset servicing business we continued to see organic growth during the quarter with the success being welldiversified across regions products and client segments moving forward we remain focused on continuing to effectively navigate through the persistent low interest rate environment focusing on driving greater efficiencies as well as continuing to grow organically in a scalable and profitable manner finally i want to express my sincere appreciation for our employees whose commitment expertise and professionalism throughout these extraordinary

resonate well in the marketplace thank you again for participating in northern trust first quarter earnings conference call today mike mark lauren and i would be happy to answer your questions olivia please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is coming from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc good morning thanks very much i guess my question is on organic growth i heard a lot of commentary throughout your minutes of prepared remarks thank you very much on positive net flows across most parts of the business i think in your prepared remarks i heard you talk about esg mandates within asset management but maybe you can cover whether you quantify or qualify ill take either one where youre seeing new business what kind of business youre winning in asset servicing and has there been any pandemicrelated pause that is now freeing up a logjam so any color on that would be great thanks mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah mike you want to start on it michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so glenn as you described there we are seeing strong organic growth across the company and specifically in asset servicing and i would say the first place i would start is the foundation of our growth strategy is retaining existing clients and as you would imagine going through the pandemic being able to support clients has been extremely important but also i think earned us the right if you will to continue to serve our clients many of them our largest clients so thats been a big positive second i would say is that we have seen i would say a full return to marketplace activity so our clients both asset owners and asset managers are actively looking at their own operating models and looking for opportunities either to become more effective in how they invest on behalf of their beneficiaries or improving the efficiency of the way they do that so consolidating operations or providers utilizing new technology and that has played very well into our strategies in asset servicing that weve had underway for years so thinking about things like front office solutions which is an investment book of record for clients that have high levels of alternative assets the ability to look at across their portfolio in order to manage their business and then thinking about our asset manager clients our whole office strategy is definitely resonating as well where we can provide services across front middle and back office so high level of activity and then i would say success with strategies weve had in place for some time period glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 appreciate that maybe just the last followup on net interest income the nim was down basis points but the deposits are up a ton do you feel net interest income has now finally bottomed and maybe some back up of your thoughts behind that in terms of redeployment opportunities thank you appreciate it mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp sure i dont want to call a bottom on it i mean if you unpack the quarter effectively we saw loan growth that was strong and up billion and that that has a few million dollar impact if you take our average return on those assets if you think anywhere from to basis points on that billion youre going to get million or million in lift for the quarter and then you also had obviously lift from the deposits overall but thats offset by something thats more predictable going forward which is were still going to have reinvestment in as the security book continues to mature and thats still got some maturation to do and so its easier to predict whats going to happen on the reinvestment side than whats going to happen on the loan side but obviously if we continue to see strong loan demand then thats more important than what were seeing on the other components of volume operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hello mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i see at your annual meeting today a priority is productivity so i was wondering if you could put some metrics around what youd like to achieve and on the positive side i see that head counts down quarter over quarter the pretax margin in the first quarter is back to the where it was not last year at all but on the negative side i have to imagine the fee waivers will continue and might actually increase so where does it all end up and where would you like to get to this year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah let me take that in a few different buckets youre right the productivity is its extraordinarily important and we go and we scratch and claw and do everything we can to earn new business thats hard to do its not overly predictable but what we can do is exhibit extreme discipline on the productivity side and so we havent put external metrics to that but were looking at it a lot of different ways internally we look at operating leverage which we talked about earlier we look at fee operating leverage and then internally were able to look at organic trust fee operating leverage northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 and so from our perspective we want to see we dont want to just call expenses up or down because a lot of our business relates a lot of our expenses relates to the amount of new business thats coming in and if we continue to show growth in the different areas of the business were going to see lift in those expenses we just want to make sure its related in the proper way to the organic growth thats coming in now youre right head count was down and that comes back to the initiatives that we talked about in january and so you see its a meaningful reduction for us of about head count and that played through in lower salary expense for the company and so those are meaningful movements and i think reflective of the discipline and the commitment we have around expense management and then on fee waivers youre right that is a its a very very difficult dynamic that were facing and i also think people need to realize weve talked about the fact that the million we have this quarter were still seeing lower rates on the short end of the curve and as much as weve seen the year year year up weve seen overnight repo at zero and one and thats very difficult for a billion pool of money market funds and thats why weve tried to give consistent information not guidance but a consistent run rate on how those fee waivers are going and as of as we sit right now that number looks more like million to million on a quarterly run rate basis hopefully as the fed balance sheet changes we see some improvement there but thats where we sit today and so its something we have to monitor and obviously that has a big impact on the pretax margin you identified mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then the one tailwind you have i guess the higher asset values can you remind us of the relationship between every change in the stock market and your fees jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure its going to it varies by the areas of the business that were talking about in general in cis about were based on asset values in some ways and then in wealth you can split it even more and mark you might have those numbers closer to top of your head but its mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp right yeah the in cis is related to asset values which would be all asset values equity market equity assets as well as fixed income or cash and then as we look across in wealth management there is more of a relationship there to the assets but the equity sensitivity if thats what you were looking at is a little different in the regions the equity sensitivity is probably to whereas when you get to the global family office there are the equity sensitivity is probably closer to a third just because of the way the client assets are allocated operator thank you we will now go to brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 good morning thanks for taking my questions so the first on the loan on and the balance sheet growth here quite robust deposit growth it was a pretty significant inflection from how things were trending in the back half of last year and so curious about your thoughts there how much of this do you view as excess it seems as though a lot of the central bank deposits on the asset side went up which would imply that you might think this is these are short duration deposits so if you could give maybe some color on what your expectations are for the sustainability of this growth in deposits and how you might be thinking about redeploying those deposits over time and how much time do you need in order to do that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp sure so youre right i mean total interest related deposits up interestbearing deposits up and i think the good news is that interestingly we were able to hold on to the margin you saw a decline in libor and even in that book we also saw a decline in cost and despite the fact that part of the book is below zero and i think thats meaningful to get to your question about volume levels and the nature of the deposits theres no doubt a lot of those deposits are nonoperational and so we need to let them season before we would do much beyond putting those at central banks that said there are other things we can do because weve got capacity in the balance sheet but obviously the nature of how we run the treasury book is to let those types of deposits the ones that are more institutional and might be more transitional season before we would take longer term exposure on those brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks appreciate that and then when we think about i think you had commented jason in response to glenns question about that really when you think about nii its a foot race in between loan growth and reinvestment rates your loan growth picked up a bit here this quarter versus the trend of the back half of last year but periodend not necessarily all that higher than the average so how should we think about loan growth from here what are you seeing as far as demand for loans amongst your clients and is the rate for that loan book still are we still better off looking at the onemonth and threemonth libors to think about those rates thank you mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp sure so first of all the loan growth has come almost exclusively or the vast vast majority has come from the wealth management side of the business and even though in dollars its not as big as the deposits the impact is much more meaningful and having billion in higher average deposits thats quite meaningful for nii and weve talked very consistently about the fact that the deposit levels are interesting theyre chunky but dont really do too much on nii it is difficult to predict what the loan demand will be however what weve experienced isnt simply id say random weve talked about the fact that we have been communicating with clients more aggressively and i this is over the last year and a half two years about our desire to be with them and be a liquidity provider for them northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 our liquidity engagement with clients is its a big part of our business and that shows up not just in what we do with the balance sheet on the on deposits but also money market funds where again billion in aum there and also on the lending side particularly on the wealth management clients and so its more this has been i think more of a strategic lift and so thats not predictive but its going to hold on or continue to accelerate but we dont see it as something that were dismissing as potentially random either operator thank you we will now go to alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great good morning mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp good morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning thanks for taking the question i want to shift gears a little bit maybe talk about capital a little bit and obviously continue to be in very strong position across all the key ratios can you guys remind us kind of kind of how you think about the binding constraints for northern trust obviously relative to regulatory minimums thats not kind of how you set the bar you typically look at your peers so given some of the changes that they have made and kind of how theyre thinking about setting the minimum levels theyre willing to run with how does that inform your view of excess capital at northern trust and then ultimately how does that translate into your appetite for increased buybacks from here jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so i mean youre right that its less of a process less of an algebraic calculation and more where we want to be on a relative basis at this point you guys have heard us talk consistently about thinking about our engagement with the board with who were totally aligned but we want to make sure that conversation continues to take place of where we are on an absolute basis how we think about things on a relative basis and how we think about things from a regulatory perspective and right now id say just keeping an eye on what the industry is doing is important so the absolute levels less so weve got plenty of room obviously from a cet1 perspective sitting at given where the regulatory minima are and so if you think about tier leverage even though the industry has talked about coming down significantly weve still printed well into the sixes and thats on billion average deposit base so im not going to im not giving you our buffers here but just take a number just to get at your question alex about what our capacity would look like if you came all the way down to that would translate to a balance sheet of about billion and you could have billion in deposits all else equal on the balance sheet today and so youre talking about easily billion on a base of billion currently and so thats a lot of room and i think also importantly its not like we use the balance sheet for clients that for organizations we dont know were really dealing from a candidate pool of depositors that are existing clients and so at this point we northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 feel good about the capacity we have but its obviously something that were watching given how dramatically things can change given fed actions and where deposits were months ago alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc right i guess i was trying to get more to the capital return framework of kind of how you guys thinking about the opportunity for share repurchases from here given the excess capital that youve outlined jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks for clarifying let me tackle that directly its interesting because this quarter is a great example of how we dont just think about do we buy back stock or not there are different ways we can invest capital and that to return target it comes up in everything we do from a capital perspective including using the balance sheet to help clients and so this quarter you saw the capital levels come down not because there is a meaningful decline in cet1 but because there is more activity from a client perspective and that showed up with an increase in rwa on the denominator and we saw higher sec lending activity we saw higher lending activity and we saw higher treasury activity in the form of more bond buying muni purchases in each of those areas were thinking about whats the best way to use our balance sheet in the long run and whats the best way to think about return and for us we can think about the returns of buying back of stock were looking at everything from what we think our returns are going to be there what are we getting in terms of price to book were also looking at the desire to be there with clients and what those returns will look like and when we have the ability to think about lending or expanding cis relationships with the other things i mentioned those things come up as very attractive ways for us to use capital it turns into better it turns into good growth for us in the long run and can good use of capital alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it great that makes sense thanks for that and then just a quick followup around nir again so i think jason in the past i think we talked a little bit about some sensitivities to sort of the repricing dynamics in the securities portfolio maybe refresh us where that sort of stands today so securities portfolio yield i think is about or so if you look at rates where they are today i want to say most of the securities portfolios already repriced lower but holding current rates constant sort of how much more of a drag on the securities yield do you guys expect to see over the next couple of quarters jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah well to give you a sense of whats repriced at this point obviously just take a if you look at the billion in earning assets its obviously all of the money market assets have repriced of the loan book has repriced and its billion of the securities so about of the securities book has repriced at this point and so thats where we sit at this point and then its interesting if you think about whats the impact of that ill tell you in this quarter alone it was a significant impact we actually had just from securities portfolio the nir was down million and so that was the drain on it but thats not i dont want you to think about that as a pure run rate because were thinking there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 about whats happening with the loan book and so there are other factors to play in as were reinvesting those securities but i want to at least start with giving you the numbers that you asked for in terms of how much is repriced and then also what the implications are but the runoffs coming through at this point and also the fact that the one two three fiveyear where we tend to be reinvesting has come up that that has brought down the influence on a quarteroverquarter basis as well operator thank you we will now go to brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great hey good morning how are you if i can start off with maybe one of the indiscernible and just that comment you made on the of the loan book has repriced it looks like that yield has at least for the last couple of quarters now bottomed and its starting to move back up so my question would be around of the thats repricing sort of what are the dynamics on that versus maybe what are some of the new loans that youre bringing on thats helping you improve that yield and then longer term most of that is tied to libor maybe just talk about the plan of whether some of those loans are going to use a new reference rate given the planned cessation of libor and how youre thinking about that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so the longer dated loans are often its going to be in the mortgage book and so thats whats going to take longer effectively just so you know the loans that have come on disproportionally the growth has come again within wealth but within personal loans and within some of our more corporatebased organizations we do have a lot of corporate theres small and midsized business activity in that book and thats where a lot of the growth has been and then in terms of the libor transition yeah as you know and im sure youre covering really closely brian therell be a transition and most that the industry seems to be looking to move from libor to sofr as a reference rate and so watching that and the implications of it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and is that transition to sofr i mean i guess its too early at this stage because theres not an effective term rate but i mean is there any indiscernible implication on the yields of the loan book by that transition or is it simply too early jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well its early but we and i think the industry is hoping that theyll be once we get to those transition dates therell be more of a reset and well have not just the reference rate changes but the spread changes and to reflect because obviously sofr is different theres not credit theres not duration in it and so its a different northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 rate and the relationship between libor and sofr is a lot different today than what it was even a year ago and so i think the industry has got some work to do to work on what the conversations are going to be like at the point where we actually make that hard switch operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i had a couple of tickytack modeling questions the first is just on the nonasset sensitive fees within custody and fund administration and weve had two pretty meaningful sequential increases these past two quarters that line item exited the quarter at about million versus what historically had been a pretty consistent range of million to million now just curious whats driving the recent strength in that line item and maybe just as we think about from a modeling perspective whats the right jumping off point we should be thinking about as we look ahead to jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah and just to make sure im tracking totally specific youre talking about other noninterest income at million on the income statement steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc its actually the million within custody and fund administration but its the nonasset sensitive fee portions so thats the part that will presumably move around with indiscernible mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah so this is mark so youre referring to when we talk about the sensitivity of those fees that about to are assetsensitive and then the rest are kind of either theyre mixed quite frankly theres transaction volumes within those there are some flat fees or fixed fees or even account level fees so you could maybe say roughly half of it is transaction volumerelated so and we did see a pickup this quarter in those transaction volumes that created some of the sequential lift that we saw or a percent or or so of the sequential lift that we saw so i hope that is answering your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah yeah thats efficient so but we should be expecting some normalization of that i presume it could be higher than the million to million but it sounds like the million may have been a bit elevated and we could see some rebasing there is that fair mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 thats probably fair i dont necessarily have the numbers that youre doing because i dont have it broken down specifically like that thats kind of a directional guide that moves around each quarter that split but yes i mean we did we certainly saw heavier transaction activity during this most recent quarter that would have benefited those fees by a bit steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats helpful color and just for my followup on nii actually a bit more focus on the liability side the beat was helped by continued grinddown in those interestbearing deposit costs its the second consecutive quarter where weve actually seen that come down just curious do you see any additional room to cut deposit costs further if the rate backdrop holds or has that lever been largely exhausted at this point mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp i felt decent about coming down a couple basis points in that book and i think its reflective that a lot of that book is international its in currencies that are already used to having negative rates and so the dynamic that weve talked about that once zero is broken theres an expectation that the beta will continue at that point seems to be playing through there and so wouldnt necessarily weve talked to clients a lot about where rates are there because its obviously can be a sensitive topic but i think the win there is weve got good dialogue with clients that indicate were all looking at things like the euro the same way and tracking deposit costs so we dont have further deterioration as the asset side compresses more operator thank you we will now go to mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp morning mike michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning thanks for taking the question just a question on organic growth and if you can provide some good color on asset servicing indiscernible question but just in investment management and particularly in wealth are you starting to see improvement as covid conditions improved versus last year and how is the competitive backdrop changed just given that it seems like everybody has been focused on that part of the business michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so in wealth weve continued to grow but youre right the marketplace is extremely competitive which is why its so important that we stay focused on both the parts of the market where we think we compete most effectively and on providing for the clients in that segment so where were seeing our strongest growth has been in the upper part of the market there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 so think about clients with assets above million and particularly during this time period where equity values are going up theres obviously been an increase in wealth so that drives growth but then also with the change in administration and potential changes in taxes and things like that it increases the need for planning so a high level of activity both with our existing clients but also opportunities with prospects michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay great and then just in terms of the expense outlook i realize you guys try to focus on aligning that sort of lower than the organic growth levels that firm over time but as we transition from say the low short rates its headwinds to nii and waiver headwinds say eventually stabilizing and then as short rates rise and eventually becomes indiscernible like any necessary like investment areas ahead or like new efficiency areas postcovid like real estate that we should be thinking about michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp ill start then im sure jason can add detail to it but its on the expense side its a very dynamic situation right now what i mean by that is were obviously still in this resiliency mode that we talked about which has certain say costs to it but also there are certain expenses that were not incurring at this point so obviously travel and business promotion is lower than it was prepandemic were not operating with as many people in our facilities the costs of operating those facilities is lower so you do have some lower costs on that front that to the extent that we transition out of that you would expect that those would increase the second thing i would say is with regard to the organic growth that weve talked about it does require investment that can be supporting large new clients and it also can come in the form of bringing on new talent to continue this growth i mean as you bring on new talent you want to make sure that youre providing the right level of service across all of our businesses and that means making sure that we have the people that go along with this and then the third piece i would just say is around our digitalization efforts which again have accelerated in the last year and i think were seeing the benefit of that but it does require investment in technology as well to ensure that yes were adding those capabilities but were doing it in the right safe secure stable way so that backdrop does say okay were going to continue to grow but its going to require investment and thats why jason talked about earlier we also have to be focused on efficiency and we did see as a part of the remote working environment there are some efficiencies in that as well and so how can we for example look at our real estate footprint and see if there are opportunities to shrink the footprint and use that to support some of the investment that i talked about operator thank you we will now go to betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 hi good morning okay couple of other themes that we havent touched on yet one is around the wealth management business and the virtual advising strategy i know thats been well underway for a while i just wanted to get a sense as to if the demand for that is more run rate at this stage or are you still seeing acceleration of demand for that strategy that youve got there jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so the way weve tackled the kind of virtual engagement through with clients in the wealth side is the continued use of our goalsdriven wealth management approach and so we were able very quickly to take those discussions and then have virtual conversations but with that same very what we think is a very differentiated platform with clients through covid it was very good engagements were very very strong and its led the business to feel that theres strong momentum from an overall client engagement perspective so thats gone well and its one of the continued large investments in wealth management and mike just talked about our investment in digitizing the business thats an area where we can use that as a core platform but add journeys to it add specific areas to become more and more detailed and specific with how with matching up with what our clients are going through very strong investment for us and its been extremely positive our net promoter scores steve fradkin who runs that business hes just talking about how strong those are and so clearly that investment has been paying off with good client engagement betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just separately i know youve been in the press recently with regard to some of the crypto custody activities that you are working on not sure when its going to be launched but i think youve got a partnership going on with standard chartered so maybe you can give us some color on that and part of the question too is does it just end with custody or can you foresee an opportunity to enable to offer crypto to your clients when i think about european investors well not just investors but the servicers the asset managers that you work with over there dealing with negative rates what i hear is that there is a decent demand for going into crypto because at least its not negative interest rate so how far is it until you or how long is it until you offer crypto as one of your liquidity tools just kind of thinking out loud mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp so betsy as you know the financial markets are constantly innovating and evolving have for some time period and in the business were in we absolutely have to keep pace with that and do it in a way that again it allows us to provide the safety and security for the clients and managing their assets and crypto and digital assets more broadly is right now clearly one of the areas thats evolving the fastest and so on that front to your point with regard to custody of crypto assets or cryptocurrencies weve partnered with standard chartered in a venture called zodia which will provide that cryptocustody and i think whats important there what were trying to accomplish is leverage the traditional custody expertise that we have that standard chartered has as well but do it in a fintech way so thats why its a separate independent entity that again can develop and evolve at that pace and at this point we still expect at some point in that that will be northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 approved for client use so again its going to be done not only our own ill call it approvals but also from a regulatory perspective and then i think more broadly to your point absolutely we see many different potential opportunities in this space where clients will look at digital assets and potentially cryptocurrencies in order to address various either challenges they have or ways to earn better returns and thats why weve not only done what i talked about in cryptocurrencies but more broadly with the digital assets whether its tokenization which weve done with bondevalue whether its developing a pe capability on blockchain which weve done with broadridge theres a number of different areas where weve experimented either on our own or with partners in order to be able to be a part of that innovation operator thank you we will now move to our next question that is coming from jim mitchell with seaport global securities please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning hey maybe just a question on the wealth management business it seemed to be quite a bit of disparity in the outcomes even though market appreciation where theres lag basis or month lag or full quarter lag was pretty similar so is it just theres a lot more fee waivers in the global family office how do we think about that sort of difference jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah you hit it right there is a distinction in the lag in that business but thats not what drove it frankly it was its the waivers hit hard and weve talked about the fact that people shouldnt see waivers as linear this is a good example where the waivers and that the gfo business obviously much more institutional and so the waivers hit later and were now starting to see it come in whereas the regions have more traditional closer to but not retail pricing and so those waivers just hit earlier second dynamic though is gfo is spiky and we have clients there that will move billions of dollars and so you can have one two three clients that if theyre all have significant movements then youll you can see big movements on a sequential basis if you look yearoveryear the organic growth the growth rate overall for gfo is actually slightly higher than the regions but obviously this sequential look was impacted by those two things one waivers and two some spiky very large client movement james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay so the incremental hit to fee waivers is that also going to be in more in global family office and maybe cis or how do you think about the geography of that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i think were i think from here its somewhat its going to be more linear i mean the funds are more theyre all there at this point in waiver mode and so i dont think were going to see as big of a disparity going forward but people should just realize its not a linear relationship and i think there is overall it was billion billion in wealth and billion of that was in billion almost billion was in gfo and so thats a yearover northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 year look thats just aggregate effectively but the onequarter look it was million in gfo alone and so big that was the increased quarteroverquarter james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet operator thank you next well move to jeff harte with piper sandler please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey jeff jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys to circle back a bit to the buyback i mean its good to see you guys out there buying million of stock historically it feels like the actual buyback comes in kind of below at least our estimated capacity is somewhat regularly i think first quarter might have given us a partial edge with riskweighted asset growth but can you help kind of differentiate kind of the buyback the difference in your thinking between just being conservative versus the expectation that riskweighted assets could actually continue ramping up like they did in the first quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its completely related and it comes back to that theme of wanting to think about returns and so and for us its not like were making a decision of do we buy back stock or just park money at the fed at basis points for us but its nice to be able to see that client activity is driving the alternative to share buybacks so thats certainly not to say that were doing zero or very little its just to say those are the different options we think about and you saw sec lending activity up significantly just the loan demand being up billion thats going to cause billion in higher rwa just in and of itself and then you see the deposits coming in which is its nice for us to be able to answer a client need but that comes with that comes with rwa as we redeploy it on the asset side and so the best thing we can do is have the balance sheet used for good return on equity activity thats clientrelated building relationships in the long run but at the same time we did do million in share repurchase over the timeframe so its not like we were absent in the market but you can imagine here at were going to be looking at what does aoci look like what does client activity look like in balancing all of those things together jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 okay thanks and just to touch on kind of the fee growth i guess growth across relative businesses it seems like cis has been outgrowing wealth management at least outpacing it for a while now i mean is that the right way that we should think about those two business trajectories going forward growthwise or is there a reason to think that kind of wealth management could start kind of catching up with cis jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp a couple of things one look every time over long periods of time we think one of the businesses is growing faster and we think oh this is going to be the case for the future you get an inflection the businesses have acted as good hedges to each other and its always difficult to predict those inflection points and whats going to grow faster for sure if you look over the last couple or few years youd see cis having grown faster but in general wealth has got good exposure to equity markets and so and you also think over the long run theres a good title growth particularly at the top end of the wealth market and so those things should help as well and so we wouldnt call a prediction necessarily on one of the businesses over the long run in the future growing faster jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co got it michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp and i would just add to jasons comments thats why we really like the combination of the three businesses not only is it complementary from a client perspective but also from a financial perspective they have different dynamics so the asset servicing business which pete cherecwich has done a great job leading and growing at a high rate it also requires resources to do that as weve talked about that and has different levels of volatility in the business whereas in wealth management very steady and at a high level of profitability and scalable and then with asset management again very high level of operating leverage in the business and has been positioned over the last couple of years for example when you can get positioned in the right products for example in liquidity and the markets go up or the liquidity goes up very strong increase in profitability for that and focused on other areas where we can have that same dynamic with esg and quant so we like all the businesses i would say from a clientcompetitive perspective but also from a financial perspective operator thank you we will now go to rob wildhack with autonomous research please go ahead mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi rob jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi rob northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research morning guys question from me on organic growth i think a year ago the prospects for organic growth were probably more uncertain fast forward to today your comments have been really positive coming out of do you see any new or different sources of organic growth that could maybe increase the longterm sustainable rate you think youre capable of achieving jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp ill start but mike im sure has some comments on this as well and lets take those lets take the different businesses in cis we hinted even early today the integrated trading solutions is something weve talked about a little bit over the last few months thats come through thats part of the reason i think theres been that lift in brokerage commission income done strategic things in foreign exchange and those arent so its not accidental i think that weve had lift in those areas and then front office solutions is another area where were trying to go to sophisticated clients and show the breadth of what we can do in wealth management the engagement there is around expanding and continuing to invest in goalsdriven wealth management and the growth weve had particularly in the upper end that product gets to weve thought so much about what million million and hundreds of millions of dollar clients need in order to interact in a good holistic way i think were set up well there and then in asset management billion i remember about a yearandahalf ago where we were on a liquidity perspective to now billion and yeah theres been great growth in the industry but they did a lot of hard things to get cut off times done well to get to open a northern trust portal theres so many different to invest in the talent we have in that group and then if you think about our esg and quant capabilities esg assets are over billion now great engagement across the nordics with very strong client base there and doing a lot with our etf platform including launching new products in europe there and so in each of the areas i think theres good opportunity for us to leverage the work thats been done to lead to stronger organic growth robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thats great thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions i guess just to followup on the integrated trading solutions can you explain that a little bit how it actually works are you is it an electronic thing or is it people that youre providing instead of your asset management clients having them and how does that work if its if five of your clients want to buy northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 one particular stock how are you separating all of that and can you give a little more color on how this actually works mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp sure at feet you can think about it as almost trading outsourcing and investment trading outsourcing and where a lot of clients realize a lot of our asset management clients realize that their core competencies around security selection and research and not necessarily having the trading operations the back office that comes with that in trade or entry and so our ability to say you can work with us and we can be your effective outsourced trading partner it appeals to a lot of asset management clients vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so they dont have to have a trade anymore and are just providing the back office for trading mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp no it starts with trading they can we can have portfolio managers and their middle office send us model accounts send us trades and we can provide that service for them and be more of a full outsourced operation from them from middle office through trade execution and trade management vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right ill followup maybe a little more offline going back to the capital question jason mike so i hear you want to obviously youre thinking about client needs and all of that stuff but even if we factor that in as we think about it what level are you sort of comfortable running your various capital ratios at whether its tier leverage or whether its cet1 is it at or is it at whatever the form it gets through whether its through loan growth securities lending growth andor buybacks what is sort of that cutoff point below which you dont want to go jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp from our perspective i think it still is going to depend on where the industry where our peers and our regulators asking us to hold on to capital to not buy back stock at that time i dont we dont call an absolute level we havent talked about our buffers externally obviously were running significantly above any regulatory minima but we havent and so weve got buffers that we use internally to manage that not something weve talked about externally but when we engage with clients we want to be able to continue telling them that theyve got that theyre interacting with a balance sheet thats strong on an absolute and a relative basis and it doesnt have its part of our strategic strength when we talk to clients and a lot of institutions you think about not just pension funds but even sovereign wealth funds if theyre investing if theyre depositing million billion billion billion theyre not really depositing theyre lending to their banks at that point and they want to be operating with institutions that are strong and so were always going to be looking and seeing where the tides are in the industry to make sure we reflect strong capital levels northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 operator thank you our next question is coming from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jason hi mike how are you can you share with us i know youre not a prime broker but there was that trading mishap in march with supposedly a large family office which probably was a hedge fund but can you just give us any color because we have never seen any risk in your global family office business at all can you reassure us thats still the case and just maybe some color around how you manage that business and manage those risks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure well a couple of things i mean youre right were not a prime broker and so were not providing that type of trading leverage to where were alongside clients and taking positions is were dealing with either our hedge fund clients or our family office clients in the family office business we have some loans but those are much more the loans that we see in the traditional wealth business which are loans against investments that clients will have the longterm clients theyre not taking that type of exposure and so the services that we provide for our hedge fund clients and our gfo clients its much more about assets servicing asset administration investment reporting thats how were going to market to deal with those types of clients and so just to put anybodys mind to rest we didnt have any exposure to the hedge fundfamily office that youre talking about and dont see that type of exposure in our portfolios gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc speaking of asset servicing and reporting that you just did is there an opportunity to capitalize and if the sec requires more disclosure from the family office organizations as a possibility as a result of what happened would that be an opportunity for you guys to do more work for your customers and therefore maybe more revenues jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah its an interesting nuance because we a lot of our clients on the hedged space they actually are sec registered and so were used to dealing with them and helping those types of institutions on doing the reporting and administration that they need to do for their sec registration material and engagement and so that it would be i dont think its monumental opportunity for us we havent talked about it that way but certainly we have that capability set and would be seen as a strong provider for hedge funds that were looking to have more of a traditional investment reporting and an overall fund administration engagement with their service providers operator thank you we will take our final question from brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi brian brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning great thanks guys two questions one first one on the comp expenses i heard that the million of comp was retirement eligible and then did you also say that you absorbed the merit increases yearoveryear so those are getting paid out in the first quarter now i thought that was getting paid up in the second quarter historically just going to think of the to trend here for comp jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah no the merit will come through second quarter what i did mention earlier was that this may have been what you got your mind going is we the reduction in overall fte and head count for the company did lead to a lower salary level in the quarter but that oneoff but thats not thats distinct from the merit increases mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and just to clarify this is mark the base pay adjustment the yearoveryear increase is still reflecting of any base pay adjustments that happened in the previous year were still lapping that so if thats what you were referring to brian in the release there and some of the comments we made that would have been what that was referring to not this year brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks and then can you guys just talk about the trends in investment management i think even youve adjust for the fee waivers looking at the first quarter relative to the third quarter youre not seeing much in terms of revenue growth despite the change in market levels over that time period can you just maybe touch on the flows in that segment thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp 1yeah mark may want to touch on close in general but mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah so in the cis line i think thats what youre looking at the investment management fees on a sequential basis ex waivers i think we were up about probably three quarters of that twothirds to three quarters of that came from a market lift so there was some sequential organic growth there but i dont know if thats what specifically you were looking at brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc for the fee waiver so i mean it sounds like flow trends in there are more positive northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah there was some flow activity that we saw there like mike had mentioned weve been seeing good growth in esg some of the quant active products as well but the waivers there on a sequential basis certainly kind of overwhelmed what we saw from both favorable markets as well as business flows brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks operator thank you that will conclude todays questionandanswer session mr bette at this time i will turn the conference to you for any
