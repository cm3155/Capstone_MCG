customers inperson even if its across a plexiglas barrier or from a distance of six feet our teams response to this ongoing pandemic continues to demonstrate whats unique about this company our culture of service our focus on customers and communities our adaptability in changing circumstances and our ability to execute all of those along with continued economic recovery contributed to our strong performance in the third quarter of before i turn the call over to jamie ill share highlights of the third quarter on slide diluted eps was per share compared to last quarter and a year ago adjusted diluted eps was per share compared to last quarter and a year ago the primary difference between reported and adjusted figures for the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 quarter was a per share impact from a goodwill impairment of our mortgage reporting unit that jamie will detail shortly periodend loan balances of billion were down million from the prior quarter with commercial loan growth partially offsetting declines in the consumer portfolio of loans had a full principal and interest deferral at the end of the quarter down from in may total deposits of billion were up million from the prior quarter broadbased core transaction deposit growth of billion allowed us to accelerate our deposit pricing and remixing strategy which led to stable net interest income at million the net interest margin declined basis points to slightly better than we expected as headwinds from student loan sales and bond portfolio repositioning completed in the second quarter were partially offset by the favorable trends in deposit pricing and remixing adjusted noninterest revenue of million was strong up million from the prior quarter the improvement was led by quarteroverquarter increases in net mortgage revenues of million and core banking fees of million adjusted noninterest expense of million was down million from the prior quarter led by the improvement of million in employment expenses provision for credit losses of million were down million from the prior quarter the acl ratio increased basis points to excluding p3 balances past due npa and net chargeoff ratios remained relatively stable the cet1 ratio increased basis points to following strong core performance in the settlement of transactions we executed in the second quarter our total riskbased capital ratio increased basis points to the highest level since jamie will now share more detail about the quarter andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel before moving to slide id like to provide an update on goodwill we have been conducting evaluations of goodwill in response to market volatility and expectations for a lowerforlonger interest rate environment referenced by the fomc in august as a result there has been a goodwill impairment for our mortgage reporting unit of million this is a noncash charge that has no impact to cash liquidity tangible book value or regulatory capital ratios beginning on slide total loans declined million in the third quarter as commercial loan growth helped offset reductions from p3 loan payoffs of million and strategic asset dispositions of singleservice loans excluding the impact of asset dispositions and p3 payoffs we had net loan growth of million in the quarter commercial loans excluding p3 balances increased million although pipelines are lower than they were precovid we continue to see demand especially in middle market businesses and our higher growth and our higher opportunity markets such as atlanta birmingham and south florida consumer loans declined million led by the disposition of roughly million of nonrelationship mortgages along with continued declines in our lending partnership portfolios additionally a portion of the decline can be attributed to the continuation of our greensky strategy which we highlighted last quarter and which to some degree is offset by an increase in balances within our heldforsale portfolio synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 while we will continue to evaluate opportunities to efficiently manage our balance sheet there are currently no existing plans for material dispositions such as those we made the last two quarters we expect loans excluding the impact of p3 forgiveness to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter as shown on slide we had total deposit growth of million more importantly were continuing to strategically reposition the portfolio broadbased core transaction deposit growth of billion offset the strategic declines in time deposits of billion and broker deposits of million we estimate approximately billion or of deposit balances associated with p3 loans remained on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter the cost of deposits fell by basis points from the previous quarter to basis points due to a combination of rates paid and deposit remixing for context this compares to a low of basis points in the third quarter of we continue to believe there are further opportunities to reduce deposit cost through cd turnover repricing and remixing these activities in an environment of lowerforlonger interest rates combined with strong growth in core customer deposits should allow us to get our total deposit cost to the basis point lows of the prior cycle slide shows net interest income of million stable from the previous quarter and included million in fee accretion from our p3 loan portfolio there is million of p3 processing fees remaining earlier this month the sba announced a streamlined forgiveness process for certain p3 loans of or less approximately of our p3 balances fall within this threshold there is approximately million in fees associated with these loans which will be accelerated when we receive the forgiveness proceeds net interest margin was down basis points from the previous quarter consistent with our expectations the current level of interest rates combined with a basispoint headwind from bond repositioning and student loan sales executed in the second quarter put downward pressure on nii and nim in the third quarter however these headwinds were partially offset by a handful of factors including further declines in deposit pricing and favorable deposit remixing trends our guidance from the previous quarter largely remains the same and we continue to expect modest downward pressure on nim as repricing within our fixed rate asset portfolio is partially offset by continued declines in overall deposit cost and further improvements in managing liquidity cost excluding the potential impacts from p3 forgiveness we expect nii and nim will decrease slightly in the fourth quarter it was another strong quarter for noninterest revenue which is shown on slide core banking revenue improved by million from the second quarter primarily due to increased transaction activity as most components are gradually returning to precovid levels net mortgage revenue of million remained elevated primarily due to increase in secondary revenues driven by higher loan sales and gain on sale secondary mortgage production was million in the third quarter which is an increase of million or from the second quarters record production we continue to see positive momentum in other fiduciary service business including brokerage and trust assets under management of billion grew from the previous quarter other income for the quarter included a valuation adjustment for tax credits and gain from the previously mentioned mortgage portfolio sales in the fourth quarter we expect stable revenues from core banking fees fiduciary services and capital markets income we expect to see declines in mortgage revenue and other income slide includes noninterest expenses which were million or million adjusted adjustments include million in restructuring charges primarily related to branch optimization as well as the million goodwill synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 impairment previously discussed this goodwill impairment is limited to the mortgage reporting unit and results from a combination of factors including the extended duration of lower market valuations high volumes in refinancings that have reduced mortgage yields and the clarity around longerterm policy actions designed to keep interest rates low total employment expenses were million less than the previous quarter primarily due to lower commissions lower head count and reduced covidrelated staffing expenses total covidrelated expenses for the quarter were minimal we expect further head count reductions in the fourth quarter as part of the normal attrition and a voluntary retirement offer we recently extended the voluntary retirement offer is expected to result in a onetime fourth quarter expense of approximately million and have a twoyear payback these savings are part of the synovus forward initiatives and will help offset expected increases to other line items such as travel and advertising in as banking activity return closer to normal we continue to focus on what we can control which includes prudent expense management excluding the upfront expenses associated with synovus forward initiatives we expect adjusted nie in the fourth quarter will be in line with the third quarter key credit metrics on slide there were slight increases in npa npl and past due ratios from the previous quarter but we currently do not see widespread deterioration in the portfolio our comprehensive reviews have largely isolated the elevated risks to certain segments including hotels and fullservice restaurants and we continue to work with borrowers who have been most negatively impacted by the pandemic provision for credit losses of million includes net chargeoff of million or basis points downgrades in the hotel portfolio one of the hardesthit industries accounted for million of the increase in increase in criticized and classified loans there were million in our hotel loans that had principal and interest deferrals at the end of the quarter which represents about of the total hotel portfolio our latest economic outlook includes an unemployment rate of about as of yearend before declining modestly in this along with credit migration and other portfolio activity resulted in allowance for credit losses of million up million from the previous quarter the allowance for credit loss ratio increased basis points to excluding p3 loans the amount of provision for credit losses going forward will continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors including economic outlook loan growth loan mix risk rate migration as well as the timing and impact of future government stimulus heightened levels of uncertainty and those factors could result in reductions of allowance less than net chargeoffs as the outlook becomes more stable and uncertainty declines we expect changes in allowance to rely more heavily on the traditional factors previously mentioned preliminary capital ratios on slide continued to build from a combination of earnings and balance sheet activities completed over the past several months these balance sheet activities include the settlement of our second quarter bond repositioning and our ongoing efforts to reduce singleservice loan portfolios as we prioritize our balance sheet for core client relationships cet1 increased basis points to this quarter thats an increase of basis points from the end of and was accomplished while increasing the reserve by million the total riskbased capital ratio of up basis points from the second quarter was the highest since we remain focused on supporting our overall capital position and are targeting the higher end of our cet1 operating range of to given the heightened uncertainty in the current economic environment we expect core earnings will continue to support our capital position and allow us to achieve our strategic objectives with synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 consideration for our anticipated balance sheet growth and the payout objectives weve outlined previously as a reminder we do not expect any share repurchases for the rest of the year ill now turn it over to kevin who will provide updates on deferments and some of our strategic objectives including synovus forward kevin blair president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie id like to begin on slide with an update on deferments at the end of the third quarter we had million in loans on a full principal and interest deferral which was less than of total loans the aggregate amount in deferment was well below the to range we estimated last quarter and down significantly from the we referenced in our first quarter 10q filing we attribute the lower pi deferral activity this quarter to the strength of our borrowers and improving economic environment and support provided through various government stimulus programs of the million in deferment at the end of the quarter or million were in the consumer book these were predominantly consumer mortgage loans which are largely comprised of physician and private wealth customers the million in deferments represents approximately of total consumer loans commercial deferments as of were million or basis points of the total commercial portfolio full pi deferments were largely concentrated in the hotel and fullservice restaurant segments which comprise or million of commercial deferments at the end of the quarter we have not only seen a significant reduction in the level of deferments we are also seeing strong performance from those that have exited a deferral status have made a payment while another to have not had a payment due or were in a grace period at the end of the quarter only approximately basis points of loans that exited a deferral status were past due or moved to nonaccrual status at the end of the third quarter in addition to the full pi deferment program we have continued to work with other borrowers who have been impacted during the current crisis to provide flexibility in payment terms which may include modifications such as interestonly or amortization extensions inclusive of these modifications we estimate that total loans with accommodations as of the end of september remained below which was at the low end of the range we projected last quarter for full pi deferrals moving to slide and the covidsensitive industries we shared on the second quarter earnings call a second round deferral estimate for each of these industries consistent with the loan portfolio in aggregate these industries also had a lowerthanestimated level of pi deferments at the end of the third quarter as we mentioned on the previous slide the hotel and fullservice restaurant segments had a total of million with a full principal and interest deferment as of well below the original estimates the hotel industry continues to be a segment that has been hit the hardest by the change in customer behaviors which was reflected in the downgrade jamie mentioned earlier but the vast majority of our portfolio continues to pay as agreed despite the results todate we continue to closely manage and monitor this portfolio as we do not see the normalized return of revenues in the near term we have however conducted indepth reviews of the loans in the hotel portfolio and from a longerterm perspective we feel that we are very well positioned in several ways these include low loan to value highquality hotel properties with great brands and sponsorship from guarantors with strong liquidity synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 as it relates to the restaurant industry we have seen signs of recovery since the reopening efforts of april and may quick service and fast casual restaurants in our portfolio have largely recovered based upon our cash inflow data and in some cases are outperforming precovid levels synovus has million of fullservice restaurants and using our portfolio cash inflow data we estimate they are operating at an average of of revenue compared to the prior year there were million of fullservice restaurant deferrals at the end of the third quarter it is worth noting that we do not have any shopping center customers in a secondround deferral while we continue to closely monitor this portfolio our customers have experienced improving rent collections during the last quarter overall due largely to the strength of the grocery pharmacy discount and home improvement segments we are also seeing stronger recovery in inline service provider tenants that alleviate much of the concern from spring and early summer retail trade arts entertainment and recreation as well as oilrelated industries also had no deferments in the second round and we continue to be optimistic as to the ability for our customers to weather the shortterm cash flow reductions experienced during the economic shutdown while the deferral trends are extremely positive to this point we are keenly aware additionally mandated closings from covid surges in our markets would have the potential of impacting cash flows and would affect these segments more quickly and severely therefore we will continue to closely monitor and manage our exposure within these industries as a reminder our credit review process that we initiated during this crisis serves as a basis for determining whether a deferment is necessary and includes a thorough analysis of current conditions as well as incorporating forwardlooking projections and sensitivities including cash burn rate analysis moving to slide it provides an update on our portfolios cash inflows consistent with what we shared on last quarters call the graph shows continued improvement in yearoveryear cash inflows which serve as a proxy for revenues during the third quarter we saw the portfolio yearoveryear inflows improve from being down in june to being up in july and then settling in essentially flat with the prior year in august these results are largely consistent with various industry metrics as well as the conversations were having with our customers throughout our footprint in addition to cash flow improvements we have also seen our customers making the necessary adjustments within their expense bases to further reduce the impact the crisis is having on their bottom line weve included trends for some of the industries that were considered to be more sensitive to covid including accommodations retail trade food services and other services results in these segments show consistent trending with the portfolio as a whole but also note the deferring impact within industry segment which has served as the basis for many of the kshaped recovery scenarios that had been developed and discussed more recently we continue to use this data to inform our bankers as well as support our covidspecific deferment and portfolio management programs as i close out my section let me transition to a business and synovus forward update which weve highlighted on slide we have maintained three primary focuses on the business front in number one proactively manage the credit environment through the current economic downturn as ive shared on the previous slides we feel good about our progress and results today in this area number two utilize our relationship banking approach to continue to serve our customers expand share of wallet and attract new relationships despite the challenges presented by the pandemic we have continued to drive core loan deposit and assets under management growth while improving service levels and adding new synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 technology to support our customers changing needs throughout we have accelerated the deployment of new digital tools and capabilities with enhanced servicing and online origination functionality with the overarching goal of making it easier to do business with us as well as the changing business dynamics associated with covid digital user enrollment is up yeartodate and weve experienced a increase in the number of deposits being handled outside of our branch network we have achieved this success as we partnered with existing and new fintechs to efficiently and effectively deliver these enhanced capabilities we fully recognize and remain committed that when we get to the other side of the current challenges we face we want to be even better positioned to grow and win in our marketplace and that brings me to the third area of focus synovus forward we remain focused on the execution of this program to drive incremental efficiencies and sources of new revenue now and in the years to come our original financial objective of an incremental million of pretax income remains the baseline for execution we are beginning to realize the benefit of several of these initiatives while we kick off additional initiatives that will have deliverables and run rate benefits as we progress with these we will continue to update and finetune the size and timing of the benefits on the expense front we are executing on the million thirdparty spend program with workstreams continuing to be implemented through the early part of our plan for branch closures in remains on track with additional back office real estate consolidation plan for we are also inflight with our overall organizational efficiency program this program is a comprehensive portfolio consisting of many initiatives that will deliver reductions in personnel and other expenses as well as cost avoidance and additional areas throughout the remainder of and execution on these initiatives are underway as jamie noted the reduction in head count during the third quarter another example of progress is the voluntary retirement program which we announced during the third quarter and will largely be completed in the fourth as jamie mentioned it is expected to have a onetime charge of approximately million and have an earnback period of less than two years we will continue to update and provide further details as we execute on the overall organizational efficiency program and we remain confident in our ability to generate up to million in savings overall as weve previously noted we will continuously evaluate the underlying economic environment to gauge the size and the timing of our overall expense management program while weve been more focused on the efficiency initiatives out of the gate we are progressing the revenue opportunities that were identified during the diagnostic phase with continued confidence in the pretax income range of million to million we have kicked off our pricingpervalue and customer analytics workstreams these initiatives have the potential to begin creating revenue enhancement in through the repricing of solutions and products as well as enhancing tools and capabilities to improve sales and retention efforts the dedicated teams leading these efforts are adjusting and enhancing the program on a continuous basis as we complete the programs and the execution in inflight phases we have additional initiatives that well commence which are all part of our longerterm strategic roadmap and change management plans with those comments now let me turn it back over to kessel kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin before we move to qa slide highlights a few accomplishments from the quarter that we believe are just as important as the numbers weve reviewed today i will not cover each one in detail but just to synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 summarize we expanded the talent and expertise of our already strong and diverse board we were named by forbes as the best employer for women we celebrated as two of our seniormost female leaders at our executive and board levels were recognized for their contributions to our company and our industry and we formed a council comprised of some of our most senior africanamerican leaders to ensure accountability for continued progress in promoting racial equality weve made significant investments in education including donating million to the united negro college fund to provide scholarships for africanamerican students who want to attend historically black colleges and universities or other higher learning institutions across our fivestate footprint weve continued supporting our communities through increased outreach and financial investments as organizations schools individuals families and entire communities face unprecedented challenges and we continue to deliver financial education across the footprint through our now virtual raise the banner program and finally weve remained active participants in multiple cares act stimulus programs to help our customers recover sooner rather than later were proud of these actions and we believe they reflect our deep sense of responsibility for leading and strengthening the communities we serve and with that operator lets open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc in terms of the goodwill impairment charge could you just help us understand whats different about your mortgage business versus other banks that are not taking impairment charges andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey ken good morning this is jamie ill just jump right into that i think that i cant really compare us to other banks what id say is you look at that reporting unit and its one of the highlights of you look at the activity synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 the fee revenue the growth youve seen there the production its really been a success story but the goodwill calculation is based on when you originally make that valuation and what is the current longterm outlook and whats changed for us is that longterm outlook has really no rate increases and so when you have a long duration assets like mortgages on the balance sheet and you dont get any benefit from interest rates for extended multiyear periods it hurts the valuation of that reporting unit so it has really nothing to do in my mind with anything comparing us to others or comparing the performance of the unit it really has to do with this lowforlonger interest rate environment and the impact that has to the roa of a business that has longduration assets on the book and so thats the story on the goodwill impairment and the mortgage reporting unit ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc that helps and then next question whats the yield on the new loans that youre putting on in and then also is it fair to assume that your total portfolio loan yields will trend down to that level over time andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ken the yield going on yield in the third quarter was in the low to mid and if you think about our book yield on our loan portfolio in the low its hard to say where spreads will go but it is safe to assume that we will drift towards that lower end over the maturity of our loan portfolio but id tell you that when we look at that and we think about the margin and when youre really looking out to the horizon we see the headwinds of the loan book repricing we see headwinds of the securities book repricing but we believe that the opportunities on the deposit side on the liability side will be a strong mitigant to those headwinds and so thats how were looking at the margin when you think about it over the long term clearly in the third quarter you saw success on the liability side and were committed to continuing that ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then great job on improving the cet1 ratio that was very helpful andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc but just along those lines you did mention that you dont expect share buybacks for the rest of this year but does that imply that you actually might consider buybacks in early kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp well ken when we think about capital in aggregate first as you mentioned were very pleased with where we are and when we think about capital adequacy and balance sheet resiliency we really look back to all the way back to precrisis and so you think about coming into this year to cet1 we have increased that basis synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 points till september but weve also at the same time increased our allowance significantly and so we feel good about the progress were making there we came we went out publicly this quarter saying that were targeting the higher end of the range of to cet1 and thats our priority we just see uncertainty in the environment and so were looking to continue building capital and share repurchases just are not at the top of our list as you saw in the third quarter we grew core loans core organic loan growth of million thats our priority we want to deploy capital to serve our customers and thats when we think about what is front and center in front of us like thats our focus is deploying capital for our customers and share repurchases thats just what falls out of this at the end ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah so thanks for providing all the color on credits and the deferrals but would love to spend some time on just the interplay as we look forward around credit provisioning costs outside of any growth talk to us in terms of given the work youve done your expectations around migration and how much of that loss content of expected migration has been reserved for versus what maybe what may require additional reserve and just if you could talk through in terms of that and how we should think about provisioning and reserve build going forward i think that would be helpful andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim as we look at the allowance and we think about what does it look like going forward obviously with million the acl this quarter we feel that that covers our future chargeoffs now embedded in that is some uncertainty and so we have increased the weightings to adverse scenarios this quarter and so thats embedded in our calculation and as we go through this crisis as we get more certainty on chargeoff and the outlook we would expect the weightings to alternative scenarios to decline and that could benefit the allowance or not synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 and so thats an important consideration the migration that you saw in the third quarter that impacted the calculation and we expect as we look forward we do expect to see all of this flow through npas chargeoffs as we go through the cycle and so as we look at the allowance where were comfortable with where we are at million on loans excluding p3 and i think that sums it up robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp hey ebrahim its bob if i could just follow up on the migration piece jamie that you mentioned just to kind of maybe put a little more color around the increase you saw there in criticized classified a large portion of that is our hotel book and while we do expect to see this type of migration to jamies point a lot of that portfolio ebrahim was as you know was low loan to value strong debt service coverage et cetera had a tremendous dropoff in revenues so the risk rating process is pretty thorough and has to follow that dropoff in revenue but we dont expect that entire criticized classified book to migrate all the way through to nonaccrual and charge offs so its on a casebycase basis ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful and i guess just switching to jamie i think you mentioned a slight decline in nim nii but just talk to us in terms of how we should think about the loantodeposit ratio given the liquidity the potential runoff in deposits when ppp is forgiven do you expect that loantodeposit ratio to move back closer to the high as it was precovid and does that mean you continue to run off time deposits broker deposits for several quarters to come andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim let me decompose that into the two parts as we look at the loan portfolio were expecting loans to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter and so were not expecting to see much growth there for the rest of this year but when we look further out and we will give guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call in january but when we look further out we do expect to return to normalcy and we do expect our customers to be looking for liquidity for themselves and to be borrowing and so as we look forward we expect to resume loan growth like you saw precrisis the opportunity in the southeast is as great as ever and were ready for that were positioned for it i think its why you see some loan growth in the third quarter and so we believe that loan growth will resume in the deposit side is a little murkier given everything thats going on including the federal reserves balance sheet and so its more challenging to forecast on the liability side but i tell you that if this liquidity environment continues and if it stays similar to what it is today then yes you will see us using this liquidity environment to optimize primarily our liabilities so what youve seen earlier this year is weve reduced our borrowings our wholesale borrowings at home loan bank weve reduced our broker deposits weve reduced pricing and so thats where the largest opportunity is for us with the excess liquidity and so i think thats what you would continue to see in the near term kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and jamie i was just going to add ebrahim im sorry this is kevin in terms of the p3 deposits versus the loans i mean we have roughly billion of ppp loans and roughly billion in deposits so those were largely offset one another with just a small gap in terms of whats already been spent from the depository side so synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 thats not going to create an inflection point that would increase the loans to deposit or the yeah the loanto deposit ratio ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just to follow up to what you responded to kens question earlier should the basic expectation be that the nim continues to drift a little lower over the next several quarters maybe not by much but the direction is lower andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ebrahim we do expect to see slight downward pressure if you think back to july we gave guidance of basically flat from a million area our outlook hasnt changed from that look were very pleased with the deposit pricing we saw in the third quarter and the effort of the team in that regard but we do expect to see some slight downward pressure on the margin ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning john andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc regarding the increase in criticized loans i appreciate the color you gave and thats driven by hotel and restaurant the increase is definitely larger than what weve seen at others that have hotel and restaurant concentration so i just want to get a little bit better understanding of the drivers i know your increases in your criticized assets over the past couple of quarters have been less than peers so was there a degree of a catchup synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 here i mean did you do a thorough review of the portfolio that drove that and also wanted to get your thoughts on the outlook is there is it fair to assume that incremental increases here may be less on that side thanks robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey john this is bob and i wouldnt call it a catchup as much as i would call it to your point a pretty detailed and thorough analysis with each of our borrowers our hotel group is most of the hotels are in our concentrated vertical group with our a real good team of experienced bankers we wanted to go through each hotel very methodically very carefully look at their demand drivers where those properties were et cetera so i think it was just more than an evidence of our thoroughness in the analysis versus trying to play catchup there i certainly wouldnt use that term i feel like we did that in this quarter were kind of at a stable point maybe to your last point i would expect to see minimal migration but i would qualify all of that by saying we just dont know as we go into the fourth quarter relative to hospitality so it is still while its recovered some its still operating in a fairly difficult revenue level so well see how that plays out we feel like weve graded appropriately today we feel like our allowances is reflecting our future expectation of losses in that portfolio so again a lot of its just going to depend on what the environment is as we go forward into the fourth quarter and into john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thats helpful and then and accordingly given what you just said in terms of the allowance if you dont see material incremental upside moves in criticized and classified is it fair to assume that as those chargeoffs materialize and rise that they should go against the reserve and accordingly we dont see incremental reserve additions and probably see releases andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right youre thinking about that right john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay okay good thanks and then separately on the loan side i know you did flag in your prepared remarks some emerging demand that youve seen on the commercial side i just want to see if you can kind of walk through what areas that youre actually seeing a bit of demand starting to materialize kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp hey john this is kevin so during the quarter we actually saw growth in our ci book as well as cre and its really broad base across many of our areas our middle market banking area continues to grow and a lot of thats just takeaway business we talked about in the second quarter where we were able to garner new relationships through the p3 program and that program by providing that initial loan has led to additional business which has been helpful for us but we had made a major investment in that wholesale middle market space and it continues to pay dividends in the current environment we also are seeing growth in our specialty lending division which includes our premium finance group as well as our structured lending as well as assetbased lending so were seeing growth there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 on the cre side some of that is on draws on construction versus new origination in general total production is down about on linkedquarter basis overall but the runoff and the attrition is down at a higher level so thats whats generating the growth to the portfolio but as jamie mentioned earlier part of this is a story of just economic demand and we believe that will return at some point in the near future and we feel like were well situated to be able to take share and continue to grow with our customers as they grow john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks kevin operator operator instructions our next question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brad andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co just wanted to maybe ask about the synovus forward initiatives kevin i appreciate all the color that you gave in your prepared remarks just curious how much do you think is maybe currently in the run rate and as a follow up to that specifically maybe around fee income theres a big bump in kind of that other category this quarter i know kind of stars can align in a given quarter but just curious any additional color there and maybe thats maybe we stepped up to a new run rate as part of the synovus forward initiative but just any color there would be helpful kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah brad one of the things we want to do in subsequent meetings is give a timeline on the realized benefit of synovus forward but were very pleased with where we are as you saw in the prepared document that were starting to execute on the thirdparty spend which has a longterm run rate impact of million by the end of the third quarter we believe that weve been able to capture roughly million of that not for the full quarter but by the end of the quarter and so youll see that roll into the fourth quarter and that will continue to increase from a branch real estate optimization perspective as i mentioned we have closed eight branches yeartodate and on track to close and so weve got about million of savings from those branch closures already in the september run rate number and its important there is that were starting to look at other back office opportunities not just the branch side to be able to generate additional savings those will come early in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 the bigger item as you can see on our chart is this organizational efficiency initiative and its going to represent over million of run rate savings and cost avoidance jamie said during his remarks and i mentioned them in mine we did roll out in the third quarter an early retirement program thats going to result in a charge in the fourth quarter of roughly million but have a twoyear earnback so were going to get a millionplus savings from that transaction or that initiative and that will start to show up at the end of the year so many of these initiatives is i would say at this point probably about million of expense todate more of them will start to roll in in the fourth quarter and the goal is to have all of the savings fully accounted for by the third or fourth quarter of and youll note that we put a plus at the end of the organizational efficiency as i said in my remarks were prepared to flex and increase that as the environment warrants as it relates to revenue at this point we dont have any of the revenue initiatives in the run rate and so those will begin to fold in in and ill turn it over to jamie for the other expense question or other income question andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah if you think about other income youre right to think that some of that is more onetime in nature and ill specifically point you to about million we had about half of that was gain on sales the mortgage loans which again is similar to the second quarter the loan sales that weve been executing the vast majority are at premiums to book price which is a testament to the quality of these loans and so thats one and then we also had a gain on a solar transaction so those are more onetime in nature and impacted to the good q3 other nir brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thats helpful and just my followup jamie would be are you pretty much done with building the bond portfolio do you anticipate continuing to add to it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp if you look at that in the near term you should expect to see some increases there its hard to give good guidance on as a percentage of loans which is or percent of assets given the impact of p3 but as we think longer term somewhere in the context of of total assets make sense for the bond portfolio brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 good morning jared andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just following up a little bit on the synovus forward and some of those longerterm additional opportunities i guess maybe in a different way what do you are you targeting an efficiency ratio outcome from this is that maybe an easier way to think of maybe the longerterm benefits of future moves on either revenue changes or expense efficiencies andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jared this is jamie as we think about all of these initiatives and this just permeates into how we run our businesses as we look at topquartile performance and obviously thats a very vague concept right now just because its difficult to for outsiders and analysts to forecast longerterm earnings but as we look at our plan and how we look at one year out two years out we believe that we have a strategic plan that will get us to the topquartile performance and so our goals and objectives will evolve as the environment evolves and so we manage it tactically and so we will look at individual initiative and how were performing on that initiative versus what we put on the page internally and then what we put on the page externally and show you but just know that our objectives are really guided by looking at topquartile performance jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thanks and then circling back on the growth that youre seeing the new growth opportunities on lending it sounds like thats maybe more taking market share at this point versus broader economic growth but what are you seeing in terms of pricing are you seeing spreads improve are you seeing competitors step back and able to pick up some on an incrementally better spreads or is it really just taking market share and youre willing to be aggressive on pricing to do that at this point kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp so jared theres really two numbers there that we want to talk about jamie talked earlier about just coupons or yields obviously the rate environment is putting some headwinds on that but when we look at the production that were getting today relative to an ftp spread were actually seeing an expansion in our pricing overall and its been fairly sizable in terms of the improvement that weve been able to see and thats i think a function of our ability to pricing risk and uncertainty its our ability from a relationship banking approach to not focus on being the lowcost provider but rather that were adding value and when we add value we can price appropriately for those loans so were very optimistic and i should tell you that when youre in this sort of environment our bankers are doing a great job of evaluating the full relationship and making sure that we are looking at relationship profitability hurdles when were onboarding new clients because its important that were not only growing but were growing profitably so were pleased with the pricing were getting we think theres opportunity to mitigate what jamie talked about earlier in terms of the repricing of the portfolio just through better spreads on new production synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jennifer andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc kessel i have a question on the hotel portfolio you have a slide in the deck on it but just curious as to what to synovus is seeing in the book at the higherend price points of the properties in the portfolio versus the lowerend price points and i know you have it broken down by type of hotel you have but im just kind of curious for more color there kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp jennifer ill let bob go into a little more detail i think in general the book is more dependent on geography those hotels that cater it to the business traveler and major urban market are certainly struggling a little more those that still have some of the vacation traffic some of the driveto locations are doing better in terms of price point bob i dont know if you have that broken out in terms of performance but ill defer to you to see if you do robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey jennifer its bob just a little bit more on that obviously our book is to kessels point in good geographies we feel comfortable about how its spread out around our footprint most of our book is leisure and business related so weve got multiple demand drivers its not isolated to one thats a key point for us we really zero in on that and so when we look at it in markets like for instance charleston south carolina where youve got a high tourismdriven economy as well as business travel so we try to measure those multiple demand drivers and put weightings on what we think the most impact is by market but in terms of price point i mean at the higher end obviously thats a lot of group business a lot of convention business and we dont have as much of that thats a small percentage of our portfolio were primarily spread synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 out among what i would consider sort of mid to upperscale business and leisure travel combination of demand drivers jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc and based on the companys economic recovery assumptions right now would you expect the bulk of your net chargeoffs to be incurred in or later kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah jennifer its a little bit hard to tell but i think youre correct in saying probably into the first or second quarter of is where we would we would expect to see the increase in chargeoffs however i would qualify that by saying a lot of it is going to be stimulus related and of course vaccine related as it relates to covid jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to ask one more on synovus forward if i look at slide and i add up the benefit that youve already kind of ringfenced on the expense side youre already a little over the top end of your range and it feels like you guys can do better than the million benefit when do you officially move that target up andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 so brady its a good point and you pick up on a line item that we wanted to draw everyones attention to is that we believe that through the initiatives we have already put in the execution phase and those that are in play that were at the high end of the range and i think as we move into as jamie mentioned earlier part of this is less about trying to figure out what the absolute number is but rather what its going to take to be a topquartile performer and thats why we put the plus side there to say that as we provide targets we need to flex this expense number to be correlated to what we expect to see on the revenue side so were going to continue to have a structured approach to how we do this this is intentional on how we rolled it out in terms of starting with third party moving to real estate consolidation now on the organizational efficiency and as we shared with you back in the first quarter the number of initiatives that we evaluated during the diagnostic phase were numerous and we decided to move ahead with some and we decided to lay others and so as we move through this on a orderly fashion well continue to pick up new initiatives and well be able to share with you in terms of the overall and quite frankly how much of that is true run rate savings versus cost avoidance because i know your other question is going to be how much of thats in the run rate versus avoidance of future spend but well share more of that as we give out the financial targets in january brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right and then with biden leading the presidential polls hes talking about increasing the corporate tax rate to from any idea if that were to play out how much of an impact that would be for synovus kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah well first there would be a onetime impact to the good on dta front but then it is our estimate and obviously there are a lot of uncertainties with regards to clarity around the details of the plan but its our impression that it would increase our effective tax rate by brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks guys operator our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons with da davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey everyone good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co most of my questions have been asked and answered just one real quick one on ppp forgiveness just curious based on the timing of how quickly or not quickly the sba is getting to process the applications and then actually repay the loans what your sense is that those that remaining origination fees flow through the margin whereas maybe a quarter ago we might have thought a lot of it would account in fourth quarter or maybe do we start shifting more of it into first quarter of at this point andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah kevin let me just give you a few data points there so the million you saw in p3 fee recognition in the third quarter is indicative of what you should expect just without any forgiveness in the fourth quarter so thats a good run rate the million you saw in the second quarter was basically because it was a partial quarter and a lot of its originations were midway through the quarter we have so of our p3 loans qualify for the streamline forgiveness but because theyre smaller its of the balances so its not tremendously significant when you think about it in balance terms and theres about million in fees associated with those loans so for realization of those fees we have to receive the proceeds from the sba so were appreciative of the streamline because anything that makes the process easier on just a shade more than half of our p3 loans were very thankful for that but i would say its highly uncertain when we will receive those proceeds and if i was estimating today i would say its a firstquarter event theres always a possibility it could be in the fourth quarter but i would push it out to the first quarter of kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co all right great thanks guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks kevin kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks kevin operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is anthony elian on for steve kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 good morning anthony anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning i want to go back to the criticized loan increase from the prior quarter you call out that there is million sequential increase tied to hotel loans give a breakout of how much of the million was tied to hotels that are exclusive on business travel and convention center versus vacation and leisure hotels robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah anthony hey this is bob no its a mix we dont have a specific category i would classify that the hotel portfolio in general saw the downgrade it was not targeted to one class of hotel so again most of our hotel is business and leisure travel so thats youre going to get an equal sort of distribution across that and the same is true with markets as well i would continue to emphasize though that these folks were in pretty good shape we had strong equity levels and good debt service coverage as a company and so that helps anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah and a followup on that do you know how occupancy rates have trended over the past quarter specifically for the million of loans that moved into criticized versus occupancy rates for the overall billion hotel exposure you have robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah ph anthony what were seeing really is a little bit of a separation between secondary markets and tertiary markets and in our primary gateway markets such as atlanta and miami weve really seen it in improvement is not the right word but stronger adrs and occupancies in the smaller sort of secondary tertiary markets versus the larger markets so i would call that out to you and we have a number of those in our portfolio specifically to the million that kind of migrated over all of our portfolios experienced all of the hotel portfolio have experienced some stress but nonetheless you did have million or so that moved to rated status thats sort of an equal distribution its not again concentrated in one market or the other or specifically as it relates to adr and occupancy again its all relatively the same just a significant hit to topline revenue andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and i think its another data point anthony ill just point you back to slide where we showed within our portfolio the cash inflows that were seeing on the accommodation portfolio where you have seen last quarter it would have hit a low watermark of reduction in inflows we saw this quarter that it came back into the to range depending on the month so we are seeing improvement across the board but as bob mentioned there is still a yearoveryear decline in terms of occupancy and obviously cash inflows kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp and let me just add one other point there anthony because i know jennifer asked about hotels as well so theres certainly a very strong focus here in the past week everybody on this call plus maybe a dozen others from synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 our credit and evaluation teams participated in a deepdive call on this entire hotel book and i think what came out of it for me and we looked at what was in construction what was seasoned what came out of it for me was really the diversity of that book and bob talked about it but its diversity of geography its diversity of flag strong sponsorship diversity of again very seasoned operators that have been through downturns before certainly not like this so it in many ways although theres certainly concern about that book gives me confidence that our underwriting is good flags are good sponsors are good and even from a dollar concentration not to bring up events of the past but again the company now just doesnt have big single asset real estate concentration so i think there are a number of factors there that although we certainly have concern about that book give us confidence that the book will weather the storm where theres still enough unknown out there that i think bob and his team are doing really good job of evaluating on a propertybyproperty basis anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great and my last question is what was the driver of the other million sequential increase in criticized and classified loans was this mostly fullservice restaurants or was it pretty fragmented thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah anthony it was pretty fragmented there were a couple of larger commercial credits that migrated but all in all i would say it was pretty fragmented anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator our next question comes from brody preston with stephens please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc good morning everyone thank you for the time kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc so i guess maybe just to i know not beat a dead horse but you did mention you did a full deep dive in the hotel book and so you had the rating downgrades in the hotel portfolio but the npl and passthrough ratios are still zero and so i guess when we think about migration from criticized and classified into npl i know some of thats going to hinge on borrowerspecific events but just given the deep dive you all performed could you give us a sense for i guess maybe when you would expect some of that migration to occur and potentially what the size could look like synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah brody this is bob a couple of comments and jamie can talk about the reserve a little bit more if hed like but again that portfolio doesnt necessarily sit in rated status on its way to npl and chargeoffs so i just want to make that point were going to grade the portfolio based on how those assets are performing at this point in time and they all had a significant revenue decrease so when we went in as kessel mentioned deep dive into the portfolio a lot of analytics around recovery rates expected recovery rates the velocity of that recovery et cetera and made those assessments on a portfolio on a loanbyloan basis so youre going to have them in the rated book but we do expect a number of those will slide will move back to past status now again as i cautioned earlier a lot of that depends on where we go over the next quarter or so so i wouldnt want to put it on a pathway to chargeoff or on a pathway to nonaccrual but i would want to tell you that its in a rated status primarily because of the decrease weve seen in revenue that most of the hospitality industry is experiencing as a side note real quick our seasonal hotels this summer saw a fairly significant increase to kevin blairs point earlier weve gotten some of that revenue back so were crawling our way back out of this revenue hole but again it begins to be propertybyproperty and we expect some of them will move back to pass and some of them are not naive enough to think we will have some problems in that portfolio but i think over the next quarter or two wed begin to be able to ringfence even further where those challenges are kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and bob just to add to call your attention back to slide we had originally estimated of that book probably million to million of that book would go into a second round deferral in fact only million of that book has gone into a second round of pi deferrals so to bobs point the risk rating doesnt have to do with necessarily performance with us theyre paying as agreed it has more to do with again the outlook on the industry and certainly the cash flows that are depressed so like bob said theyre not all on a path to npl i hope majority are actually not on path to npl but actually on the path back to higher ratings over time again certainly dependent on the pandemic but i think there was actually i know youre focused on the migration and rightfully so but from our standpoint it was almost a positive surprise as it relates to the performance of that hotel book in the third quarter brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay so it sounds like maybe then looking at that cash flow slide maybe that could give us some indication as to how you all are thinking about criticized and classifieds moving forward because it sounds like that was a key determinant in some of the downgrades currently correct kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah thats correct brody thats just one data point i mean obviously were working with our customers on their own set of pro formas and matching it up quite frankly with what were seeing in our credit analytics on cash flows synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right and then jamie just one on the cd book im sorry if i missed it earlier but could you give us a sense for cds that are repricing i guess in the fourth quarter this year and then how many you would expect how much you have repricing next year as well andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah in the fourth quarter we have and weve put in the deck billion of core deposits core cds in the fourth quarter on top of that theres another million in brokered cds in the fourth quarter and just to give context on rates those are all above a little more than basis points above our cd kind of going on yield now as youve seen in the third quarter and the second quarter its not certain that we will replace those with cds in this environment and so thats what youll see in the near term and then the maturities of higher cost cds decline as we get into and so the opportunity is not as big but when you look at total cd costs at today our time deposit expense is at million we believe we can get back to those prior cycle lows of basis points we believe we can get there by the middle of the next year and so on total deposit cost so thats kind of how we think about the timing when we think about our objectives of getting back to the lows on total deposit cost we think it comes in three different areas and the first is what youre asking about in cds the second is just an overall mix and weve made a lot of progress there weve gotten the mix back to where it was prefcb and that was an early objective for us but we believe there are further opportunities to reduce cost by mix changes and lastly this opportunity is not as big but its important to us as further reduction in the cost of money market deposits brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right great thank you all for taking my questions i appreciate it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you brody operator our next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets please go ahead steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys congrats on the quarter kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah good morning steven synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steve thank you steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just on your cre book just noticed theres an uptick on your office npls and chargeoffs was it just one property or just some color on that kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yes steve that was just a small amount i mean it was not a specific property on the npls well let me back up on office portfolio there is a fairly large credit that we move to nonaccrual one specific credit and that was a bulk of it we had some smaller ones as well that portfolio though as a whole i think continues to perform for us i know theres a lot of eyes on office and certainly theres some longterm trends there that were watching but the other thing thats about our office portfolio that we do like is that its got a lot of medicalrelated mob type of property in it and we feel pretty good about that space so thats a million to million piece of that book so you kind of got to scale it down a little bit but the npl was one larger credit and then just smaller migration in general steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate the color on that and then just a last question on just the synovus forward the million to million revenue initiative whats the breakout between noninterest income versus say net interest income and when do you think we should start seeing some of that trickle in would that be the first quarter of next year kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah well start seeing some in the first quarter steven its hard to say right now between noninterest income and net interest income because you think about the two initiatives weve shared todate pricing for value that really comes from two products it comes from our treasury and payment solutions area which will come in through our analysis charges and that will be fee income but the other part of that is as jamie just talked about the reduction in deposit pricing and that will come in through nii in terms of the commercial analytics workstream that we just kicked off that has three main workstreams the first one is in crosssell and crosssell comes from the treasury products it comes from depository relationships lending relationships so again its going to be mixed across both of the categories it also will reduce the overall attrition of our portfolio which again will come out of both categories and the third its the risk management framework thats going to allow us to be more efficient around renewals and things like that so thats going to show up more on the expense side so its really going to be mixed and as we start to roll out these revenue initiatives well start to finetune the actual benefits and well provide it to you by both nii and noninterest income steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right that would be great if i could just squeeze one more in just curious your unrealized securities gains where does it stand today synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah steven were right at about million in unrealized security gains and at the moment were pleased with the portfolio were not looking to do any future repositioning steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right great thanks again guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you steven operator our next question comes from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hey mike michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you for taking all the time hey just wanted to look at slide where you have the cash flows by month this is really helpful just as you think about the deep dive that youve done and the migration analysis thats been talked about on this call what are the assumptions as we move into the back half of the year and into the winter months for those categories i would think that those cash flows would actually start to move down i just want to make sure that thats captured kind of in your provision and migration thoughts thanks kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah michael its a great point and it would be easy to answer it at the top of the house but what weve actually done is gone industry by industry and provided future forecast based on what the assumed impact would be from a static environment but also as bob mentioned earlier if we were to see the virus spread continue it could have a bigger impact on certain industries and so the important part for us is to leverage it at this granular level to be able to have forecast by industry level there are some as we mentioned in the earlier comments from a k shaped recovery there are certain industries that are performing well and we think will continue to perform well there are others that have rebounded and gotten back to par but there is a potential that there could be a retracing of inflows reducing in the fall and winter months so weve evaluated that so a very longwinded answer to say were doing it at such a granular level it happens at a fourdigit naics code to understand what the recovery looks like and then we do sensitivities around that to understand what the impact would be to the underlying customers cash flow synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp and hey michael this is bob if i could just follow up real quick it also gives us a good data point to go out and meet with our customer with the banker and say hey this is what were seeing in the industry how do your numbers match up with that and also to have a good discussion with them about their expense cuts or how they make them fit into a more compressed revenue stream so good data point for our bankers michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful and maybe just one followup you guys did last year had announced a fair amount of hires in the wealth management area i think a fair amount those were in florida how does that relate into the efforts to drive fee income growth and could we expect some more net adds as we move forward in order to bolster fee income thanks kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp michael as you know last year when we closed on the fcb deal in january we felt there was a opportunity to grow the private wealth management fiduciary and brokerage business as well as our treasury business in south florida and we took the opportunity to make those investments and we feel today that we have the requisite scale to be able to compete were winning in those areas were generating good growth and in this sort of environment where we see some uncertainty as it relates to topline revenue weve taken a pause in terms of broadbased new talent attraction in some of those areas if the return on the initial investment is greater than a year and so what weve done in the short term is weve limited our talent attraction to positions where we feel like theres less than a oneyear earnback now that we have many positions we can continue to invest in there whether its our middle market bankers commercial bankers treasury but we may take a pause into next year before we start adding back those longer payback positions but that shouldnt come at a cost for the topline numbers because were still seeing good growth there and we feel like we have the requisite scale to be meaningful in those markets michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks guys i know the call is running long kessel you mentioned the path on concentrations and i think thats a great point i was also curious if we just kind of think big picture the criticized assets we see today with all the disclosure they still pale in comparison with what happened years ago which i think is important just because i think youve made so much progress since the last credit cycle and youre in a much better position today and it doesnt seem like youre even close to getting back to where it had been in the past synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp chris thanks for the reminder but no i couldnt agree with you more i lived it you lived it and we had big chunky assets we had big chunky concentrations if you even look at the cre concentration now that number and like is cd and land and last cycle that was cre number i guess peaked at and that one particular asset class was so now youre seeing again more diverse again across geography asset class again no big concentrations in the average real estate loan millionish or something like that so and quite frankly a totally different technical difficulty christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for all the information this morning guys its been very helpful kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks chris operator our next question is a followup from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp all right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey thanks for taking my question again just very quickly jamie youve guided for expenses core expenses to stay relatively flat next quarter talk to us i mean if we see some seasonal decline in mortgage banking income in the fourth quarter should we expect some expense offset tied to that or do you expect to use that and deploy that elsewhere in the business andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim great question no as we look at the fourth quarter we do expect expenses kind of to be when you back out any expenses with synovus forward to be flat to be in line with the third quarter and the reason we are expecting commissions and salaries and benefits to decline but were also spending on some initiatives that weve been working on this year in areas specifically in digital and so we are rolling out products were rolling out advancements that weve been working on we havent kind of forgotten our core business and our core evolution in digital and some of those expenses are coming through in the fourth quarter theyre a little bit of an offset to that decline you would see in personnel expense but what i want you to your takeaway to be on expenses is in july we gave guidance that the second half of would have lower expenses than the first half and we were committed to that we believe in that what im telling you right now is just a continuation of that as what we thought but we are also committed to continuing that and when we say topquartile performance when you have this nii outlook in this environment of low rates for longer were fully aware of the need the need to come out of the nie synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 line and as kevin described with synovus forward thats critical for us and so when we look at the first quarter of wed give you the same guidance that we gave you for the second half of and we expect the first half of to be lower than the second half of so i just want your takeaway to be that we are very focused on the expense line were disciplined and you should continue to see a decline in our expenses as we move forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc crystal clear thank you because my followup to kevin was going to be what it means for next year given the focus on what banks can earn from an roe perspective
