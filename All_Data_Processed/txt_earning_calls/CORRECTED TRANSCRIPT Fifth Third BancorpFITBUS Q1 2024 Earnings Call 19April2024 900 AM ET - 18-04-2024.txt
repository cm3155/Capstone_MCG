call 19apr2024 with that let me turn it over to tim timothy n spence chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks matt and good morning everyone at fifth third we believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments but rather by how they navigate challenging ones in that sense the uncertainty we face in the current environment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate that our focus on stability profitability and growth in that order will produce consistently strong some might even say boring financial results this morning we reported earnings per share of or excluding the visa mastercard settlement litigation charges and the additional fdic special assessment all major income statement captions were in line with or better than the guidance that we provided in our january earnings call our adjusted return on equity and return on assets are the highest of all peers who have reported thus far and the most stable when compared to results from the first quarter of we grew period end deposits compared to the prior quarter and generated annualized consumer household growth of punctuated by growth in our southeast markets since we have built more than de novo branches in the southeast as a portfolio they are exceeding our expectations having achieved of their household growth goals and of the deposit goals built into the business cases florida is our topperforming de novo market with deposit dollars at of goal jd power also recently named fifth third number one for retail banking customer satisfaction in the florida market importantly net interest margins improved in the quarter driven by stabilizing deposit costs with interestbearing deposit costs increasing only basis point sequentially consistent with our guidance last year the fourth quarter of marked the low point for nim and we believe the first quarter of will mark the low point for nii while endofperiod loan balances were down compared to the prior quarter we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint with tennessee the carolinas kentucky indiana and texas achieving the strongest results our footprint continues to benefit in an outsized way from federal incentives to bolster investments in domestic manufacturing and energy infrastructure the midwest and southeast have received more investment per capita than other us regions in industries as diverse as multimodal logistics semiconductors batteries and pet food treasury management and wealth and asset management were the strongest contributors to fee income driven by the strategic investments we have been making in both areas treasury management revenue grew year overyear driven by our softwareenabled managed services payments offerings and newline our embedded payments business over onethird of the new treasury management relationships added in the quarter were payments led and had no credit extended wealth and asset management fee revenues grew yearoveryear highlighted by strong growth in fifth third wealth advisors the ria platform we launched in which recently crossed billion in assets under management fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 our credit performance remained stable highlighted by continued strength in our commercial real estate portfolio we posted another quarter of zero net chargeoffs in cre and have less than million of npas in our non owner occupied portfolio while we expect that broader credit trends will continue to normalize our emphasis on client selection and credit discipline helps to ensure that we have a welldiversified portfolio not overly concentrated in any asset class industry or geography expenses are well controlled adjusted for discrete items highlighted in the release expenses declined year overyear driven by savings realized through process automation and our focus on value streams expense discipline is what has allowed us to make the longterm investments in our business necessary to generate superior returns and operating leverage through the cycle looking forward to the rest of the year we remain cautious given the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could materialize depending on how you read the most recent data inflation is either sticky at slowly moving down to or moving back up past geopolitical tensions remain elevated and deficit spending green energy investments and the domestication of supply chains are all inherently inflationary in the mediumterm we believe the best way to manage in uncertain times is to stay liquid stay neutrally positioned and stay broadly diversified while investing with the longterm in mind that is what we intend to do i want to thank our employees your hustle and heart and dedication are why weve been recognized thus far in as one of the worlds most admired companies by fortune one of the best brands for customer service by forbes and one of the worlds most ethical companies by ethisphere thank you for keeping our shareholders customers and communities at the center of everything we do with that ill now turn it over to bryan to provide additional details on our first quarter results and our current outlook for bryan d preston chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks tim and thank you to everyone joining us today our first quarter results were a strong start to the year reflecting our balance sheet strength disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified fee revenue streams we saw new household growth accelerate and new quality relationships in commercial post steady gains for over a year we have highlighted the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment our first quarter results evidenced the strength of our current position which should produce strong and stable returns across a wide range of economic outcomes this approach has served us well as rate cut expectations are pushed out as tim mentioned our profitability remains strong as we have the highest roa and roe and among the best efficiency ratios of our peers that have reported todate in a quarter in which we have outsized seasonal compensation expenses on a yearoveryear basis we were the most stable for both roa and roe and among the most stable for nii and the efficiency ratio our consistent and strong earnings added basis points to cet1 during the quarter inclusive of absorbing basis points impact from the cecl phasein fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 turning to the income statement net interest income for the quarter was billion and consistent with our expectations interestbearing deposit costs were well managed and increased only basis point compared to the prior quarter the balance sheet continues to be reflective of defensive positioning with optionality to navigate the changing economic and interest rate environments net interest margin improved basis point for the quarter increased yields on new production of fixed rate consumer loans and day count benefits contribute to the growth and were partially offset by the deposit balance migration from demand to interestbearing accounts this increase in nim is the first sequential improvement since the fourth quarter of excluding the impacts of security gains and the visa total return swap adjusted noninterest income decreased from a yearago quarter due to lower revenue in commercial banking leasing and mortgage partially offset by strong growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management fees where both saw doubledigit revenue growth over the prior year the securities gains of million reflected the marktomarket impact of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan which is more than offset in compensation expense adjusted noninterest expense decreased compared to the yearago quarter due to our continued focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from our process automation efforts while expenses are down versus the prior year we continue to invest in opening new branches and increased marketing spend to drive household growth adjusted noninterest expense increased sequentially as expected due to seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes in addition to million of expense from the previously mentioned nonqualified deferred compensation plan moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases decreased sequentially average commercial portfolio loans decreased due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers and the average balance impact of last years rwa diet which reduced both total commitments and loan balances during the second half of middle market loans increased during the quarter as we drive for more granularity and our winning private bank relationships as tim discussed we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint periodend commercial revolver utilization was a increase from the prior quarter also driven by middle market average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially due to the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations given the rate environment offset by growth from solar energy installation loans and indirect auto originations average core deposits decreased sequentially driven primarily by normal seasonality within our business decreases in dda balances and cds were partially offset by increases in interest checking by segment average consumer deposits decreased sequentially while both commercial and wealth deposits were flat consumer deposits rebounded towards the end of the quarter to finish slightly higher than at the start of the quarter as tim mentioned we are very pleased with the results of our multiyear southeast branch investments which are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits dda as a percent of core deposits was as of the end of the first quarter compared to in the prior quarter fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 migration of dda balances continued during the first quarter and we expect that trend to carry on in but at a slower pace than in prior quarters we ended the quarter with full category lcr compliance at and our loantocore deposit ratio was the strong funding profile continues to provide us with great flexibility moving to credit asset quality trends remain well behaved and below historical averages the net chargeoff ratio was basis points which was up basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance the ratio of earlystage loan delinquencies to days past due decreased basis points sequentially to bps the npa ratio increased basis points to basis points we have maintained our credit discipline by generating and maintaining granular highquality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class region or industry in consumer our focus remains on lending to homeowners which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies we continue to see the expected normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years from an overall credit risk management perspective we assess forwardlooking client vulnerabilities based on firmspecific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higherforlonger interest rates may cause stress moving to the acl our reserve coverage ratio remained unchanged at and included a million reserve release driven by lower endofperiod loan balances and modest improvements in the economic scenarios we continue to utilize moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings moving to capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of and we continue to believe that is an appropriate nearterm operating level as a reminder at the beginning of the quarter we moved billion of securities to heldtomaturity this represented onequarter of our afs portfolio and was done when the and 10year treasury rates were below the move reduced aoci volatility to capital due to our investment portfolio by around during the first quarter our pro forma cet1 ratio including the aoci impact of the afs securities portfolio is we expect improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that of the afs portfolio is in bullet or lockedout securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations approximately of the aoci related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of and approximately by the end of assuming the forward curve plays out moving to our current outlook we expect full year average total loans to be down compared to consistent with our prior expectations the decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the rwa diet on average balances as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher interest rate environment while we expect full year average total loans to decrease we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of to be up compared to the fourth quarter of with both commercial and consumer balances up low singledigits by the end of we are also assuming commercial revolver utilization to remain stable for the second quarter of we expect average total loan balances to be stable we expect softness in commercial due to uncertainty on the interest rate and economic outlooks to be offset by consumer loan growth which is expected to be up due to solar and auto originations fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 our retail household growth and commercial payments growth remained robust in the first quarter and those outcomes will drive deposit growth in however we are mindful of potential economic and market headwinds from monetary policy therefore we are forecasting fullyear average core deposit growth of only to compared to our growth realized in while we expect dda migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates the pace of migration has declined if rates remain at current levels we expect to see the dda mix dip below during the middle of the year shifting to the income statement given the stabilization in our deposit costs and the benefit we are seeing from the repricing of our fixed rate loan book we continue to expect the full year nii to decrease to and as tim mentioned we expect the nii and nim trough is behind us this outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early april which projected three total cuts however our balance sheet is neutrally positioned so that even with zero cuts in we expect stability in our nii outlook the primary risk to our nii performance would be a reacceleration of deposit competition our forecast also assumes our cash and other shortterm investments which ended the quarter at over billion remained relatively stable throughout the remainder of we expect nii in the second quarter to be stable to up sequentially reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the benefit of our fixed rate loan repricing our current outlook assumes interestbearing deposit costs which were basis points in the first quarter of would increase about basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts we expect adjusted noninterest income to be up to in consistent with our prior guidance reflecting growth in treasury management capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue we expect second quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up to compared to the first quarter largely reflecting higher commercial banking revenue consistent with our prior guidance we expect fullyear adjusted noninterest expense to be up compared to our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the midsingle digits and sales force additions in middle market treasury management and wealth we will also open to new branches in our highergrowth markets and close a similar number of branches in we expect second quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be down approximately compared to the first quarter due to the seasonal compensation and benefits costs in the first quarter in total our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down to and ppnr to decline in the to range this outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around for the full year a modest increase relative to driven by the decrease in nii we continue to expect positive operating leverage in the second half of our outlook for net chargeoffs remains in the basis point to basis point range as credit continues to normalize with second quarter net chargeoffs also in the basis point to basis point range we expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth assuming no change to the economic outlook loan growth and mix is expected to drive a million to million build for the full year with the second quarter build being approximately zero to million fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 as we mentioned last quarter our consistent and strong earnings provides us the flexibility to resume share repurchases of million to million in the second half of including million to million in the third quarter assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current npr in summary with our wellpositioned balance sheet disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue growth we will continue to generate longterm sustainable value for our shareholders customers communities and employees with that let me turn it over to matt to open up the call for qa matt curoe senior directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks bryan before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from mike mayo from wells fargo your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp we can good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey im just trying to figure out how you get away with interestbearing deposit costs going up only basis point quarteroverquarter when the group is like around up and i mean is this sustainable is it due to your tech is it because of your southeast expansion whats your secret here or maybe its just ways to bite you in future quarters thanks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks mike its bryan great question i think one of the things on this front we very early last year made the decision to grow deposits very aggressively we viewed it as a very consistent theme with being focused on the long term focused on stability and quite honestly focused on returns we view the worst case were going to generate some lowcost wholesale funding with no prepayment penalties best case it gave us an opportunity to fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 have million interactions with prospects and customers and we have a lot of confidence in our ability to win relationships when we can get our team in front of our customers and so with that as weve moved into this more stable environment there clearly was some costs as we brought those promo balances in but it gives us an ability to actually manage and recycle interest expense where were able to pulse offers through different markets where we can basically harvest some savings and reintroduce that back into interest expense on new offers and ultimately have a lower net overall cost we just feel like its being very efficient with every dollar were utilizing as i mentioned in the guidance theres certainly some risk that the competition can reaccelerate but it does feel like overall deposit competition did soften at the end of last year and that continued through the first mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just a followup i mean youre expanding share in the southeast you said you went from what to yearoveryear i mean dont you need to price competitively and offer higher rates to gain that share timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp so we definitely took advantage of the fact that we have i think at this point with the investments that have been made down there mike a higher natural share than we did existing market share right so we were able to use the southeast as a mechanism to raise deposits without repricing existing relationships to the same degree that we would have if we were using those rate offers in markets where we had high existing shares i think though whats important is that whats driving the growth in the southeast is the household growth so and those relationships are that vast majority momentum banking relationships which means the core deposit product is a noninterestbearing deposit product so the growth in the southeast when you break it apart the research triangle is like yearoveryear most of the major markets in florida were in the midtohigh teens tampa or broward county and north in southeast florida yearoveryear household growth rates so were gaining share in a way that then allows us to make decisions about whether we want to move more the deposit wallet where obviously rate is part of it or where then we have the opportunity to introduce the feebased businesses on the consumer side of the equation and then in commercial a third of the relationships that we added in treasury managers sic management we mentioned this last quarter were payments led so theyre not driven by deposit rates or credit as the entry point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah operator our next question comes from scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question i was hoping you could spend a moment discussing loan demand trends in more detail kind of soft for the group so you noted some specific states that have generated stronger middle market growth and then maybe within the response if you could also please discuss the outlook for the specialty businesses such as dividend and provide timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah sure happy ill start that one and if need be bryan can fill in here scott so i mean listen i think in general as the commentary weve provided about what we hear from clients is more or less the same they are not pessimistic at that current point but theyre also not leaning forward in the saddle here whether its capital investments or pushing forward on ma opportunities or building inventories or otherwise the prospect we now face with rates being higher for longer definitely will weigh on plans and so i do expect that in general that if were going to get growth we have to get it principally through taking market share and the byproduct of that is that the places where we are expecting to see growth in the second half of the year are the places where we made investments to be able to do it so middle market ci was strong in the first quarter i gave a little bit of a breakout on the markets a driver there in the midwest and the southeast both is the benefit that we get the early benefit that you see from the federal stimulus programs on manufacturing energy transition infrastructure and otherwise because our regions have gotten a disproportionate share of those dollars i think in addition to that we have a much larger sales force in the southeast today than we did three years ago and again the byproduct of that is we will continue to see an accretion of market share attached to those investments as those rms become fully productive texas has been a really nice story for us weve been in texas for a little more than a decade now we have i think its employees there roughly and its a really nice complement to the strong commercial banking team that we built out in california a few years back in terms of expanding the middle market footprint so we expect to see growth in that area and then lastly on the industry vertical side aerospace defense transportation and tmt are the places where the pipelines have were seeing some pickup in the pipelines r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much and then bryan i was hoping you could discuss i know the numbers arent huge here but maybe you could discuss sort of the fluctuations in kind of reserve building versus reserve releasing outlook i know it sounded like from your comments itll be a little reserve build in connection with loan growth but i think you were among the fewer sort of midquarter when youd said maybe a little release so just curious sort of the puts and takes as you see now bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 yeah yeah thanks scott i think the main thing there is two items for the guidance for the rest of the year that is under the assumption that there is no change to the economic outlooks as provided by moodys a big driver of the release this quarter was the economic outlook from moodys to get better so that was a factor we also had endofperiod decrease in loans sequentially so that was an item that drove the release as well next quarter we did guide to a stability on loans so thats why were saying kind of zero to million mix could cause a little bit of build but we do expect endofperiod loan growth in the second half of the year and thats where you get the larger numbers r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay wonderful thank you very much operator next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hello can you hear me timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp we can there we are good morning gerard we couldnt for a minute there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning tim yes no thank you bryan just to pick up on your comments about moodys and the outlook can you share with us how its kind of evolved over the last two or three quarters and what is the current outlook for the us economy in are they still calling for a slowdown or a recession or are they actually in the camp now that were going to have positive real gdp growth for bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp their baseline scenario has had a bit of stability its certainly i dont think it is a significant theres no slowdown in they continue to push out their baseline expectations theyve also improved their downside scenario thats had a little bit of a bigger impact on our reserve calculation but overall theyre now in the camp of the economy continues to be moving well and i dont think that theyre expecting a significant slowdown at this point in gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thank you and then tim coming back to the growth particularly in the commercial side you gave us some very strong numbers of course particularly in your southeast franchise can you take it a little deeper or give us a little more color once you bring on these clients like you mentioned about the customers that came in this quarter based on payments how long does it take to get them to a return that you find a passage or hurdle rate and you guys are happy with it is it a 12month 24month period can you walk us through that kind of waterfall on how you get there how many more products do they need in addition to payments or in addition to a loan to get them to your return levels fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah sure so im going to do payments first and then well start with the loan because payments is easy so the payments clients meet their return thresholds essentially out of the gate gerard because you dont have credit attached which means the capital youre holding is op risk capital and it can take as long as to days to board a client but because of some investments we made fortuitously for us prior to the deposit crisis last spring we can board a client provided that the client is ready to do it in six days now on average and that then allows for a very quick ramp and thats whats supporting the i think its growth in commercial payments fees yearoveryear that current pace a highsingledigit pace has been the goal there for a while and it requires us to get ramped quickly every time we add a new client on the credit side of the equation i think the beauty of the focus that we have on granularity right now is when we move a middle market relationship its generally a single bank relationship and that means the credit comes on it will take a month or two to move payables and receivables and otherwise and to get the payments flowing but you hit the return threshold very quickly i would say generally well within a year on what we do in middle market where we are playing either at the upper end of middle market or in corporate banking the return profile can develop over a longer period because quite often then the ancillary that were focused on is not payments its the capital markets revenues where we lead we get the returns quickly where we are a participant were a participant because we believe we can grow the relationship over time and then there is a strong discipline here to go back through the book every year we do an operating review in every region with every corporate vertical and we have them show us the lowestreturning relationships in their portfolio and theres either a relationship plan that we believe or we exit gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and real quick tim just to follow up on that payments the new customers that you have referenced timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc are those customers that dont have a payments product already or are you taking them from a fintech company or a competitor timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah the disproportionate share of the clients that we are moving with the conventional payments products and managed services are moving from another bank so it would be either they are a business that doesnt run with any leverage and that relationship moves or they make a decision to move their payables or receivables business to fifth third because we can provide a superior service so that is a share shift fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 in the case of the embedded payments businesses we are quite often helping people to build products into their software applications that didnt necessarily exist previously or where they had a smaller bank who had agreed to provide simpler services and theyre looking for somebody whos more robust controls the ability to support higher volumes and then in the case of the work were doing on the technology side now a simpler process to do integration and future product development gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc appreciate all the color thank you tim timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp absolutely operator question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just one question for you tim youve been fairly cautious on the macro outlook the last months has that changed today and the reason im asking is im trying to sync that up with your messaging around buybacks both in terms of the back half and third quarter seemed quite frontfooted so just give us a sense of do you feel better about economic outlook in your markets today than you did or months ago and just broadly as a result of that how are you thinking about capital allocation where should we expect some this level of sort of second half buybacks continuing absent growth reaccelerating next year thanks timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah ebrahim thank you and as you know were big believers in accountability here so i actually asked matt to go back and look through the qa and the scripts from prior quarters to see when we got the first question on higherforlonger rates and you were the one that asked it so in the fourth quarter of earnings call what we said was we thought the market was overly optimistic on how quickly inflation would come down and i dont remember what event it was last december but the comment that i made then was that we thought either the bond market or the equity market were wrong the question was fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 just which one and then if we had to guess it was bonds so i think for certainly know now that the bond market was the side of the trade that was wrong at the beginning of the year the factors that have influenced our more cautious outlook are pretty much exactly the same today as they were the last time we talked about it like we just view the current fiscal and monetary policies to be at odds and that the fiscal side in particular is unsustainable and inflationary over time and the longer it goes on right the more that the fed will need to remain higherforlonger which puts pressure on the long end of the curve and then i think as a knock on to that we know that longer rates stay elevated the more likely it is that youll see adverse consequences either in asset prices or in credit performance the big question is just how long does that take right when does that play out and that is an area where we have low conviction so what we are trying to do and what we will always try to do in low conviction environments is be liquid be neutral and be diversified because historically when you had a change things slowly but suddenly or slowly then suddenly sort of a dynamic plays out in terms of big environmental shifts on capital priorities we do continue to expect to buy back between million and million in shares in the second half of the year our level of confidence in that just comes from the strength of the capital generation of the franchise as bryan and i both mentioned we have the highest roe and the most stable roe if you look at it on a yearoveryear basis of any of our investor peers and that is the basis of the confidence if the environment ends up softening and we dont see the loan growth that will then create a capital opportunity because the capital need to support organic growth wont be there so you do have a buffer here if we do see a turn in the environment and softening in loan growth expectations and if not then we have more than enough capital generation to do million to million in the second half of the year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it that was helpful and to be clear it wasnt a planted question but the other thing that caught my attention you mentioned texas and obviously you mentioned so you think about it fifth third southeast just talk to us remind us in terms of the strategy in texas are we opening a lot of de novo branches there and im assuming theres no nearterm ma but that does open up potential opportunities i guess down the road thanks timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely so we got into texas in when we formed our energy vertical we have deeply experienced folks there who have done a really excellent job and then over the course of the past several years added middle market offices in houston and dallas where we were able to attract very strong talents from trillionaire banks who understand the focus we have on whole relationships and were able to do what i think for us is a little bit unique which is a heavy focus on ci and then the delivery of the valueadded services whether theyre capital markets or payments as opposed to a focus on either loanonly relationships or buyin participations or investor real estate or otherwise that business now also has specialty products so abl equipment leasing coverage it has coverage dedicated treasury management it has wealth and asset management support and then a nonpublic branch office which allows us to do things on the pub funds side what it does not have today is any retail banking presence i wouldnt rule that out but those are very large markets that were talking about here theyre not markets of between half a million and three million people fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 which has been the expansion strategy in the southeast so any effort that we elect to make with branches in those markets will be a thing that we communicate to you in advance because well be talking about committing to branches in a single city in many cases as opposed to what were doing in the southeast right now which is really building to at an individual market level and getting to that top five presence that we know we need to be able to support the primary banking model ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful color thank you operator question comes from john pancari from evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the nii outlook of down to i know the previously your in the last quarter your forecast was forward curve as well and you had five or six cuts in that assumption and now youre sticking to the forward curve so much less so three cuts id say is in the forward curve now however your nii guide has remained intact despite that can you maybe just talk a little bit around the ability to keep that outlook without changing and then what does that mean in terms of your margin forecast and i know you indicated that has bottomed as well as nii now but as you look for the through the year what type of trajectory do you see in the margins thanks bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah john thanks for the question its one where the main thing that i would highlight for you is that we continue to have very strong benefits from the fixed rate asset repricing at this point and you can see this for us you can see that in our actuals numbers yearoveryear our indirect secured consumer business which is primarily our indirect auto business thats up basis points yearoveryear on a billion portfolio so million of annualized benefit in a year where we were actually constraining production in auto because of the rwa diet so those businesses we have those mediumterm fixed rate lending assets whether its the auto business rvmarine whether its solar provide generate a lot of power for us in terms of earnings capacity fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 over the next months well have enough fixed rate assets reprice that will generate million to million plus of annualized nii benefit so even in a higher rate environment and with the curve selling off some that benefit is increasing for us so that is a good outcome for us that helps support and offset some continued migration from a dda perspective as well as some continued forecasted increases in deposit costs overall were not making any assumptions that the deposit environment and the competition and the increasing cost is over but it is definitely moderating from a nim perspective we do expect positive nim from here as well and were only talking about a couple few basis points a quarter trajectory a big wild card on the magnitude of the nim increases just ultimately is where the cash position ends up if we continue to have really strong performance out of our deposit franchise above the to that were guiding to nim will be a little bit lower but nii will be better as a result of that but overall we feel really good about the absolute positioning john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks bryan very helpful and then separately on the credit side npa is up a bit this quarter if you could just give us a little bit of color on what youre seeing in terms of credit migration and maybe by sector were hearing a bit of stress on the transportation sector aviation credit impacted some of the names as well as some banks flagging healthcare so if you could just give us a little bit of color there and maybe also your confidence in your basis point to basis point chargeoff guidance thanks greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yes great thanks great question so the million increase that we saw in npas this quarter million of it was in commercial two names not in the industries that you had indicated we had a retail trade name and a senior living trade name so we are continuing to see stress on that healthcare side specifically in the senior living its not a huge portfolio for us and we think we have our hands around it continue to review that portfolio on a consistent basis so not overly concerned the thing that we have been consistently saying and we continue to see is we just we are not seeing trends by geography by product by industry our issues that have bubbled up have been more episodic and weve been able to deal with those episodic events on a quarterbyquarter basis so i am not expecting to see a linear increase in our npas to your last question i still feel very good about the guidance bryan talked about earlier bps to bps for the year based on again tim mentioned our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very very well the rest of our ci borrowers continue to perform well theyve done a nice job with expense cutting theyve done a nice job passing along pricing theyre operating about as efficiently as weve seen them were taking a cautious view as well not sure where rates are going to go so were not seeing a lot of capex but overall we like the behaviors of our ci portfolio and i think the results of our commercial real estate portfolio speak for themselves john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks for taking my questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp absolutely operator our next question comes from ken usdin from jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you good morning just want to followup with bryan bryan you mentioned the annualized dollar impact from those fixed rate securities and loans i think you said previously that was billion im just wondering if you have an understanding of what you know well be also repricing in and i would assume that would also then be incremental to that annualized benefit you referred to earlier bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thats right we do have a similar amount that will happen in and actually weve been in the range of billion to billion a quarter repricing overall in the portfolio between loans and investment portfolio the investment portfolio has actually been in say a million to million a quarter range that number is actually going to start accelerating later this year as we start to get some maturities on the bullet or lockedout structures were expecting over billion in the fourth quarter and a pace similar to that in so this benefit in the repricing is going to continue and actually pick up a little bit and thats where the higherfor longer environment as long as the front end stays relatively stable because that will help keep deposit costs stable the higher long end will actually help and contribute to higher income over time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then also you mentioned keeping the cash and securities at around the same level can you talk about just how youre preparing for liquidity rules and what that will mean in terms of how you think about the mix of across portfolios and amount of cash you want to keep bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah we are there today for whatever comes out from a liquidity rule perspective so we will not have to make any material changes to the balance sheet compared to what we have today what will happen over time as the loss position on the investment portfolio burns off that will actually increase the liquidity contribution from the investment portfolio so we can take the cash start to take the cash position down also we will start to remix the composition of our investment portfolio to continue to ship more into level securities which will also help us take the cash position down over time so it will be just a natural transition where the balance sheet will get a little bit lighter from a cash and securities perspective as time passes but were very well positioned for any pending liquidity rules ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you bryan fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 operator next question comes from vivek juneja from jpmorgan your line is now open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks tim and bryan a question for you on the southeast how much do you have in deposits there now and what are you doing in terms of consumer side loans where do those stand relative to deposits timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp sure and let me start on the consumer loan side and then bryan will fill in on the detail on deposits so the balance sheet in the southeast on the consumer side for the core banking relationships is a net funding provider for us vivek the sort of general development of a customer relationship is acquire the primary dda via direct marketing and the work that we do around the new branches as we build them the payments products are an important part of primacy so credit card would come after that and then from there you have the episodic opportunities whether thats home equity because theres some improvement going on or mortgage although there obviously hasnt been a lot of that in the environment over the course of the past few years the auto business the dividend solar finance business in particular do have strong production in florida just because of the size of the population relative to the other states where we do business but theyre really unconnected to deposits bryan do you want to talk about the individual markets and deposit balances bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely weve got about overall about billion in deposits in the southeast now about over half of that relates to the consumer franchise so were doing very strong in consumer on that front and as tim mentioned we are it is a net provider of funding we only have about billion worth of loans in the southeast vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and i would imagine most of those are on the commercial side as tim said at this point bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah yes timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc separate question solar i noticed your growth has slowed as youve been indicating any update on what youre thinking in terms of originations loan growth as well as credit fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes well ill start and well get greg to answer on credit we are still number two right we are the number two largest financer in the residential solar market and the byproduct of that is our growth opportunity has as much to do with the market size as it does anything else at this stage and right now with rates being high and with net metering having been rolled back in a couple of places you just have an affordability issue where the cost of purchasing energy off the grid is cheaper than it would be to finance solar installations i think the other dynamic is that as rates rise and this is i think ironically its the same phenomenon in auto is as rates rise the mix of leasedfinanced installation shifts toward leases which means as a lender solar is going to be down i think the estimate from the industry is like this year vivek in terms of total installations youre going to see a more significant decline in the financing volumes so we built our plan around being down yearoveryear and i think in a higherforlonger environment thats probably right if its any softer than that its just going to be a byproduct of this continued dynamic on the leased versus financed and doesnt make sense to offset energy costs on a zero basis with the cost of the equipment thats being installed greg greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp and on the credit side the solar dividend credit losses are performing right as we modeled right around we actually think well run a little bit better for the remainder of this year early volume within the portfolio is seasoning so we saw a little bit of that seasonality this quarter but we feel good about what were seeing and we certainly have more optimistic view for the rest of this year bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and then just on the volume front for originations for solar i know this question came up earlier as well were probably talking closer to billion to billion of originations this year just given the dynamics that tim mentioned earlier vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks operator next question comes from manan gosalia from morgan stanley your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to touch on deposit competition you compete with several of the money center banks in several markets how are you thinking about deposit competition as qt continues as rrp balances continue to decline and the focus shifts back to bank deposits how do you think deposit competition will trend in that environment bryan d preston a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 we think that is certainly a big question for us and for the industry and its one of the items why we highlighted that our nii guidance at this point is less rate environment dependent and more dependent on just the overall level of deposit competition as you mentioned we do compete against the money center banks as well as a lot of regionals across our different markets in the midwest we compete against jpmorgan primarily theyre the number one bank in most of our markets were the number two bank in those markets so we see them and face off against them and obviously in the southeast we deal with bank of america wells and truist so very significant competition in general it does feel like the broader liquidity environment has stabilized versus what we saw midyear last year so even with a little bit of weakness from an overall industry deposit perspective at this point unless something really breaks in the liquidity system were not expecting the significant food fight for cash that happened last year as people were just scrambling to show that they had a stable balance sheet but it does mean that over time that youre likely to see just a potential increase in competition the big counter for this is really going to be whether or not loan growth shows up or not if theres no loan growth for the industry theres not going to be a need for significant competition for deposits and so broadly speaking we think competition probably stays lighter than what we saw last year especially in a stable environment also at a time where we think the whole industry is going to be focused on maintaining profitability so we do think that will moderate some of the pressures but the bottoming of the rrp and potential decreases in bank reserves as qt continues certainly could create some pressure in the medium term manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe a bigger picture question tim in your annual letter you talked about rationalizing the business model in response to the tougher regulatory environment you use the rwa data as an example bigger picture what do you think the evolution of the model for fifth third and other banks of your size will look like going forward maybe theres more partnerships with private credit or theres a pivot to more feebased businesses but in what ways will fifth third look different in five or seven years from now versus today timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah so a few things just on the industry in general and fifth third on that front manan one weve got to find a way to reignite growth in labor productivity right i think thats true of the economy in total but youd see the same thing if you look at the banking sector is despite all the investments that have been made in technology over the course of the past years aside from branch rationalizations you cant really point to a lot of examples where there were big productivity lifts so whether its the cloud platforms were putting in where we should be able to drive more straightthrough processing or the use of ai or otherwise overheads have to come down that is going to be an important point of focus for us through the value streams and through the tech modernization work that were doing fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 i think secondarily there are going to be businesses that regional banks or community banks just dont compete in in the future if there isnt a rationalization of the way that the noncredit wallet is shared and large public companies would be a good example of that space right we did our diet last year we walked away from companies where we were an important lender but we werent getting a fair share of the ancillaries because they were being consumed by the money center banks and thats either going to require the money centers to make larger individual commitments in order to justify the ancillary or its going to require that the treasurers that those companies reallocate the wallet proportionately so and my own view is at least initially youre going to see a shift there i think private credit is going to be an interesting one to watch like there isnt a great track record historically for people growing as fast as private credit is growing and completely avoiding mistakes i also have a hard time figuring out what the comparative advantage is there thats defensible if the model works and i would prefer always since we are a good deposit gathering institution that wed be able if theres good money to be made and the valuations that are being placed on these credit fund providers certainly suggests there is that well be holding those assets on balance sheet so that has not been an immediate point of focus for us and then lastly as weve talked about in the past its hard to imagine that whether its or or its hard to imagine that there are going to be banks and that youre just going to have to see some consolidation and people retreating to places where they have density and focusing on markets where they can neutralize the scale advantages that the large banks have because youre the same size in the area where you compete versus being ranked in every market across the us which is just fundamentally less defensible business strategy manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc very helpful thank you operator next question comes from christopher marinac from janney your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning i just wanted to ask about possible changes on risk grades in criticized and classifieds i know it might be premature to see anything upgraded but just curious on the path of those that you saw and how that may evolve this year greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yes its a good question so again probably not going to be linear its going to be lumpy and has been for us in the past given previous comments i made about episodic more episodic events and the fact that were just not seeing trending by industry by geography and so i would expect it to continue to be lumpy but as i said earlier were still liking the way our ci portfolio is behaving we like our commercial real estate track record an awful lot but with higherforlonger maybe higher forever interest rates were going to continue to see stress and were going to continue to proactively manage the portfolio as we have were not doing deep dives because on an fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 ongoing basis we are stressing the ci portfolio by basis points were getting out ahead of any potential issues but that could lead to some criticized assets a special mention were doing the same thing do something on the commercial real estate side exit stress testing so were taking a look at maturities and were stressing by basis points a forward curve on what that loan looks like at maturity and so if we see weakness there we could see an elevation in criticized assets but of our accruing criticized assets are current right and if you include all nonaccruals we saw current within that portfolio so well see episodic kind of lumpiness for the remainder of the year christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you for that and just a quick followup i mean the loss content ultimately is reflected in the reserves so that would have to change a lot for you to kind of change your guide on reserve overall greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp exactly timothy n spence a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks for that chris i think we dont have any other questions in the queue but wed be remiss if we didnt say congratulations to erika and her family since she wasnt able to join us today before we wrap up our call matt curoe senior directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks tim and thanks ellie
