primary until mainly country reporting european dcb et cetera as we will explain later changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of argentina which is presented in

ceo mr héctor grisi and our cfo mr josé garcía cantera following their presentations we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the qa session operator instructions and with this i will hand over to mr grisi héctor the floor is yours héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you begoña good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us first let me share with you what well be focused on today first i will talk about our q1 results on the context of our strategy second josé will then review our financial performance in greater detail and then i will conclude with some final messages lets start with q1 q1 was another very strong quarter for santander positive contributions for all our businesses demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model we are presenting a profit of billion thats an increase versus q1 in constant euros as begoña said excluding the impact of the temporary levy of revenue paid in spain recorded in full in q1 if you include that this was another record quarter our customer focus and scale are driving profitable growth over the last year we welcomed million new customers and our revenue in q1 increased close to double digit yearonyear in constant euros and thats supported by all global businesses and the regions were executing on one transformation plan which is already supporting efficiency improvements leading to growth in profitability and as a result our efficiency ratio improved ph percentage points yearon year to and net operating income has grown double digit yearonyear for the last eight quarters our return on tangible equity rose basis points yearonyear to even more if we annualize the impact of the temporary levy in spain banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 finally our solid balance sheet with sound capital ratios and robust credit quality it contributed to strong profitable growth and more importantly to shareholder value creation tnav plus dividend per share grew by yearonyear from a combination of higher profit increased shareholder remuneration and fewer shares due to the buyback programs we have and were still executing in the last months we increased tnav by more than billion if we take a quick look at our income statement as we usually do we present growth both in current euros and in constant euros although there were no material differences between them this quarter part of the reason is that for the first time the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to argentina which is in current euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation our pl was strong from top to bottom a strong top number one strong topline performance driven both by nii record fees supported as i said by all the global businesses and regions second revenue grew while cost remained flattish in real terms in line with expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters third we demonstrated the sustainability of our results with growth in net operating income fourth and loan loss provisions continue to normalize as expected finally as i mentioned earlier during the first quarter we recorded a million charge related to the temporary levy in spain which was higher than in excluding this impact profit rose yearonyear implying a growth of in constant euros josé will go into more detail into these points later on as you can see this is a great start of the year and we are well on track to achieve our targets targets that we comfortably reiterate good business dynamic supported high singledigit revenue growth our efficiency ratio improved even as were investing for the future through one transformation and it is already better than our target in cost of risk remained fairly stable in line with our target of keeping it around at the end of the year the fully loaded cet1 ratio remained at in q1 having profitably grown our business organically and accrued distributions in line with our payout and we have absorbed regulatory impacts we are comfortably in line with our target of keeping it above even after basel iii implementation and the rote grew yearon year putting us on track to reach our target of for as you can clearly see were achieving these results backed by the operational leverage provided by one transformation which is improving both revenue and cost the efficiencies we have captured and the impact of our active spread management have already contributed basis points of improvements since our global businesses continued to contribute to the groups profitability and have delivered basis points in efficiency gains our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and smes through our regional coverage model continue to grow well with revenue increasing yearonyear finally our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated basis points in efficiency savings so far our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture million in additional savings in q1 for a total of million since this has been mainly driven by the deployment of gravity by new global agreements with vendors and process optimization in operations and implementation of the new itops sharedservices our business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on profitable growth from the creation of a bestinclass customer experience and operational leverage from our global platforms and common tech this is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our investor day targets banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 this operational leverage is already very evident in our retail and consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios improved close to basis points and basis points yearonyear respectively in cib we are building a worldclass business leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our us franchise without changing the risk profile proof of which is the revenue which grew and reached another quarterly record supported by the good performance in the us and strong client flows wealth continued to grow strongly improving both efficiency and profitability and finally in payments where we are managing more than million cards worldwide we are seeing good activity trends in q1 we had a onetime revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our partners in brazil excluding this impact revenue grew and efficiency remained flat yearonyear despite our investment in deploying our global platforms now lets look at each business in greater detail first our goal in retail is to become the number one bank for our customers which is key to our strategy at the same time our retail business is a great example that demonstrates the benefits we are generating from one transformation as operational leverage has significantly improved the efficiency ratio first we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience for example in spain our new digital onboarding is contributing to increase in net new customer yearonyear while santander key already enables more than million customers to approve transactions securely with a single click using biometrics second we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks increasing automation to free up time of our people to focus on commercial activities as a result dedication of resources to noncommercial activities have dropped by in the last nine months third the deployment of our own global platform continued in q1 and gravity is already operational in spain the uk chile and the us from a financial perspective this is also a great moment for retail we are managing margins very carefully to make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in europe and at the same time benefit from our negative sensitivity to interest rates in south america on top of the strong operational leverage that we are obtaining from one transformation as a result our profit grew yearonyear with the following three things to highlight first doubledigit revenue increase driven by good performance both in nii and fees with all the regions growing yearonyear especially europe and south america second cost under control flat in real terms as the benefits from our transformation in some units are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments and third provisions dropping slightly with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group the execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with rote increasing points to in consumer we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers we offer bestinclass global solutions which are integrated to our partners processes last year we launched a new digital onboarding to pure ph digital players which has been received well because it allows our customers to complete their vehicle acquisition and financing fully online were also progressing well on simplification and automation supporting a basis points decline on our cost to total volumes ratio deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business reducing cost to serve and improving profitability we recently announced the launch of openbank in north america this year which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the us consumer is also delivering operational leverage with net operating income growing by yearonyear driven by the following three elements first an increase in revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 growth mainly in europe and brazil good nii performance and fee growth mainly from insurance second cost dropped in real terms as a result of execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last year in a more complex interest rate environment third provisions increased yearonyear mainly due to the expected cost of risk normalization in the business both in europe and the us though still below the historical averages as well as from impact from volumes and regulation last year we started to prioritize profitability over volumes so we are originating at high rorwas the increase of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to double digit yearonyear by the end of even after the normalization we expect on provisions as you can see we are building a worldclass cib business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to grow profit while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control we are deepening our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the us building on an areas of expertise to accelerate growth across all regions we had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline with markets also performing strongly across the asset classes as a result revenue in cib in the us grew yearonyear also we continued expanding and strengthening our centers of expertise including key industry groups such as energy transition healthcare among others and product teams such as ma and ecm at the same time active capital management continue to support greater origination and high profitability levels our business through cib is capital light very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace yearonyear cib had a good result in q1 with revenue up yearonyear even after the record in q1 in making q1 the best quarter ever for the business almost all of our growth came from customer flows and was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking both in global debt finance and corporate finance additionally were investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and further improve our profitability as for wealth management and insurance we continue our journey to build the best private banking and insurance manager in both europe and the americas first in q1 euromoney once again named us the best private bank in latam and the best international private bank in eight countries second a major driver for growth is wealth is collaboration with other businesses especially retail and cib by capturing network benefits third we are developing global platforms across the three businesses while we digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth one example is the development of our global investment platform which we began in q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of investment across all countries in summary customer experience efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth helping us to maintain our high profitability levels attributable profit grew double digit on the back of strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with a total fee contribution from santander asset management and insurance growing at or close to double digit while cost remain fairly stable in real terms as a result efficiency improved points yearonyear and rote rose points to finally payments we have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain issuing where we manage more than million cards groupwide and merchant acquiring we are gaining market share as we strengthened getnets value proposition for customers through continued product development and greater banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 offering of valueadded services growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where getnet has been mostly rolled out such as chile spain or portugal we continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the pagonxt global platform to leverage on the groups scale around billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform and we expect to double this volume by the end of the year also we have started to deploy plard our global cards platform we have more than debit cards managed already in plard and were starting the migration of the debit portfolio with million cards in dual run in brazil and we have launched a friends and family pilot in chile from a financial performance perspective payments delivered a strong quarter with good underlying revenue trends in both businesses which combined with a positive performance of provision in cards drove year onyear profit growth finally pagonxt ebitda margin reached showing good progress towards reaching our target by which we set our last investor day cost efficiency and capex optimization will continue to drive profitability in the coming quarters as i mentioned in my opening remarks the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our new phase of our shareholder value creation q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and doubledigit shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter as i mentioned earlier rote was if we annualize the spanish bank levy up basis points yearonyear reflecting the high levels of new business profitability earnings per share rose to up yearonyear supported by strong profit generation and the lower number of shares following the buyback programs we have and are still executing finally in the quarter we delivered growth in shareholder value creation reflecting our disciplined capital allocation and the impact of the share buybacks buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders if we include in full the share buyback that is currently underway we have bought back around of our outstanding shares in the last three years providing a return of investment of approximately to our shareholders i leave you now with josé our cfo to go in through more detail on our quarterly financial performance please josé josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor and good morning everyone ill go into more detail on the groups pl and capital performance but let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant in euros and also that the full impact of the argentine peso devaluation last december for the whole year was accounted for in the fourth quarter which introduces some distortions quarteronquarter let me also as héctor has mentioned highlight that we are presenting constant what we present here as constant is constant that means local currency for all countries but argentina argentina is in current by doing that we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation but also by doing this we are lowering the growth rates that show as constant for instance net profit instead of growing with argentina in constant is growing nii is growing instead of fees would be up instead of or total revenue would be increasing instead of banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 so we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking into account the impacts of hyperinflation in argentina but let me go through the main components of the pl as héctor said we are reporting exceptional result for the first quarter we are starting to see the benefits of our transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in retail and consumer and obviously the very positive momentum we are experiencing in both europe and latin america at the same time revenue grew actually if we only look at customer revenue supported by strong nii highest quarterly fee income in our history while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row net operating income grew yearonyear cost of risk remained fairly stable supported by strong labor markets and risk management provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries but we see no asset quality pressures anywhere additionally we had a higher impact from taxes yearonyear driven mainly by stronger performance in brazil where we have higher effective tax rate than the group average and also the fact that the temporary levy in spain is now tax deductible from the corporate tax level the full impact of this tax levy in spain is accounted for in the first quarter and is higher than last year as you can see on the righthand side excluding this impact profit would have increased yearonyear or quarteronquarter and q1 would have been another record high let me break down the pl starting with revenue there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter which made up more than of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the quarter yearonyear revenue increased with all businesses and regions contributing this growth was primarily supported by our retail business which is growing at doubledigit rates with good performance in net interest income and fees across regions and consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses and a strong volume growth in europe and latin america cib also had a great performance as revenue reached an alltime high in the quarter backed by outstanding performance in the us we also delivered doubledigit revenue growth in wealth driven by solid commercial activity in private banking and in asset management payments is also showing very good underlying trends yearonyear as both pagonxt and cards are growing if we exclude the onetime positive impact recorded in brazil in the first quarter of last year as héctor has explained finally at the corporate centre high liquidity buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of fx hedging most of our revenue growth came from nii which continued growing in the quarter particularly in retail and consumer representing of groups nii it went up yearonyear on the back of active price management in retail in europe especially deposits and also in mexico and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates in south america both in retail and consumer and the fact that now forward rate curves in europe are a bit higher in terms of profitability we have improved net interest margin yearonyear even if we exclude argentina this was mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of our of the interest rate environment these gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs which we were able to contain thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in europe and deposit repricing downwards in brazil leading to a notable margin expansion the only country where we saw slight increase in betas in the quarter was the uk going forward we expect the positive momentum in europe to continue we expect to benefit from the interest rate cuts in south america and we expect an improvement in our consumer business throughout the year boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination as a result very good nii outlook for the year banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 in a context of low fee income growth in general because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity we generated record net fee income of billion in the quarter even if we exclude argentina growing strongly quarteronquarter despite the strong seasonality in payments in the fourth quarter we also delivered solid growth yearonyear supported by most of our businesses with retail growing driven mostly by higher activity in brazil outstanding performance in consumer fueled by insurance cib also growing from very high levels in the first quarter of last year especially in the us on the back of our strong dynamics in dcm and customerrelated markets activity wealth also had a great performance particularly in private banking higher volumes in asset management and protection businesses business performance in insurance payments was impacted by the usual seasonality from christmas and black friday in the fourth quarter and the aforementioned onetime positive fee recorded in the first quarter of in brazil in terms of efficiency significant improvement in our ratio to which remains amongst the best in the sector as we have already mentioned structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms of operational leverage especially in retail and consumer as costs remain stable at around billion for the last three four quarters average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint dropping from a year ago to in the fourth quarter and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real terms despite the lagged effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in transformation by business costs remain well under control in retail consumer and wealth which represent of our total cost base however total cost rose reflecting our strategy to reinforce our cib franchise and develop global payments platforms we expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even more evident in the coming quarters and years credit quality as i have mentioned no signs of any pressure in terms of credit quality which remained robust with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint in line with our expectations by global business credit quality remained stable at low levels in the quarter in retail which represents of the groups loan loss provisions with sound underlying trends across the different countries cost of risk improved in spain remained at very low levels in the uk while mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations in consumer which represents around of groups loan loss provisions cost of risk normalized to also in line with our expectations but still below the historical average both in dcb europe and in the us which is still percentage points below levels going forward we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around in as strengths in consumer and mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in retail especially in brazil improving mostly in the second half of the year spain will be stable and in the uk that will also remain at very low levels closing with capital our fullyloaded capital ratio remained at a very comfortable level of backed by strong capital generation and significant riskweighted asset mobilization this quarter we generated basis points organically after having absorbed basis points due to the temporary levy in spain and an increase in risk weighted asset density related to a change in mix we recorded basis points charge for shareholders remuneration in line with our payout there are also points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of cib models which is suspected to be banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 temporary and revert next year with the implementation of basel iii finally there was a 14basispoint positive impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of availableforsale portfolios we continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization capabilities to maximize capital productivity our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on riskweighted assets of in the quarter well above that of our back book and higher than last years we created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment last year we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to billion in riskweighted assets at a cost of capital of around half of that of the new origination our target this year is to do even more thats all from my side héctor over to you héctor blas grisi checa chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé first of all a quick reminder we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with first an strong and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans second we continued improving our profitability investor day target just to remember you was to rote and by growing both profit and profitability sustainably we have been able to deliver value creation and a summary to finish off q1 was another strong quarter supported by a recurrent customer revenue growing high single digit backed by strong performance in all our businesses and regions our structural change to a simpler and more integrated model is driving the efficient improvement and profitable growth which is essentially evident in retail and consumer our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and doubledigit shareholder value creation this is very strong q1 we are confident that we will achieve our targets as well as those we gave on our investor day in supported by first of all its important to acknowledge that is supported by our global businesses and we continue executing on one transformation from a revenue perspective we expect good nii performance in the year this is based on first the positive momentum in europe which will continue at least another quarter second enjoying the benefits from the interest rate cuts in south america and third the significant improvements in consumer boosted by the high new business profitability the benefits of the operational leverage from one transformation program are expected to become even more evident during the rest of the year and well into cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our expectations in a context of strong labor markets as we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities the groups rote improved from in q1 and we expect it to remain at in line with our targets for all in all our tnav plus cash dividend is growing doubledigit well on track to meet our target through the cycle and now we would be happy to take your questions thank you begoña morenés global headinvestor relations banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 thank you héctor and thank you josé we can start the qa session now question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we already have the first question from the line of francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you for taking my questions first is on nii in spain which has surprised positively and we have seen local peers raising guidance so i wonder if you can update on your guidance for and detail the main assumptions behind it and then how big uplift shall we expect in with the current yield curve also connected to this the nii in the corporate centre because the spanish liquidity i understand is ph second rated rate here so you can provide any comment to better assess the combined nii performance of spain and the corporate centre and my second question is on capital after the bps frontloaded in first quarter from basel iv you mentioned in the past that bps left for january so meaning that you are already in line with the pro forma post basel iv i wonder if you can update on this basel iv regulatory impact and other headwinds that we should expect and what do you see your cet1 target in the context also of potential countercyclical buffers thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you francisco let me explain exactly how do we see nii basically going in spain first of all i mean we see really good trends as you can see in retail due to the fact that we had really good growth in clients side basically talk about net new clients in just one year and the trend continues basically very positive during the first quarter as well which we can basically have been able to add new clients its important to say and as i commented that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the second quarter to continue to grow all the different business basically are doing quite well as you can see i mean cib is also performing quite well and the commercial business too and that will basically give you the idea that we expect to have a very strong all along in nii in spain in terms of the corporate centre of what we see there on capital i will ask basically josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa josé to give you the details josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor let me complement héctors comments with the current forward rates as héctor said we see nii still up in the second quarter basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth this would lead to nii banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 in spain yearonyear up low single digits remember that we expected nii in spain to drop a bit yearonyear in relative to with the current level of interest rates and forward rates we see actually nii up in spain yearonyear in the corporate centre the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increased the hedging we always try to hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies so i would expect the nii in the corporate centre to gradually perform better as future fx charges might be lower capital basel iii let me make a general comment before i go into basel iii there are a few elements well several elements of uncertainty to european banks capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters the first is the us has stated that it will not implement frtb for the time being and that they will analyze the proposed basel iii rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts it is therefore very likely that both the frtb and the basel iii rules in the us will be quite different from the initial proposals europe needs to react to this because this will put european banks at a profound competitive disadvantage it is not unlikely though that the commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of frtb beyond january however we dont think crr is going to change in addition the eba needs to publish technical papers to interpret the new directive capital directive the eba mandate is that in aggregate the impact of all these papers must be neutral but that doesnt guarantee that everyone and all these papers will be neutral themselves this is the case for instance in the paper presented for consultation on advanced operational risk model calculation so all in all with the information we have today we maintain our estimate for a very low day one impact of basel iii so on january the impact will be very low to basis points and a fullyloaded impact of between to basis points as we had commented before so all in all we would expect to be above fullyloaded and phase in once basel iii comes into effect countercyclical buffers if in spain in spain we have approximately of our riskweighted assets for the group so any countercyclical buffer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group so if its it will be basis points if its basis points it will be basis points remember however that from the time countercyclical buffers are announced to the time theyre implemented there is a oneyear lag so any announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year most likely will not impact capital requirements or they might impact yearend capital requirements in but not begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please audio gap operator question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst bnp paribas exane hi good morning good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i have two if i may the first one is on fees fee generation in the quarter was quite good when looking to the coming quarters what should we expect should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the good performance of cib and wealth banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 management and insurance linked to this i just wanted to see if there was any kind of oneoff in the fees reported in the us which jumped a lot quarteronquarter the second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and i just wanted to better understand what is the organic generation that you expect i mean as profitability improves i feel that a to bps ph is supposed to be a bit below and you could probably generate a bit more or you would devote that to additional growth of that revenue base thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you ignacio okay in terms of fee generation okay we have as you can see i mean a strong q1 quarteronquarter thats an quarteronquarter growth in retail retail represents basically half of the quarterly growth and is basically solid commercial activity in all the regions and its continued to do so okay you talk about the outstanding performance in cib thats quarteronquarter thats a record revenue this is basically what weve been doing in global transactional banking and there is no oneoffs whatsoever in all the bank and in the us its basically business as usual and client flow from more accounts okay in wealth we have also a very strong recurring activity in private banking also we have higher volumes in asset management and as well in the insurance business we have a see a very good trend and probably we see a very good trend coming from brazil towards the end of the year that could help us out okay consumer growth came mainly from europe okay volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in europe and that shall help us as well for we expect that trend to continue as i told you the fees are growing to reach mid to highsingledigit this is not an official target but i can tell you that this is the trend that we see this is mostly driven by the increase in cib with the connectivity we have on wealth and payments and the growth in customer transactionality and most of the global businesses will experience doubledigit fee growth in as we change our business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account its very important to understand what the model change is about the model change is exactly about that when i was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients this goes more to transactionality and fees than rwa consumption as we used to do in the past okay so this is the basic change that were executing today so youre going to see a much better trend towards that and the most disciplined part on the allocation of rwas with that then i leave the capital question to josé thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa hello ignacio our organic capital generation post dividends is around basis points per quarter we think we can keep riskweighted assets fairly flat throughout the year very very low riskweighted asset consumption because of the asset rotation initiatives that i mentioned so we should be able to have available for capital growth or regulatory headwinds bps per quarter the next three quarters we still expect to basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for intangibles and intangible management so netnet with all of that we still see to capital ratio by year end banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi good morning ive got kind of a couple of followup questions héctor you gave details on the fee performance i just want to circle back to us again and brazil in the us so i know you said theres no oneoffs but is this the run rate we should expect going forward hows the pipeline looking i realize theres no oneoffs but there may be seasonality and can you repeat you mentioned in brazil there was a renegotiation in pagonxt i suspect thats why the fees have been lower but if you could repeat that and then the second question on nii if you think through your comments on spain can i invite you to comment on brazil and uk brazil obviously very very strong it sounds like above the sensitivity you gave what do you expect for the full year can it continue strong and on uk just when do you think it can bottom thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you alvaro yes as i explained you the performance in the us is quite good and look we have a very strong pipeline and if the markets are there and were able to execute everything that we have i think we will have a very good trend but as you know that will all depend i mean how the market basically goes but what i can tell you is that the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the markets helps us sorry to repeat myself looking at in brazil is exactly that you were saying i mean we had a oneoff in payments that we had on the first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself it was a big one million so that basically slowed us a little bit but i see the trend quite well in the sense that i see payments growing nice and i also see that retail is helping us out also in the growth and what i saw towards the end of the year we see that if we continue that trend that should help us well in insurance in retail so that will help us as well okay so i see pretty good trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong in terms of nii in the spain brazil and the uk i could tell you that the indications we gave at the beginning is that with if the rates continue the way they are this is going to give us a i mean first of all see the volume growth that we have in brazil so its important to understand and the volume growth is coming from payments and from retail mainly and nii in spain already josé gave you a very good explanation but i will allow josé to go deep into the detail on that one in terms of the uk let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is i mean as you have been seeing the uk basic will behave the same as our competitors are behaving okay the business as you know is very focused on retail is our core business and we continue to improve there the offering and the user experience and we also are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the corporate segment and wealth to try to diversify away from retail okay nii down in the quarter similar as i said to the other uk banks and all the big ones have the similar trends of ph rotes but were taking actions to improve the nii were doing pricing changes were banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 announced both deposits and lendings in the first quarter and well trying to reduce the betas and to manage them in a much better way and asset mortgage spreads also are improving the uk market so that shall help us towards the next quarter so it wouldnt be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year and then we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that that is basically the main part that youre going to see in the uk and the cost of risk is basically where you will i mean under control and we expect it to be very much there so with that ill ask josé to basically give you more details in terms of spain and brazil nii josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so in brazil nii should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year that means that yearon year we should see mid to high double digits teens not doubledigits teens growth in nii and in the uk the performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter as héctor said weve seen a pickup in volumes margins customer margins were flat quarteronquarter so yearonyear for the full year nii down a little bit midsingledigits something like that with all of these estimates we believe nii for the group should grow quarteronquarter this year so sequentially we should see higher nii every quarter this year and yearonyear customer revenue weve talked about fees and the strong performance in fees so yearonyear customer revenue should be very close to doubledigit in relative to alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc thanks begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you both can we have the next question please operator next question from ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch hi good morning thank you for taking my questions there are two both on the us i dont think ive seen the slide you used to have in last quarter around the kind of aspirational rote target in the us so if you can kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number and what the main drivers and the main initiatives ive seen openbank being launched in the us recently so just a little bit of color basically on how quickly you can get to that and the second one is on the asset quality in the us i mean you used to give some information around ph evs chargeoffs in the past as well i dont think ive seen those actually so forgive me if i missed them but if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the us asset quality delinquencies on the auto businesses are developing from here thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 thank you ignacio okay in terms of the us a particular thing is first of all i mean as you know weve been investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses which is consumer on one side okay which is a business that we have at scale we have also expanded a little money on the cib side to beef up our presence there and were also investing to become our private banking our wealth management capabilities to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for nonus aliens okay so those are the things that were investing in the us to take it to a rote and where i believe is going to be more towards the end of that were going to be able to get there but still were working really hard in order to be able to complete that in terms of the asset quality on the us let me explain exactly how the trend is first of all we still see a strong labor market in the us okay and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do very well what is been happening is that we continue to see the trends in delinquencies above days behave much better than precovid that remember precovid was about we went all the way down to today is more around close to in between mid okay and it continues to be like that so as you can see our cost of risk in the us has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expect it to continue to be like that towards the end of the year we dont see any surprises and the way the portfolio has behaved okay so circa around thats where i see it and now what we have done also is very much focus on profitability were been very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through is quite good and also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in around prime and nearprime okay so you see the portfolio very stable and in that level thank you begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you héctor can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi yes hi good morning so the first question would actually be on the us on the outlook for nii how do you see it evolving throughout the year should we expect pressure to continue or should or could we also see a recovery trend in there and then second question and sorry if you answered it before because im not sure you did on the cost of risk in the uk it remains at quite low levels do you see this picking up throughout the year or should we see the first q level something recurring throughout the year thank you very much héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sorry thank you carlos first of all on the outlook of nii in the us i see it flattish okay lets see how volumes basically turn out and as i explained before it seems we are very much focused on profitability and also in capital allocation i see that is going to be flattish around there okay and in terms of cost of risk in the uk josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa in the uk banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa in the uk sorry the cost of risk in the uk as i told you before when i was explaining alvaro i see the very flattish i mean the guidance is going to be at around to basis points at the most so below sorry below basis points sorry josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa if i may add as ive said we see no asset quality pressures anywhere labor markets are very strong and new employment new job creation is also very strong everywhere so we see really no pressure theres no signs of asset quality deterioration so we could extrapolate what weve seen in recent quarters in the uk we could extrapolate for the rest of the year begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can i have the next question please operator from marta sanchez romero from citi please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you very much good morning my first question is on capital so if the bank of spain were to introduce the ph ccib of bps that is bps for you but that would leave your fullyloaded core equity tier ratio leaving or implying an mda buffer of just about basis points which is pretty low for european standards so do you think that fullyloaded core equity tier ratio target is still the right one in that event the second question is on the uk so the bottom line is now smaller than last year is the shrinking going to continue or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels and just quickly a clarification on a previous question the revenue growth that you are foreseeing is that just reported revenues and is that in constant or current euros thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa let me answer your final question we are estimating almost or around doubledigit revenue growth in constant euros with argentina in current euros obviously in current euros or in euros with argentina in constant maybe higher than that but as i explained we believe this is the best reflection of our underlying performance eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation in argentina héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa in terms of capital what i can tell you is basically that exactly as i said i reiterate that were going to end up the year at around to okay and i really do believe i actually reiterate that were going to be above after basel iii i believe that would be the main point banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah and again the countercyclical buffer will be implemented in a years time so again the capital target is being decided by the board the board might review the capital target once the variables that led to that capital target might change but we are going to be comfortably above basis points mda with our actual capital buffer begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from britta schmidt from autonomous please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst autonomous yeah hi there thanks for taking my questions ive got two questions you sound more optimistic on net interest income in spain uk and brazil but look theres been no change to the official group targets for what is the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus and then secondly you guided to doubledigit customer revenue growth and the group revenue target at mid single digit whats the delta here for thanks josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa first as we saw in the first quarter just the monetary adjustment in argentina in the first quarter was ph just million we have billion monetary position in argentina and inflation was in the first quarter so just that in the first quarter was million thats what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant so there are charges to the pl that obviously we dont control so thats the reason why we havent changed the revenue target for i mean the total revenue target for the group midsingle digits but we believe that the customer revenue growth can approach can be close to double digits héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa britta in terms of the revenue overall as you were saying on nii yes i sound optimistic because im very optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us and i reiterate that were going to meet the rote that we basically have announced onwards i believe that is a it looks good and it looks promising but i reiterate the guidance that we have gave you begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from the line of sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan thanks very much for taking my question so i was just wondering about the flat cost guidance for does it still hold your costs are up in constant euros in current euros so how should we think about that cost guidance that you previously gave and then my second question would be on rate sensitivity basis point change in rates if you could just remind us what that means for spain brazil the uk your or the core markets and also if you have any hedging in place to reduce that rate sensitivity and then my final question would be on slide you say that your new you only got million new customers yearonyear but the investor day a year ago you targeted i think million new customers just like a strategic question maybe it doesnt make a difference if you only have million new customers or does it make a difference and how do you plan to get to the million new customers that you guided for at the investor day a year ago thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sofie let me answer you the last question first i mean what weve been doing here is basically we are cleaning up a lot of our customer bases and even though we are growing quite hard weve been cleaning up that and basically thats at the end whats going to be telling i mean moving up towards the number of customers that we are able to include were going to be working on that and both i mean the growth of customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses in terms of the cost i was basically as i explained you i mean these remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a row okay as you have seen thus plus quarteronquarter if you exclude argentina thats minus because argentina is moving the numbers up and down thats plus yearonyear in real terms and thus the cost to income at around and this is on track to our target of below cost to income and i believe that were going to be able to get to that cost efficiencies are just coming from operating leverage through simplification of products if you see the amount of products that we have simplificated we have different products today were down to and automation which is a very important part and i was just explaining you in the change of model how are we changing the noncommercial ftes to commercial ftes and this is something that in time will help us to control cost much better than weve been doing okay thats basically the efficiency gains if you look at that simplification gave us basis points yearonyear of savings automation is helping us out of product services are now digitally available okay thats percentage points in ph wealth versus december and if i can tell you an example the us have captured million in efficiencies just in q1 alone and thats million since we started the process in and that youre seeing in consumer and retail so its very important that we also remember that one transformation is not a merely costcutting exercise for the creation of the single model and with the several other benefits and this trend will continue on and on helping us out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank okay so to rate the rate is basically to tell you that were going to be in our target below the cost to income for the rest of the year banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa now in terms of rate sensitivity there hasnt been any change in all countries in most countries but europe let me in euros let me explain so in the us its plusminus million in brazil plusminus million in the uk is plusminus million but we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in spain in particular significantly let me make first one particular comment about the uk our structural hedge in the uk is billion with an average duration of billion it was billion in december so billion years average duration and in spain we have been hedging our balance sheet through a combination of different actions basically originating at adjusting the origination buying alco portfolio we now have billion alco in spain at an average duration of between to years at yield and we have been also writing some hedges the result of that is that of the billion riskweighted assets billion billion average earning assets we have in spain is floating is fixed thats significantly higher fixed portion than before so now we have now lower sensitivity to rates in europe héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sorry sofie just to be more precise what i was saying is the cost to income is going to be below okay thats efficiency that we have set for the year and we reiterate that and efficiency this quarter was okay josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so let me just finish the nii sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in spain has been reduced to compared to their sensitivity at we expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as we in the future obviously the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates curve rates interest rates curves have picked up a bit so that has allowed us to earn higher nii and also more time to hedge the positions but again we are gradually hedging our interest rate sensitivity in euros reducing duration through the combination of all these actions that weve taken begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom thank you for taking my questions the first is on your profitability targets your above rote guidance for implies more than billion net profit this year with q1 on track to hit that and with tailwinds in h2 that you indicated in brazil and the uk replicating portfolio and then consumer with lower rates can you be more specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the out of the outlook second question if you could give us a target for group cost in absolute million euros and where do you see them going in banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 finally a quick one on the insurance business the new package banking package improved the treatment of insurance activities inside banks could you consider internalizing this business thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you andrea youre right i mean we are confident that we are going to reach the target that we set in terms of rote for the year and we said correctly in our investor day we said to towards and we are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it but today i reiterate to you that were going to be at the rote that we have set okay in terms of cost what we have said is basically around less than in the terms of cost to income if you see the numbers that we have been weve been very disciplined in terms of and what we have said i mean if you said it is you saw is quarteronquarter is around drop and were going to be very disciplined about it and if you see the operational leverage that we have on the on what i presented on retail youll see that the operational leverage is working like that okay so our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is and i believe that the trend would continue like this so i feel very confident on the way were managing things and i believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flattish in terms of cost the question of insurance is quite a good one we love the business we believe that we have huge upside mainly in markets such as spain and in brazil i could tell you mexico where insurance penetration is quite low so we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems for example we are simplifying products in that sense in a very important way today average by market we have different products per market the idea is basically to go down to basic products that i believe that would help us in order to be much more concentrated for our teams to be able to sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend so thats a huge opportunity as you say the other side of the coin is that we have jvs that in place on the longterm basis mainly in latin america and in spain and portugal and that we will continue to have them over the years because they are long term i would love to internalize that business but unfortunately it is what it is we have the jvs and we need to respect what we have there but as you say these are huge opportunity in that sense not just because of the change and ph sweetness in regulation but also because of the advantages and that we have given the amount of customers that we have and the low penetration in the different markets

analyst rbc europe ltd thank you for taking my questions at the fullyear results you noted that you do not expect any material impact from the fcas review of motor finance in the uk and since then one of the large banks in the uk has made a significant provision in respect to that issue do you expect that no material impact here and are there any numbers you can provide us with how to frame the issue and then secondly weve seen consolidation in the space in the uk from banks looking to improve their return profiles are you already in the uk slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix do you believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you i mean first of all on the uk motor finance issue i mean the resolution of such matters as you know is not possible to predict there are some significant uncertainties that remained with regards to the existence the scope and the timing of any possible outcome there so as a result were not yet in a position to disclose the extent of any potential impact and i dont believe until basically this i understand there is an expert basically running through that so i dont believe that we can give you an idea what i can tell you is that so far were doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have and so far weve been doing better than we expected in terms of consolidation in the uk i dont see that we should play in the consolidation at this point i dont believe that thats a market that we should invest more at this point that would be my view in that sense begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator next question from chris hallam from goldman sachs please go ahead chris hallam q analyst goldman sachs international yeah good morning everybody so two from me so first on basel iv and then on argentina so josé thanks for the color earlier on basel iv i mean i suppose it sounds very possible that frtb gets pushed to align with a revised us timeframe lets say towards july and you mentioned the delegated act provision for frtb here in europe so just within your day one and fully loaded guidance how much is frtb and how much is all the rest of it ie if we only get parts of basel iv on january and then frtb follows on july how much would that change the phasing of the capital headwinds you talked about earlier and then second on argentina so clearly it has quite a distortive effects on the group figures and then theres the associated cost of hedging and its below of group earnings so i just wondered whether youve reassessed your footprint plans in argentina i guess especially in light of the announcement that one of your banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 peers is exiting that market or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make such an exit uneconomic josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so you asked a different question yeah when weve always mentioned basel iii but when we gave the impacts we were including frtb youre right so when we said day one impact of basel iii was basel iii plus frtb frtb isolated is basis points so if frtb gets postponed we will not have this basis point impact on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates i hope this clarifies the matter héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you in terms of argentina i think that we need to leave our options open given whats going on if argentina basically can sustain whats going and we try to be positive about what would happen i dont believe that we have no downside but upside given the situation so there are no plans to do anything at this point and well just wait and we will continue operating our business our business is doing well is very wellstructured is one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration in terms of the transactionality that we have from our clients fee generation so we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on begoña morenés a global headinvestor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator the last question comes from the line of andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes thank you just having a second go asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for the rote implies over billion can you be more specific about what number youre actually targeting and then on the cost the same story im asking for a nominal eurodenominated group cost target for thank you héctor blas grisi checa a chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sufficient numbers and growth rates in the pl to really estimate what we believe is our most likely figure for net income and cost so again for net income sorry return on tangible equity gives you a figure in line with what you are saying around billion north of billion its what its the conclusion of the we agree with that and in terms of costs were looking at a cost growth which is going to be around this year to this year going forward as weve discussed we are targeting flat cost in absolute terms going forward that is going to be difficult obviously we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment we believe that will it is a very ambitious target but thats the internal target we have we havent given any guidance for but what im saying is that long medium term our target is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms we are not there yet in close we think we could be closer or there in but its too early we are still in early sorry banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2024 so well give you this guidance in due course but again our medium longterm objective is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms begoña morenés
