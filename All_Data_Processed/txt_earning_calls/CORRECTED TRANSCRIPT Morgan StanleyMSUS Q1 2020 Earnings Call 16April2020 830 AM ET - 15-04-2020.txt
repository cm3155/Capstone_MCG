morning everyone thank you for joining us we sincerely hope that you your families and your colleagues are all well in these very difficult times were obviously in the middle of a public health crisis one that is devastating to many and along with it the world is being tested from a humanitarian economic and financial perspective as long as the duration and scale of the pandemic and economic slowdown remains uncertain i expect markets will continue to be fragile the resulting stress on the global economy is real and will take time to recover the speed of the actions taken by policymakers has been remarkable central banks acted swiftly around the globe the policies have been thoughtful fiscal stimulus measures and support for small businesses and morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 individuals have been put into place and unlike the global financial crisis the banking system is being leveraged to be a critical part of the solution the federal reserve and other central banks are taking steps to support the economy and we wanted to do our part in march we voluntarily suspended share repurchases we do not expect to restart these repurchases until we have a better understanding of the shape and depth of the economic recovery despite these extremely challenging times our business has held up remarkably well of course we saw an increase in our credit provisions and declines in investment revenues in investment management and there were natural consequences of the market turmoil namely the decline in deferred compensation plan investments and an increase in the amount of prepayment amortization notwithstanding all of this the firm generated billion of revenues and an rotce of importantly the operating plant functioned well the results serve as a testament to the stability of the business mix and the balance we worked diligently to achieve over the last decade ultimately the outlook is much more important than the last couple of months shorter term the decline in asset prices zero interest rates and a potential slowdown in activity levels will have an impact with respect to our strategic objectives which we outlined our goals at the beginning of the year we said we assumed a normal market environment this environment is anything but normal given the circumstances the objectives we laid out would take longer to achieve we will have much greater visibility to discuss these objectives towards the end of this year despite these shortterm challenges our franchise is strong our strategy clear and consistent coming into this we were conservatively positioned and this remains true today let me finish with a few words on how weve responded to this crisis all of our employees and i are working hard to do our best to support our clients and communities weve benefited in this period from robust business planning and from years of investment in our technology infrastructure these teams are doing an unbelievable job in this environment we adapted quickly to a new way of life over of our employees are currently working from home as we continue to serve our clients globally i frequently speak of the strength of morgan stanleys culture and our tenured leadership team during periods of crisis that matters even more our operating committee has worked together in various ways for over a decade nearly all of us were at morgan stanley during the financial crisis the strength of those relationships enabled our team to react to recent events in an expedited coordinated manner allowing us to quickly pivot to a workfrom home model well be equally thoughtful as we think about a path towards returning to work whenever that is deemed safe by health officials and our local governments i could not be prouder of this firm it is during times like this that you take a measure of an organization and my esteem for morgan stanley is now even higher than it was before we will all get through this and we will have all learned a great deal and in the meantime we will continue to do our part for broader society i will now turn the call over to jon to discuss the results of the first quarter in greater detail our perspectives on the outlook given the current environment and then take it back where well both answer your questions thank you jon morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 jonathan pruzan chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you james and good morning in the first quarter firm revenues were billion down sequentially first quarter pbt was billion and eps was resulting in an rotce of our business mix and strategy which emphasizes more durable sources of revenues supported our results during the recent market disruption the quarter was divided into distinct periods january and february were characterized by buoyant risk assets rising markets and engaged clients march proved to be unprecedented as the covid19 virus spread globally and shelterinplace orders became common we saw significant volatility volumes and market dysfunction historical relationships broke down and liquidity dried up clients reacted by reducing risk and raising cash the federal reserve and central banks acted quickly and aggressively with largescale and targeted actions to restore market mechanics and liquidity during this time we remain close to our clients as we all manage the challenges together we moved swiftly to a workfromhome strategy of our employees were working from home by midmarch and 90plus today over this time period volumes rose to times average levels and margin calls rose to times the average levels our technology and operations performed quite well during this period of volatility we also risk managed well with market function and liquidity essentially restored clients are weighing the major factors at play including significant unemployment and economic disruption versus monetary and fiscal actions larger than any others in history during this period the firm extended credit and intermediated trading responding to client needs and supporting open and functioning markets first we extended credit to clients across the firm we financed key transactions to help covidimpacted clients across sectors including transportation health care leisure and consumer among others we also saw approximately billion gross drawdowns billion of new facilities in corporate lending and billion retail commitments we supported our clients by intermediating trading including managing record volumes across voice and mset in march morgan stanley was an underwriter of over billion of corporate and municipal bonds globally additionally we continue to work with clients to access the new federal reserve and treasury programs to meet their financing needs we remain focused on managing our controllable expenses total noninterest expenses were billion for the quarter noncompensation expenses were billion while compensation expenses were billion we tightly managed professional services spend and saw declines in marketing business development given the global shutdown we continued our efforts to reduce dependence on contingent workers leveraging our global in house centers these efforts were more than offset by increases in activityrelated expenses including bce and transaction taxes now to the businesses our institutional securities business reported revenues of billion robust results in sales and trading were offset by markdowns on held for sale loans increased loan loss provision and lower morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 levels of investment banking activity noncompensation expenses increased driven by higher bce and transaction taxes on elevated sales and trading volumes and an acl on unfunded commitments of million in the face of uncertain markets we supported our institutional clients with insightful content our research team generated almost million interactions through written pieces webcasts and conference calls related to covid19 clients remain engaged and since the markets have begun to stabilize their focus has shifted from macro thematic reads to interest in single name securities our worldclass intellectual capital supported by innovative distribution remains a key differentiator when servicing clients investment banking generated revenues of billion the environment weighed on results across products and regions first underwriting activity was impacted as the global shelterinplace actions started to roll across the world followed by significant volatility which dampened ma dialogue and announcements advisory revenues declined sequentially reflecting lower completed ma industry volumes equity underwriting revenues were also impacted declining versus the previous quarter industry activity fell off meaningfully with global ipo volumes declining by over compared to the prior quarter this was partially offset by an increase in accelerated primary offerings and secondary activity as we helped clients across the globe monetize equity stakes fixed income underwriting declined versus the prior quarter while eventdriven activity was limited investment grade bond issuance reached record levels especially in march the spread of covid19 and subsequent market volatility have disrupted deal activity however new issue markets are slowly opening with a few ipos and highyield deals being completed over the last few weeks issuers continue to evaluate financing needs looking to strengthen their balance sheets and raise liquidity we have a strong pipeline across products in equity underwriting and a robust pipeline in investment grade and non investment grade business which are dependent on market access we would expect ipo activity to remain muted and well have to see whether other markets continue to open around the globe equity sales and trading is number one globally and revenues increased sequentially to billion with strong performance across all business lines and particular strength in asia cash results were robust reflecting the nearly increase in global market volumes compared to the prior year derivative revenues increased sequentially as we facilitated client needs during periods of severe market dislocation partially offsetting the results were losses on collateral calls and announcements in europe of interruptions to dividends in march of the euro stocks announced dividend cuts or suspensions in prime brokerage performed well on higher levels of activity partially offset by slightly lower average balances in midfebruary we reached a record level of gross balances only to then see a sharp reversal in late march we reached a recent low in balances as market levels declined and we saw clients significantly degross we enter the second quarter with lower spot balances down close to and a more challenged environment in europe fixed income sales and trading produced revenues of billion increasing from the prior quarter strong client activity in macro and commodities drove robust results multiyear efforts to reshape this business focusing on deepening client penetration increasing velocity of balance sheet and greater trading discipline contributed to the results macro performance was very strong across products particularly over the last weeks of the quarter the business benefited from higher levels of client activity and wider bidoffer spreads micro revenues were more challenged and declined sequentially performance was strong within credit corporates which saw good velocity however this was offset by markdowns on inventory in munis and morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 securitized products which were negatively impacted by the dislocated market and significantly wider spreads strong commodity results were supported by increased client activity driven by meaningful swings in energy and metal prices other sales and trading increased significantly in the quarter this line includes economic hedges on our held for sale loans which benefited from the spread widening this was partially offset by movements related to deferred cash compensation plans which is also recognized in this line losses in investments were driven by a markdown on a commodities investment that was impacted by movements in energy markets and losses within other revenues reflect marktomarket adjustments on held for sale loans and a provision for credit losses for funded held for investment loans looking across other sales and trading and other revenues three main factors drove approximately billion of losses embedded in these two lines first marktomarket losses net of hedges on our billion held for sale portfolio second acl associated with our billion funded hfi portfolio together the acl provision and marktomarket net of hedges accounted for approximately million of the aforementioned loss and third losses from investments associated with employee deferred cashbased compensation plans represent approximately million of the loss now i will give some more color around our cecl provisioning for our billion held for investment loan portfolio provisions for loan losses were million and our march allowance for loans was million this represents an increase versus our day one cecl allowance we had approximately million of chargeoffs or basis points representing our first chargeoffs in the last months and as you can see on page of the financial supplement isg loans were billion billion designated as loans held for investment and million held for sale or fair value held for investment loans were up billion or driven almost entirely by corporate drawdowns of the hfi portfolio billion is corporate billion is commercial real estate and billion are secured lending facilities our allowance for corporate loans is and our allowance for cre is looking at the entire portfolio including the secured lending facilities our total allowance is our secured lending portfolio has attractive lookthrough ltvs and structural protections and we are the sole lender on approximately twothirds of this portfolio now turning to wealth management we reported first quarter revenues of billion and pretax profit of billion the pretax profit margin was in the quarter however results were materially impacted by two negative factors movements in investments associated with employee deferred cashbased compensation plans and prepayment amortization the combined impact was approximately million to revenues and basis points to margin the underlying fundamentals of this business remain quite strong as indicated in our form 10k as of february we had granted approximately billion of deferred compensation obligations for wealth management employees the notional value of these awards is allocated at our employees discretions although subject to quarterly reallocations generally is held in equity investments given the sp index declined in the first quarter the negative revenue impact was elevated while changes in compensation expense related to these investments will generally be offset by changes in revenue there can be some timing differences due to vesting schedules in a given period morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 transactional revenues were million after excluding the impact of dcp transactional revenues was up more than versus prior quarters client activity was extremely strong reflecting high levels of engagement throughout the quarter as clients repositioned portfolios and moved into cash and other shortterm securities today clients hold approximately of assets in cash and shortterm securities asset management revenues increased slightly from the prior quarter higher asset levels at the beginning of the first two months of the quarter helped insulate these revenues from the subsequent market decline in march total client assets of trillion declined sequentially largely on market depreciation positive flows partially offset these lower asset levels we had feebased flows of billion and generated strong net new assets at a pace above our historical run rate highlighting the stability and health of this business we saw improvements in new asset flows over an already strong from both existing and new retail clients our growth strategy is working as clients are seeking professional advice during turbulent times particularly with increased complexity strong loan growth continued in the first quarter lending balances increased versus the prior year to billion driven by tailored and mortgages the loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well we saw elevated margin calls in the quarter with limited losses the mortgage portfolio had 90day plus delinquencies decline slightly to basis points currently weve had borrowers call for forbearance of million in mortgage loans or less than our smallest portfolio the billion tailored book is also performing well with just a handful of special mention loans net interest income declined to million the benefits of higher lending and a billion increase in bdp balances were more than offset by lower interest rates and the resulting higher projected mortgage prepayments in order to understand the impact of lower interest rates its helpful to look at our historical disclosures at year end we disclosed that basis point instantaneous shock to interest rates would reduce nii for the us banks by approximately million over the next months while this disclosure covers both banks some of which relates to isg the vast majority of the nii is in wealth management assuming rates dont rise for the remainder of the year the disclosed figure is broadly representative of the impact of lower rates on wealth nii total expenses were billion the sequential decline was driven by lower compensation expense principally related to the movements in dcprelated investments noncompensation expenses also declined from the fourth quarter reflecting typical seasonality finally we continue to make progress on the integration of solium now part of morgan stanley at work this offering is resonating with corporate clients in the quarter we added over new clients to the platform for stock plan and financial wellness services bringing the total new clients since we announced the acquisition to over investment management reported revenues of million in the first quarter we had extensive engagement with our global clients throughout the quarter and the business continued to see strong net flows despite the challenging environment total aum rose to billion longterm net flows were billion driven by capital being deployed within alternatives and inflows into public equity and fixed income funds morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 our global active concentrated equity strategies continue to outperform their benchmarks total net flows of billion benefited from a significant new longterm client partnership in our liquidity business asset management fees of million declined sequentially higher management fees on higher average aum were more than offset by lower performance fees as a reminder performance fees are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter asset management fees were up versus investment revenues were million in the quarter we saw meaningful markdowns and reversals of carried interest in our real estate infrastructure and pe funds offset by a significant gain in an underlying investment subject to sales restrictions within our asia private equity fund also of note the business was able to see some successful monetizations despite the difficult environment total expenses decreased sequentially largely driven by lower accrued carried interest compensation non compensation expenses also declined on lower bce and professional service expenses turning to the balance sheet total spot assets rose to billion as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients during this challenging period and retail clients sought safety increasing our deposits by billion advanced rwas increased to billion while standardized rwas increased to billion the increase in rwas was driven primarily by increased client trading activity and market volatility as well as lending as a result our advanced common equity tier ratio which is our applicable ratio for the first quarter declined to as a reminder our stress capital buffer will be calculated off of our standardized approach which was in the first quarter we repurchased approximately million shares or billion of common stock and the board declared a dividend per share our tax rate was for the quarter excluding million of intermittent net discrete tax benefits our tax rate will increase in subsequent quarters and we continue to expect our full year tax rate will be approximately to with respect to our intent to acquire etrade the hsr waiting period has expired we filed our application with the federal reserve in march and we will soon file the proxy statement prospectus etrade will hold the shareholder vote this summer and we remain on track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter taken in full we are very pleased with the firms results and stability of the business model we will continue to benefit from the significant repositioning of our balance sheet and business strategy over the last decade our clientdriven model combined with strong capital and liquidity will help deliver relative earnings strength in this uncertain environment but there are several factors that will impact our earnings power in the near term including lower asset values and balances interest rates near zero as well as volatility and economic uncertainty impacting capital markets and ma volumes the second half of the year remains uncertain and the path of the economy will be driven by the time it takes to resolve the health crisis and the impact of the unprecedented fiscal and monetary response with that we will now open the line for questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from christian bolu with autonomous your line is now open christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning james and jon and james its good to hear you are well good to hear that james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thank you christian christian bolu q analyst autonomous research my first question is on rotce for the firm or how to think about downside rotce i mean given you are putting up rotce in what is a very choppy backdrop how should investors now think about the downside case for the firm is a or close to rotce now your bottom line as opposed to a couple years ago when that was your actual longterm target james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well christian let me take a go at it and by the way were all coordinating from different locations here so if jon and i have a little logistical messup forgive us but i can see him on the screen so i think well manage through it were in a most unprecedented environment i mean if youd said three months ago that of our employees would be working from home and the firm would be functioning fine id say that is a test i am not prepared to take because the downside of being wrong on that is massive if youd said that every restaurant around the country would be shut over a twoweek period and remain closed i would say its just not physically possible so were seeing you saw the jobs numbers the applications for unemployment benefits et cetera coming through were in an extraordinary period so listen what i look at is how do the businesses perform underlying in this environment how do we trade through it what was our risk exposure and how do we manage that where do we take hits across the various parts of the plant and youre going to take them whether its in the margin book whether its in the asset management portfolios whether its in the trading businesses and how did all of that look now we didnt have a full quarter of being in absolute crisis we had a half quarter or twothirds of a quarter being in absolute crisis but boy it was an absolute crisis and for this firm to have come through that and generated billion in revenue and thats net of the deferred compensation plans which actually puts us a bit over billion in revenue effectively flat to a year ago i thought was remarkable now maybe its my job to think thats remarkable but i did think it was remarkable i think the stability and breadth of the franchise the diversification clearly showed that we have an underlying sort of backstop of our performance i cant tell you its rotce i know coming into the second quarter well have less market volume we have lower interest rates we have lower asset prices at the moment although we reprice our assets morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 every month well probably have lower noncomp expenses i suspect in the second quarter for a variety of reasons therell be a lot of things going back and forth so is a bottom i dont want to call that now because i just dont know how deep this recession is going to be but given what we went through to produce that felt like a really resilient franchise christian bolu q analyst autonomous research great okay thank you and then my followup maybe just one small one for jon on the deposits you had a pretty big surge in deposits and im trying to just maybe size potential tailwind to funding cost over time so can you remind us how much highcost deposits you still have on the books today maybe what the blended cost of those high cost deposits are versus sort of the sweep deposits that are coming in the door jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure and we did see a surge in deposits in march almost billion in the month of march alone and the balances are up billion for the quarter that was generally a result of people shifting out of equities and going into cash in the wealth system you can see i think on page of the supplement christian the various balances in the banks right now most of that excess deposits is actually sitting in cash you can see we increased our loans a little bit we have increased our securities portfolio a little bit but most of that cash is undeployed and well have to see around the resilience of that our expectations is it will be pretty sticky for a while but again depending on what our clients do as investment options that might come down a bit but it clearly puts us in a much better position i think our bdp which is our cheapest source of deposits which currently have a cost of basis point is now about of the portfolio it was closer to or a little while ago our high cost deposits i think the blend between the cds and some of the other products we have in there is about basis points and so obviously as we can shift more to bdp thatll be significantly beneficial and i think our deposit costs at the end of the quarter were about or basis points and those should come down a little bit as weve just repriced our savings product down in light of the rate environment so i would say we should if we have the opportunity to deploy those deposits into loans well see a benefit there clearly but were going to be cautious and just see how those deposits behave for a little while before we sort of fully deploy them christian bolu q analyst autonomous research fantastic thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning how are you guys doing james glad to see you on the call and good to hear that youre on the mend hope youre feeling better morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thanks brennan appreciate it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc so could you speak a bit maybe jon you gave some color on the billion hfi portfolio which is helpful thanks could you speak to the allocation of that portfolio to some of those sectors that are considered higher risk and if youve seen or received any forbearance requests from any of those borrowers or youre seeing any other any kind of early indications of risk or stress in any of those tied to any of those loans jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure ill take a crack on the allocation the corporate book the vulnerable sectors those are evolving pretty rapidly in terms of which sectors are being hit but clearly energy auto air travel lodging leisure retail on our corporate book which totals about billion we probably have billion or billion to those sectors obviously therell be different caliber in terms of the ratings across those billion or billion you heard me talk about the increase in the reserve for the funded loans we increased for the quarter to bring our reserve level on funded loans up to ph billion there what we did see is the funded loans go up by about billion that billion was actually more skewed to investment grade about of that was investment grade a third of it was bb so very little single b exposure there and a good chunk of the bb in some of what we the new stuff we put out were actually secured and well collateralized so we have taken provisions there weve also as you heard from my comments marked those loans that are held for sale we took about net of our hedges about million of marks on that held for sale portfolio and then the last point i would make is on the forbearance where weve seen some forbearance asks really have been in the commercial real estate book which is only its about billion in total of that is in hotels and retail weve had requests or about billion of loans request forbearance we would expect that number to go up as we get into the may and june payments but at this point its a very highquality portfolio its about ltvs to the top tier borrowers in the real estate business and we have good protection in the asset so the forbearance has mostly been brennan in the cre book right now and then again a little bit in the residential mortgage that i mentioned brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay thanks for all that color really appreciate that jon so another question and my followup you committed james that theres not going to be any risks this year which you can appreciate the idea that this would reassure your employees in an extremely challenging time it makes a commitment to ensure continued health coverage for your employees which is tied to employment in this country and given what were facing you can appreciate and youre a bit hedged because of incentive compensation being a big part but how is that going to come into play with controlling of expenses which is obviously a big factor when youre coming into or likely coming into a recession here and being part of a investment bank obviously expense control becomes big so how do you adjust for those things and what levers are you thinking to pull on the expense side here if the revenue environment continues to get difficult morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey brennan firstly i did say as a ceo you get to make a lot of decisions you get some really really hard ones and you get some others i would put this in one of the easiest decisions ive ever made and by the way it was unanimous call of our operating committee were in 100year crisis right now and its a health crisis first and foremost and the personal anxiety and stress to our employees and to their families can be overwhelming and we thought guaranteeing their jobs this year and getting the support that we had from our employees of them in previous surveys have said theyre proud to work at morgan stanley was a total nobrainer and extremely shareholder friendly the worst possible thing you can show in a crisis is a lack of leadership and support for the people upon whom you depend to get the job done so this was to me a real easy call if it means that our expense ratio is point higher for the year which maybe what it might have been but frankly if we had done a rif you have severance with a rif so the actual economics through the year are not so obvious that theyre shortterm favorable and given that were in a sort of shortterm massive crisis and a longerterm recession of some kind and well talk about that later im sure economically im just not sure it would be good to do a major rif this year but psychologically i think it would be a disaster so we have other things we can do on the expenses and well be doing obviously and noncomp expenses were extremely inflated in the first quarter if you look at transaction taxes if you look at bce the levels of volumes just drove that answer there was no way around it as we get through the year do i think that thats going to hold up no i dont i think our noncomps will be lower through the year and get back to sort of reasonable levels we had reasonable comp accruals for the first quarter we did that because we wanted to be sure that we can get through this year safely and soundly and keep the organization intact as we get better visibility on the rest of the year obviously well be in a better position to judge those accruals but were very comfortable with what we did at this point so weve been reasonably conservative on the expense side meaning we havent tried to chisel the organization the first quarter didnt feel like the right time didnt feel necessary and i think long term even medium term is definitely the right call for our shareholders and ive had great support from them ill just tell you a personal story i had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails on that decision one of them was from a lady who works here in one of our support functions they come home the night before her husband had just been laid off from the small business he was working for she came home theyre both crying and they came in the next morning she got the email from us saying everybodys job is secure and she was just overwhelmed and those kinds of results at a human level and weve got to remember this isnt just about weeks of earnings im much more focused on the integrity of this organization over the next decade or two decades and this kind of thing sets that up so thank you for asking the question its a personal one but its a very important one brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah and thanks for that color james operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey so u wanted to start with a question on the loan loss provision i was hoping you could help us frame following the significant provision build that we saw in isg this quarter just how we should be thinking about the provision trajectory for the remainder of this year and maybe just any additional color you can give on some of the underlying macro assumptions that are embedded within your cecl model today jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure ill try to do that in a coherent way but you certainly know that cecl is model based and its judgment based and theres a lot of things that go into it including multiple scenarios and multiple rankings and ratings against those scenarios as well as the qualitative and quantitative assessment we obviously and just the timing of all of the events we updated our models for what was going on at the time when we got to the end of the quarter in light of what we were seeing and the rapidly changing sort of economic outlook which at this point i would say and james has mentioned it a couple times the range of potential outcomes is the widest ive seen in quite some time in terms of whats going to happen in the future and so we relied heavily on the sort of qualitative and environmental reserve and we looked at the downgrades we looked at what loans we thought would be downgraded the stress draw scenarios we did some loss given default sensitivities we looked at criticized asset trends and we factored all of that into our analysis that ultimately led to the million reserve build on the entire portfolio or a increase from our day one cecl so the economic scenarios are going to impact people differently across the plant as you know the numbers ive just given you are institutional numbers our retail and wealth business had very little reserve build given the performance in that portfolio and the company we obviously dont have any exposure to credit cards or unsecured credit so were slightly a different beast than some of the other folks and well have to see how the economic outlook plays out over the next couple of quarters and next couple of months but clearly in june well have a lot more information to have a better sense of those models but we think the qualitative adjustments that we made are appropriate and brought our reserves to an appropriate level steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks jon quite helpful james maybe a question for you you spoke of some of the risk to the target that you laid out at the start of the year certainly not surprising given the world is using your words is anything but normal but admittedly the message is a bit more cautious than maybe what you conveyed in your march shareholder letter and i was hoping you could speak to what macro and market assumptions are informing your more cautious outlook i know that theres a wide range of outcomes to consider but if we do see a ushaped morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 recovery beginning in is there a path to delivering on some of the targets that you outlined at the start of the year james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yes is the short answer the macro environment that im making the assumptions on i mean take the million job claims this morning for unemployment benefits i mean this is were in a wild period were going to have negative gdp of i dont know so shortterm anybody and i dont mean to disparage anybody but a ceo who stands by their shortterm targets that were set right before this virus hit i dont know what planet theyre on you just you cant predict that over a twoyear period yeah the targets were by the end of and there were the three targets the pretax margin of to the rotce i think of to and the efficiency ratio sure could we be there by the end of on some of these targets definitely but we said and have always said the targets are a normalized environment this is not a normalized environment we will not hit those targets in the second quarter that i can promise you we did not hit them in the first quarter but beyond that lets see how this plays out if the equity markets recover were not going to have mortgage prepay our noncomps are going to be down obviously were affected by where interest rates are and if they change obviously if theres any move upward through thats enormously helpful and things start getting a lot more interesting months from now than they are right now but honestly it would be irresponsible of me to recommit to those targets on this call now on the annual letter that was different what i was saying in the annual letter was these were our targets we laid out in were not ignoring them were not hiding from them theyre what we believe the business will perform at in a normalized environment and it will im totally confident about that but for right now given were dealing with an earnings call and the earnings outlook right now those targets are not achievable in the second quarter they werent achieved in the first quarter and its too early to make the call on what looks like but steven to your question is it possible its absolutely possible is it probable at this point nobody could say that its probable youve got to see what the environment plays out at steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for the helpful context james james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey glen glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi jon maybe one quick cleanup hello there so you mentioned some losses on collateral calls im just curious if it was any meaningful amount that we need to know about and more curious about you lost almost nothing in and maybe just contextualize was this just a sharper drop is it more produced by the quantum systematic trading side im just curious if you can contextualize that in the context of the deleveraging you mentioned jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure and i wouldnt describe some of the losses that we took in the derivatives trading businesses related to the degrossing that we saw going on that actually other than the quantum and the size and the speed and the elevated volumes didnt necessarily lead to those types of outcomes as you obviously saw during the quarter there were significant volatility in certain indices and indexes there were historical relationships that totally broke down and went in different directions so when people single strategy firms struggled if their strategy wasnt working the numbers were not material but we wanted to highlight that it wasnt all perfect throughout the plant as james said youre going to take in businesses where you trade and put with your clients the potential to take losses and so we did take some losses in that area and then obviously the dividend cuts and the dividend business and the dividend season also had an impact and we saw that in that equities number but even despite those losses we still generated billion and were number one in the world glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi great that maybe leads into part b is with the degrossing as being number one in the world having a big prime brokerage platform big hedge fund business and huge quant systematic trading business have you seen any re leveraging or is the amount of leveraging consistent with how we should think about market adjustments or equity adjustments going forward you know what i mean is there a linear relationship with jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley theres not really a linear relationship but i would say we have our equity clients and many of the hedge funds and quants actually performed reasonably well in this environment despite the volatility we have seen some of the gross balances rebound from the lows that we saw in the end of march some of that was just participation as the market went up but we have seen some people get back engaged in the market but its not significantly high off of those low points but it has bounced back a little bit and then obviously the higher market levels helps the gross balances glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 got you and maybe one really quick one at the high level on wealth management when the results first come out youre like oh revenues down you go through some of the adjustments obviously you spelled out the comp thing were revenues actually at record high ex the comp adjustment i know weve got to deal with lower rates and lower asset levels going down but im just trying to get the right context because the flows were good the margins were good all things considered are you still in the that million to million range on a daily basis im just looking for the right big picture your view of wealth management jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley again i think and james can jump in as well but ive mentioned million of negative revenue so that puts the revenues in around billion i dont think thats an actual record but it certainly is a very healthy performance and then an incremental basis points on the that we reported is a very healthy margin and as i discussed the fundamentals of this business are quite good we saw a lot of incremental net new assets into the firm periods of volatility like this generally weve seen our client base look for professional advice theyve consolidated their assets the technology that weve put into place has been really helpful in those initiatives so again the business is fundamentally quite strong well obviously be impacted by the lower asset values and where rates are but fundamentally the business is performing quite well james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah just to add glenn the loan book performed unbelievably well we have basically no problems in a huge margin book all the mortgage book and the other lending that weve done because its a conservative business to people who are clients of ours who we know what their asset and liquidity picture is so that was very pleasing this was a great tough test and it survived it comfortably glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks to both thanks operator thank you our next question comes from michael carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning thanks for taking the questions first i know indiscernible trading you mentioned some of the color around the equity trading balances which makes sense i guess if any significant change on the ficc side just to gauge the outlook there jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley im sorry the outlook on you broke up a little bit i think its our side morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc yeah i was just saying on the equity trading you provided some color around lower balances which i assume it makes sense i was just wondering on the ficc side any significant changes that youve seen in that business to try to gauge like the outlook jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley again its very early in the quarter clients are still engaged theres a lot of policy debate going on theres a lot of debate around the time of the potential end to the health crisis end to the shelterinplaces theres still a lot of activity but volatility is clearly more subdued which will have an impact on the business volumes are still pretty healthy but again its only two weeks into the quarter and pretty hard to speculate whats going to happen over the next couple months michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc all right makes sense and then just as a followup in investment management the investment line tends to be more volatile in this backdrop i think you mentioned some gains that offset marks and accrued reversals can you provide any color on some of those components just so we have maybe a good level to go off of jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure im just trying to find the line the line was million i think and as i mentioned in my remarks we had one very substantial gain that made that line positive similar to the gain we took in the same company that we took the gains from in the fourth quarter but we did see losses across real estate our real estate portfolios as well as some of our infrastructure and private equity funds obviously the gain was larger than the losses its an investment that weve made in a company thats gone public that we have share were restricted from selling our stock but that hopefully will give you some sense of the general sizes of those marks but clearly given what happened with risk assets and asset prices around the globe we did see broadbased markdowns in most of the portfolios michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a clarification so you had million marktomarket losses were those realized or simply just marked tomarket and what were the loans or securities morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure mike it was markedtomarket we still have those loans in the supplement you can see the investment isg loan book is approximately billion i mentioned in my remarks theres about billion that are held for sale the vast majority of the marks came on the relationship book the corporate loans there were also some marks on the secured lending as well the secured lending facilities but we had those million in losses were net of the hedges we have on that relationship portfolio we also had a couple hundred million dollars related to some of the event book which is also held for sale and then very little against the other two portfolios but it was really the relationship portfolio or the corporate portfolio that you see on page a part of that portfolio that you see in the supplement mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just a separate question james good to have you back so i can glad to see youre healthy and so i can also ask you questions on the call but as someone whos had covid now how do you frame the debate between saving lives and saving jobs and the economy i mean what are you advising your clients to do i mean how do you think the economy could come back online and again im glad youre back with us james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well thanks mike appreciate that and im one of the fortunate people to have had it but without having a need to be hospitalized or be in any serious health danger to my lungs so im very grateful for that unfortunately there are many many thousands of people now who do not have that kind of outcome and for them my heart goes out to them i dont think it gives me any special expertise having been through this what i think is well obviously be guided by the cdc and the state and federal authorities my assumption is the right way to do this is to have a staggered people going back to work and to do it either by region or maybe by industry in part but i think separate companies all deciding what to do on their own is a bad idea i think it should be government led and if it starts lets say the first day people are heading back is june then some are on june some june et cetera through the summer so its sort of a staggered approach there are clearly a lot of people whove had the virus who are now apparently not infectious including myself and there are a lot of young folks who do not appear particularly vulnerable to this virus so thats probably where youd start if youre im not a health expert ill leave that in the hands of the health experts at morgan stanley my hope is wed be able to test people to make sure that theyre healthy and clean and wed bring people back in a staggered way as soon as the government lets us do that we currently have of our employees still at work wholl be im sure rotating employees through the rest of the year everybodys got used to working at home as im sure you folks have and were all adjusting so i dont know if that gives you a complete answer but im not really an expert so mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right i guess were all wondering when you can test people and decide if theyre clean and id say were all in the same boat but youre in a better position to rely on the experts again advising all the corporations around the world or so many of them whats your best guess at that morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley of when people can be tested indiscernible mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i mean everybodys doing studies and i know its a very difficult question but ceos need to make decisions about resource allocations et cetera so what are you telling the ceos that you advise james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah but im not advising them on when the various testing for antibodies is going to be coming through i mean thats were really in the hands of the government and i think were all getting the same information i was on the presidents task force call of ceos and im getting the information from white house and theyre getting it from the health authorities and the various pharmaceutical companies i know theres been a lot of work done abbott labs has done abbot has done some work theyre developing some testing and obviously in other parts of the world theyve got faster testing for antibodies so i just hope we get it to the us and its rapidly deployed which i think is what everybody is working on right now so mike im sorry im just not i cant i dont advise ceos on when the testing framework is going to happen guys were going to take just one more question i think because weve run over time and weve given you long answers hopefully theyve been helpful to those who havent had a chance to ask a question i apologize for that but its a fairly dense earnings call as you all appreciate and were here as followups and through sharon yeshaya head of investor relations obviously jon and myself in the days and weeks ahead so well take one more question operator operator thank you our final question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you jon can you share with us i think youd mentioned that coming now at the end of the quarter in wealth management of your customers assets were in cash how does that compare to the start of the year and how do you see them bringing that down over the subsequent months or quarters jonathan pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah thats a great question in terms of how our retail clients are going to reengage with the market so let me just give you just some facts so is cash or cash equivalents including money market and shortterm fixed income securities that number is probably up to points in the last quarter or two and if you look at the totality of the money the trillion the equity allocation has gone from down to and most of thats gone the to points is gone into this cash in shortterm securities how long people feel the need to stay in shortterm and cash i think is going to be a function of what some of the things that weve been talking about on this call which is peoples perspective of when the economy opens up again or the work from home ceases and some of the restaurants and businesses get back into business and morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 people feel more comfortable with the outlook and thats why were also not fully deploying those deposits because again they are generally very sticky but theyre also based on the investment decisions of our clients so were going to see monitor those to make sure that we feel comfortable deploying this operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect disclaimer the information herein is based
