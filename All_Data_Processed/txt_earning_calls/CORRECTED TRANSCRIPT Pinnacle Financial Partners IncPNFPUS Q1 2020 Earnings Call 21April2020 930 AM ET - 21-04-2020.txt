terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you for those of you that have previewed the deck you can see weve got a lot of information to cover today in addition to topics wed ordinarily cover on the call weve got a lot of information on the covid19 pandemic impact and our response to it which i believe has been bold and aggressive weve got color commentary on our adoption of cecl and the subsequent reserve build during the quarter a much more indepth look at the makeup of the segments of loan portfolio that are likely more impacted by the pandemic including a deep dive into bhg and how we expect it to weather the storm and an update on our entry into the atlanta market which we remain excited about so well try to move quickly weve begun every quarterly call for a good number of years with our financial dashboard primarily because it gives a view of our longterm focus and our ability to execute i recognize that this quarter many are focused on the immediate impact of the covid19 pandemic and their responses to it which are obviously the most newsworthy items and honestly in our first graph of this presentation we led with the impacts of the pandemic but the truth is weve been in dialogue with investors over the last number of years regarding items like our ability to attract revenue producers gather lowcost core deposits lowering cost of funds and growing fee income those items that produce longterm shareholder value and so while well cover the covid19 pandemic in great detail it just felt like itd be beneficial to begin where we left off and try to offer brief insights into underlying financial performance despite the impacts of covid as we go through the material hopefully youll be able to see that our decisions and actions have been both bold and aggressive its inconceivable to me that on a personal basis i guess that when is over that it will have been about earnings in i suspect that itll ultimately have been about building the earnings run rate for and so its our intent to execute on the fundamentals that produce longterm shareholder value while adopting a more defensive posture in the early stages of the pandemic in order to best position ourselves for a return to more normal run rates as we head into so for us to ensure a full disclosure we always start with the gaap measures but today i want to move quickly to the nongaap measures because honestly for the most part these are the things that were managing against total revenues were up for the quarter and up yearoveryear i think thats consistent with the large volume of revenue producers weve been adding over the last several years the model works of course fully diluted eps for the quarter was primarily impacted by the elevated provision in the response to the covid pandemic well review that in detail in just a few minutes and then next to the eps chart you can see preprovision net revenue grew at linked quarter north of on an annualized basis and thats a really important measure when considering first of all our ability to weather the storm but secondly our ability to elevate our earnings run rate as we head into loan and deposit volumes were up meaningfully during the quarter in the case of core deposits it was our largest growth quarter ever which i believe is primarily attributable to the internal emphasis that we placed on gathering lowcost core deposits over the last six to nine months no doubt both loans and deposits were aided by clients building liquidity late in the quarter but then our numbers would have suggested that loan volume would have been slightly better than what wed anticipated and in the case of deposits that they would have been very strong and way ahead of our planned expectations pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 in general i thought asset quality was strong both npas and classified assets were flattish net chargeoffs jumped up for us just a little bit in the quarter as most of you know that have followed us for any length of time our chargeoffs are generally lumpy looking at the chart there you can see that of last quarters have been basis points or higher well review that in greater detail shortly but that number was highly impacted by a partial chargeoff with it were going to cover later on the call so thats a 30000foot summary of the quarter i think great performance on the fundamentals coupled with an aggressive reserve build primarily in response to the uncertainty surrounding the covid pandemic let me turn it over to harold to provide a little more color commentary on the quarter before we begin to examine the impacts of the pandemic harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry and good morning everybody loan growth was solid for the quarter endofperiod loans increased by million during the quarter with about million attributable to commercial loan draws with most of those we believe in response to the pandemic by our commercial borrowers as a result organic loan growth we believe was in the million range for the quarter which results in about annualized loan growth which we believe is admirable given the environment now the deposits as terry mentioned it was a big deposit quarter for us endofperiod deposits up almost while core deposits were up over december to that point as many of you know we modified our annual cash incentive plan to incorporate a core deposit growth and rate component first quarter was a great quarter for core deposit growth so as we sit today we think our modification is working well more on incentives later when i talk about expenses next is the usual update to our loan pricing loan spreads held up really well in the first quarter so we were pleased to see that and hopeful spreads will continue to hold in the second quarter impacting first quarter libor loan yields was the absolute spread of libor to fed funds libor spent a lot of time in the first quarter pricing below fed funds and at the beginning of march libor was around basis points less than fed funds since substantially all of our libor loans reprice on the first of the month march was negatively impacted now going into second quarter we finished march at on libor loans with libor well above fed funds were anticipating that libor will work its way south towards fed funds so we will see absolute yield compression and a lot more credits in the second quarter by a modest amount it just depends on how quickly and how far libor moves during the second quarter it seems like its been a long time since we talked about deposit betas we do believe our relationship managers did a bangup job on managing our deposit cost in this rate environment in the negotiated rate bucket weve achieved 117basispoint decline since june of our relationship managers are very much in tune with the rate environment and are prepared to have more discussions with our client base about rate decreases at a minimum we should experience decreases in cd rates for the next couple quarters as repricing occurs all things considered overall deposit rates should be down in the second quarter a busy slide but some important information as we head into the second quarter the nim chart on the top left goes back to and tracks our nim in relation to fed funds target rates we all know weve operated in a zero rate environment before so this is nothing really that new the chart reflects that the longer the zerorate pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 environment lasts the better our nim perform substantially all of us felt we were headed to a zerorate environment and the pandemic put a lot of wind in those sails and certainly increased the speed it took to get there looking forward weve got several issues impacting first quarter nim and that also will impact second quarter nim impacting the gaap nim is obviously purchase accounting which is shown in the chart at the top right we recognized approximately million of discount accretion in the first quarter who knows where itll end up for the full year my bet that itll be less than the million were projecting given payment deferrals in the low rate environment that said we believe we had a solid quarter for nim performance after considering the impact of purchase accounting the bottom charts detail the impact of our hedges as well as hedge unwinds and our recent liquidity build countering the shrinkage in libor spreads that i mentioned earlier will be an increase in revenues from the libor loan core we still have on the balance sheet this floor lasts for about another years as the chart indicates the floor increases in value as libor continues to fall additionally we have about billion in client floors that are currently in the money and will also become more valuable should libor continue to fall weve also added quite a bit of liquidity to our balance sheet and intend to add more in the second quarter as we constantly evaluate the depth of the pandemic weve got ample sources of liquidity to fund our franchise but we believe it was prudent to take on this additional liquidity the liquidity bill will likely result in more net interest income in the second quarter but it will also result in some nim compression we always have the option to reduce this liquidity during as the potential recovery becomes more in view as terry will cover more in detail in a minute our significance is the impact of the ppp lending program ppp was an incredible three or four weeks around here significant resource allocation a lot of blood sweat and tears from some very dedicated pinnacle associates but if it happens like its supposed to happen itll definitely soften the financial blow of the pandemic were also developing a strategy around the main street program currently to identify those borrowers that might be well suited for it but the main street is no ppp now to fee income ill be really brief these were more than million for the quarter up more than of the same quarter in bhg contributed approximately million which was slightly less than we anticipated but more on bankers healthcare group in a second our other fee businesses had a strong first quarter with residential mortgage leading the way up approximately yearoveryear mortgage had a great first quarter correlating not only with drops in longterm rates but also with increases in the number of mortgage originated again great markets are very helpful with this line of business the national residential mortgage market is going through some strategic issues at present so its difficult to speculate on where all this is headed and how it might impact us we just believe we have the best mortgage originators in our markets that are there to help clients get through the current uncertainties wealth management had a big quarter in brokerage as they operated much of the quarter with record market highs and we may be one of the first or one of the few financial institutions in the country that consider trust to be a growth engine all in all a super nice big quarter for us so now briefly on expenses salaries up largely due to the increased personnel this quarter compared to last quarter as the slide indicates were throttling back our hiring focus to focus on atlanta which terry will discuss in pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 a second critical revenue hires around the franchise as well as critical support personnel as weve reduced our hiring plan by in our incentive accrual was at at quarter end as i mentioned previously the deposit component worked well for us in the first quarter we will continue to attract the eps component to see what happens for the rest of the year we concluded was fair right now but suffice to say given the first quarter results many things will have to break our way for that hole last quarter i mentioned that our expense run rate should approximate a midsingledigit increase over to results slight modification with our belief that our expense run rate should now be less than midsingle digits for and i will go into this more on the next slide weve incurred in the first quarter a million lendingrelated costs related to our billing of our offbalance sheet reserves as a result of adopting cecl so were not expecting that amount to repeat next quarter granted the absolute level of our unfunded commitment book will determine that so the length of the pandemic could play a critical part of where we are at the end of the second quarter now cecl ive got a lot to say here so hopefully we can reduce what we have to say about cecl in the future as i know were all weary of this topic at the top of the slide its our rendition of a table that weve seen at several presentations so far this earnings season our day one allowance ended up at basis points which we believe is consistent with the guidance weve been giving for several quarters we had slightly more than million in chargeoffs during the quarter due in large part to the partial chargeoff of a ci credit that was criticized going into the pandemic and with the pandemic finds itself in need of equity support sooner than anticipated which it is working on and our specialized asset folks have a reasonable degree of confidence it will eventually receive one of the first things our entire special assets group did in light of pandemic was spend more than a week as a group going back through every special asset credit and to specifically address the impact of the pandemic on our criticized and classified loans i take great comfort in the judgment of our special assets team this is not their first rodeo later tim will also discuss how we dug in to hotels restaurants et cetera and other segments of our loan portfolio for the quarter chargeoffs ended at basis points and other real estate increased to million as to provision run rate theres obviously much judgment involved in all of this but all other conditions being equal our provision would have been as the table indicates in the million range again you have to assume our net chargeoffs would have been the same had the pandemic not occurred so theres a lot of guess work allowance for loan losses on an applestoapples basis we think would have been in the 69basispoint range at quarter end now as for the covidrelated provision based on model inputs we feel like weve been conservative here weve taken in a lot of relevant inputs and observations and computed allowance that takes into consideration a wide variety of factors we do use a thirdparty source for our economic projections which uses national level forecasting metrics its the same thirdparty we use for asset liability modeling so hopefully there is some synergy advantage by using the same forward metrics there are four economic scenarios in our model ranging from optimistic to baseline pessimistic to severe probably not too dissimilar to the more familiar adverse and severely adverse nomenclature that weve heard about in conference calls thus far pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 in comparison to previous releases by other banks this quarter weve also weighted the various scenarios with the most adverse scenario having a weight of and the optimistic being only the difference is allocated basically evenly between baseline and pessimist as to economic projections anticipated unemployment seems to get a lot of attention with our severe scenario ramping up to more than in the fourth quarter of this year and averaging almost for all of with unemployment returning five years from now in as to gdp our severe model drops gdp by in the third quarter of this year with a rebound to current gdp in i assume all these points to a ushaped recovery our reasonable and supportable period is around months so our calculations are weighted to a time period and then incorporates the front end of the recovery but now they take into account the initial return to some degree of normal back to the top chart on the slide offbalance sheet reserves are not something that anyone routinely talks about in my opinion i believe its accounting on steroids were at million at quarterend after indiscernible and that was a expense this quarter significantly higher than what weve booked in our history that amount represents the anticipated loss content of the unfunded loan portfolio should a loan initially be funded and ultimately results in a loss most of the loans that contributes to this reserve are ci lines of credit which are very short in maturities all things considered were at for their allowance at the end of the quarter plus the million in the offbalance sheet reserve so our allowance for credit loss is around just a quick note cecl has been in development at pinnacle for over three years more money for vendors than i care to acknowledge and likely significantly more expensive is the thousands of hours spent by to key leaders of our firm in getting this standard adopted its an extent to the accounting standard and its been a slog but i want to thank them for hanging in there to get us to this point i wish i could give them a trophy and tell them their work is done but we all know there is always more work coming the big question asked thus far this earnings season that no selfrespecting cfo will answer is move again more provision at the end of the second quarter there are a blooming and assumptions in play here but obviously our indiscernible we will get up the economic projections and we will take the pulse from borrowers throughout and at quarter end organic loan growth the impact of the cares act and other government programs will also have to be considered many factors are outside of our control such as the development of antivirals government imposed restrictions on trade and travel and the information as it come to light with increased testing there is obviously a lot to think about this year our best play right now is to use our models designed largely around economic projections so its very important than an appropriate allowance maybe like i said i think weve been conservative here a million provision is a significant investment for pinnacle into a period of this much uncertainty its more than times our usual provision run rate and results in a allowance of more than times where we were at year end post the great recession the term green shoots became popular theres a lot of discussion today about restarting the economy the ppp the other programs that make up the cares act and whatever comes next has to have a positive impact so we remain optimistic not only about the markets where we operate but in our business model and the associates that work at pinnacle as terry mentioned this management team has taken the operating position to get covid behind as quickly and an effort to gain as much clarity as we can about our run rates going into the second half of and into now some comments on capital first we did bring in about million of subdebt early in the quarter that were hold over issuances from previous mergers we also acquired about million shares of pnfp earlier in the quarter pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 weve now suspended our buyback program until were getting more clarity as to the length and depth of the pandemic were now likely to redeem approximately million of bank subdebt that was previously planned by us for remission in the summer additionally we currently anticipate maintaining our dividend for the foreseeable future lastly we did experience tangible book value accretion during the quarter as our management remains focused on this metric capital ratios did experience some dilution by to basis points this quarter back to levels more consistent with about a year ago our ratios were basically flat with the fourth quarter our participation in the ppp program shouldnt impact regulatory ratios once those funds are fully funded in the second quarter holding company cash is sufficient to carry about six forward quarters of dividends and debt service basically we feel good about our capital obviously credit will be the driving force behind any changes to our previous statements like probably every investment banker listening to this call we too have been conducting stress testing and burndown analysis using multiple scenarios weve incorporated great recession default loss rates historical chargeoff rates and other scenarios its way too early in this crisis to conclude that our cecl and stress testing algorithm is accurate but we walk away from our stress testing feeling very strongly that our capital is strong and we will need to deliver to the common shareholders as a result of this pandemic this slide is new but not inconsistent with what other bankers are talking about on conference calls the ppp program will be significantly impactful in the second quarter and terry will discuss that in just a few seconds all inall its steady as she goes right now the last few weeks have presented us as well as all bankers significant challenges we couldnt be proud of our pinnacle associates our goal today is to support our clients particularly our borrowers all the while making sure that we are making prudent credit decisions we are here to provide our clients the capital they need to weather the storm so that they initially are able to thrive in short order with that i will turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay thanks harold in my view isolating up the inputs of the pandemic q1 was an excellent quarter for us in terms of operating fundamentals but obviously by the end of the quarter we were consumed with protection protecting our associates our clients our communities and our shareholders i cant tell you how proud i am with the leadership and the aggressiveness of our response as you can see on this timeline we actually activated our pandemic response team on january just days after the first known case in the us and the same day that the world health organization declared a global health emergency we had already begun ordering supplies like hand sanitizer before we had the first cases of community spread in the us in early march we began restricting business travel inventorying the personal travel plans of our associates as we headed into the spring break season and communicating with associates and clients about health safety prior to the world health organization declaring the pandemic on march we limited meetings and events to less than almost three days before the cdc suggested limiting groups to no more than and well before subsequent saferathome ordered by a number of governors in our footprint suggested limiting gatherings to less than which of course we complied with on march i believe we were one of the first in our footprint to convert all offices to drivethrough only service and we already had greater than of our back office associates working from home and on march we rolled out a relatively aggressive loan deferral program to assist impacted borrowers ill talk more about that here in just a few minutes i dont want to indiscernible down to each of these actions since so many are by now are commonplace but it does appear to me that our team was very bold in its decision making pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 and on the front end of virtually all these issues and all these things that impacted associates and clients have worked well and we believe our clients and our associates have been well protected in fact to date we have only three confirmed cases firmwide two in nashville one in memphis as it relates to protecting our clients i will say we aggressively reached out to clients to make them aware of our payment deferral program in general our deferrals were structured for days with an ability to defer a second 90day should the borrower needed with no further documentation as you can see on the left of this slide total deferred balances were roughly and not surprisingly were concentrated in hotels restaurants and entertainment as ive listened to other banks discuss their loan deferral utilization some resort to use it as sparingly as possible im not being critical of that approach at all in fact i see some merit to it but i do want to be clear our approach has been the opposite its been our intent to help our clients build as much liquidity as possible not knowing the depth and duration of the pullback and of course as harold mentioned a minute ago the most impactful for clients and most concerning effort for our firm over the last three weeks has been the payroll protection program sic paycheck protection program we received roughly billion in indiscernible and were ultimately able to gain sba approval for billion in other words we were able to distribute roughly of the requested funds another way to look at it is based on the asset sales of our firm compared to commercial banking assets indiscernible and assuming an even distribution of the billion in funding weve been expecting to distribute about million which means we have roughly times to times our share and while im incredibly proud of that and all the associates of this firm many of them worked literally night and day it killed me to think that any of our clients who deserved funding were unable to receive it and so you might guess weve been lobbying congress to do the right thing and refund the program by at least another billion in events like this its our desire to see every one of our eligible clients get the funding they need and we will dedicate ourselves to that effort regardless of the time and effort required to do it just a couple of other observations on ppp obviously the largest number of loan terms come from the smallest businesses almost times more smaller loans approved then in the sba in other words in the sbas lowest tier less than we had times more of those than the ones that were in its highest tier greater than million the fee income associated with volume of loans that were part of sbas first billion allocation translates to roughly million in fees expecting to be recognized over the short life of those loans as a meaningful down payment on the special loan loss provision we made this quarter its our intent to be successful on a second round assuming congress does indeed refund the program we have as many applications yet to be processed as we processed in the first stage let me say that the payroll protection program sic paycheck protection program because it was significantly underfunded in terms of demand put most banks across the country in a position of underserving clients very few basic customers were able to get all indiscernible that they received processed before funding ran out and of course if youre one of those businesses that didnt get fund then you might feel like your bank let you down regardless of how herculean your effort was to get you approved by the sba but we took just under applications as i mentioned totaling billion we were able to get billion of that approved our associates i think in addition to the funding we had to get our clients prepared beforehand on very short notice we had people working night and day to get into position to advice and help clients prepare to apply once indiscernible were committed by the sba on april it was our genuine desire to get all of our clients to the front of the queue recognizing the banks would likely be fighting for a scarce resource its hard to believe that we had to stand up two new systems in a matter of days to process all that volume understanding the clients pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 that didnt get funded are frustrated and we are too honestly our associates have continued to work all week in trying to ensure that those unfunded apps are in a position to launch in the event that congress does what it should and authorizes additional funding despite frustration by those who didnt get funded for the most part our work to advice and look after our clients stood out versus our competitors and has been widely praised among our clients and in the local press as obvious by now there are probably no borrows that wont be impacted in some way by covid19 but clearly there are segments like restaurants hotels retail and entertainment that will be mostly impacted so ive asked tim huestis our chief credit officer to provide a deeper dive into those segments of our portfolio timothy h huestis chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you terry good morning everyone from a credit perspective first quarter was a continuation of our solid performance for metrics such as past due nonperforming assets classified assets and net chargeoffs as terry mentioned earlier we did experience an increase in net chargeoffs from basis points to basis points despite it was a result of the single credit that was directly impacted by covid19 absent this credit our net chargeoffs would have been in line with prior quarters a little more color on that credit later before i get into the following slides first a few overarching comments what we dont know with certainty is when economic conditions will stabilize it largely depends on flattening of the pandemic curve how high unemployment ultimately gets and whether the rebound is vshaped or a ushaped curve what we are focused on today are those things we can do to help our borrowers and minimize loan defaults our strategy is the best offense is a good defense youve all heard terry saying many times over we hire experienced bankers who know their clients this same principle has always held true as weve grown our credit team we only hire very experienced senior credit officers we currently have senior credit officers and their average tenure is years or years of experience we have our senior credit officers paired with our financial advisors in virtually every one of our markets credit officers go on client and prospect calls with the financial advisor further rounding our credit discipline is our credit analyst team of employees our credit analysts have an average of years of experience we believe our largely unique line credit model of partnering experienced credit talent right next to the banker will serve us well during these difficult times heres what pinnacle is doing to address covid19 challenge payment deferral program we provided deferrals for real estate ci loans and consumers approximately of billion we proactively reached out to clients in the most impacted areas of our loan book with a streamlined plus payment deferrals our commercial and credit clients requesting a second 90day extension we built a survey tool to help us collect and quickly aggregate client responses to targeted questions we believe payment deferrals are a prudent step to help our clients bridge to the other side of covid19 second paycheck protection program loans as you just heard terry discussed pinnacle received approximately applications totaling roughly billion and obtained sba approval on just north of applications totaling roughly billion we believe the additional dollars to our clients will help them better endure this difficult time third enhanced monitoring strategies to produce more real time data on severely impacted segments in the next few slides well briefly cover several of the segments most obviously impacted by covid but to take it a step further to understand covids impact we partnered with an industry research firm ibisworld ibis and a team from pinnacle work to stratify the risk in our ci book we took ibis time proven historical quantitative metrics of industry risk level and trended risk and combined a qualitative overlay for impact of social distancing the product results in a stratification of our ci book in the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 categories of highest risk high risk medium low and lowest we will use this stratification to target time and energy where the risk levels are highest pinnacle has continued its approach of building a wellbalanced and granular portfolio weve maintained our discipline regarding conservative house limits for cre segments as well as for ci subsegments the pie chart on the right provides a quick glance of these segments that have been most impacted by covid and the relative size to our loan book here is an attempt to be as transparent as possible regarding our loans to the hospitality industry pinnacles approach of lending to hotel sponsors that are wellcapitalized and have a long history of successfully operating hotels has served us well as of march we only had one nonperforming hotel loan of million this was an sba loan that was originated by a bank that bank of north carolina had acquired years ago a few items on the page to draw your attention to include weighted average ltv of we have provided payment deferrals for to provide them flexibility hospitality projects are financed largely in our geographic footprint many of our hotel sponsors are also very large depositors with pinnacle the second slide on our hotel book will provide detail about our largest hotel loans some noteworthy details to point out includes of our exposure is in the hilton marriott holiday inn and hyatt we believe this brand identity will better position our portfolio as you can see in the chart a conservative ltv position on these largest most of our hotel exposure is limited service no luxury or resort brands only of our hospitality book has loan maturities in and hopefully by these dates the impact of covid will have subsided this next slide provides details of our restaurant book it groups together exposure to commercial real estate developers who lease the restaurants as well as loans directly to restaurant operators some noteworthy points include this segment is less than of our loan book top two exposures are to wellknown public companies who operate restaurants these two relationships represent of our loans to restaurant operators the listing on the far right illustrates approximately of our total retail book is being repaid from revenues of seven well known restaurant brands as of april of our book has executed payment deferrals this slide will provide details of our retail loan book it groups together exposure to commercial real estate developers who lease to retail stores as well as clients that operate a retail business together they represent of our loan book some noteworthy details include no mall exposure for our cre term loans only are greater than million of these are the groceryanchored centers are singletenant averaging just million to tenants like dollar general tractor supply 7eleven and bojangles these are open its a very granular book with over loans averaging just million for our preconstruction loans only six loans is greater than million of these six two are groceryanchored of our construction loans are built to suit this slide will provide some details into our entertainment music loan book we have one financial advisor that specializes in lending to the music publishing industry very experienced with a strong contact throughout the industry most of our loans are in the music publishing space to finance the acquisition of song catalogs each catalog is made up of thousands of wellseasoned diversified songs that are stable from an earnings standpoint average ltv is under revenue from the catalog is generated primarily from terrestrial radio and streaming to a lesser degree sync revenues generated from songs in catalogs used in film tv commercials and general licensing only a limited amount of covid pressure to revenue is anticipated people will continue to stream their music but fewer bars and restaurants playing songs may impact sync revenue all loans have appropriate loan covenants that permit close monitoring notably pinnacle had only one loan to a concert promoter it was a million line with very modest usage pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 as we discussed on the call we had one partial chargeoff in the first quarter of the music team has just one talent agency borrowing client due to cash liquidity reasons this relationship was transferred to our special assets team during late fourth quarter significant equity was injected into the company in early thus curing the liquidity issue then covid hit and revenues completely stopped we do not anticipate any further loss on this credit now let me turn it over to harold to provide some similar analysis for bhg and our belief about how they will weather the storm harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks tim ive got several charts here on bhg but i want to move pretty quickly through on the top left chart on this slide weve shown on several occasion our opinion here is that there had been no loosening but actual tightening of credit standards of bhg and through all of that volume growth has been exceptional the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily from the early years of the firm they continue to refine their scorecards and increase the quality of the borrowing base as you know theyve ramped up sophistication on credit process as they continue to aim at segments that have high quality borrowers perhaps the bottom right chart may be the most powerful chart i have to offer related to bhgs steadily improving credit quality as you look at the losses by vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination thus pointing towards a lower loss percentage over the life of the borrowing base recent pandemicrelated events will likely cause these lines to point upward but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is much higher than the borrowing base from just a few years ago now more on historical chargeoffs and reserve build these are for loans that they sold to their network of community banks the green bars show that currently theyve got about billion in credit with banks who acquired their loans the orange lines shows the annual loss rate while the blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks they have been keeping the recourse reserve for substitution losses in the mid to high over the last few years basically constant with annual losses as many of you know bhg has been building their balance sheet thus maintaining more loans on their books with the eventual goal of issuing debt securities collateralized by these balance sheet loans two positives from the strategy in our view bhg is creating a more diversified revenue stream and as well as creating another funding source with the securitization technique that said during the first quarter bhg elected to pull back on this strategy and sell more loans through the auction platform thus generating more revenue during the first quarter by doing this they generated enough revenue to significantly increase their recourse reserve for substitutions as we all entered into this period of uncertainty their business flows have provided them the ability to increase this reserve and strengthen their balance sheet accordingly additionally bhg has taken a slightly more conservative position with their outbound sales and marketing they are purposefully electing to aim for higher fico scores of origination and have backed away from adding any new professional classifications to their portfolio at this time they will continue to evaluate this position for the foreseeable future agree this is some fairly granular data but i feel its really important were not going to go through it in detail but in our opinion it points to a welldiversified loan portfolio and maybe helps to eliminate some preconceived pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 notions that bhg is just for dentists dentists are absolutely important to their franchise accounting for of the outstandings at the bottom of the chart details the nonmedical book that is growing faster than the medical book and represents approximately of total outstanding as of april total deferrals represented about of the total book that number is currently running at about so it slowed somewhat these deferrals require the cooperation of the purchasing banks so bhg has been working with not only the borrowers but the banks to help the borrowers get through the impact of the pandemic quick indiscernible for a comment after talking to our friends at bankers healthcare group dentists lead the group as expected with a deferral rate as bhg talks to these dentists they have learned that dentists are indiscernible emergency only and rescheduling nonemergency procedures into the summer as a result dentists will need to start working six days a week upon restart to keep up with the demand i dont know about you but going to the dentist is not my idea of fun but given the current economic climate im going to look forward to seeing my dentist on a saturday in the very near future weve shown this slide before the green bars on the left chart represent originations and have ramped up with more loans being funded which is the result of enhanced analytics and more sophisticated marketing platforms with the tailwind of pushing more to the auction platform the first quarter was a great quarter for origination but also business flows are strong and should help us hit as we head into the second quarter the blue bars are the loans on which gain on sales has been recorded as these loans are placed with bankers with gain on sale revenues being generated the blue bars increased in the first quarter as a result of their decision to send more loans offbalance sheet and build reserves a wise play from pinnacles perspective the gold bars represent the loans held by bhg on its balance sheet for which bhg will collect interest income once some idea of restart occurs and the credit markets appear more liquid then the offbalance sheet strategy will be back on the radar for me the auction platform is probably the most valuable component of bhgs unique gainonsale model currently they have more than banks in their network their funding platform is alive and well and very liquid spreads during the first quarter were some of the best in the history of bhg as you know bhgs management spends a great deal of time on making sure that this platform has ample liquidity and is ready to acquire their loans at a competitive price lastly for bankers healthcare group they have pulled back their estimates by a modest amount for who knows where all this is going to end up with so much uncertainty as it stands currently their business flows going into the second quarter are strong as there are borrowers out there needing their products their marketing engine is aimed right at higher quality borrowers in the traditional segments that bhg has significant experience underwriting the auction platform is liquid and spreads have been a positive for bankers healthcare group pinnacle remains excited about our investment and look forward to watching our friends at bhg step up during this time with that ill turn it back over to terry to wrap up m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks harold quickly as you heard from harold earlier and in concert with generally adopting a more defensive stance were substantially slowing our recruitment efforts for the foreseeable future along with the associated expense bill with the exception of atlanta we continue to believe that the opportunity in atlanta is a onceinageneration opportunity and that the timing is perfect indirect impacts of covid like social distancing may slow our efforts to some extent but our early associate client recruiting success brings confidence that we should stress ahead pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 and here is why we see so much opportunity in atlanta this is greenwich data from both the nashville and atlanta markets it covers businesses with annual revenues from million to million in each the crosshairs represent the mean performance across each market and so aboveaverage performers are above the horizontal line and to the right of vertical line it seems to me that the goal for any institution would be to get to the northeast corner as quickly as possible as you can see what weve done in nashville is just that we have capitalized on relatively poor client satisfaction among clients in the largest banks in the market those that had the most share had the greatest vulnerability clearly in nashville we were at the right place at the right time now looking at this chart on the right atlanta i want to make two observations first of all youll notice that the crosshair in atlanta would suggest that the average satisfaction among clients of the banks in atlanta is generally less strong than in nashville in other words atlanta is less competitive in terms of client satisfaction and more importantly all of these banks who possess the vast majority of all the business clients in atlanta suffer from belowaverage percentage of their service quality and are therefore extremely vulnerable it is really an unusual opportunity as a reminder this is the slide we covered last time to paint a picture of our aspirations there im not going to review it again since nothing has really changed and as you can see here weve been extremely busy over the last to weeks having pretty well hired our complete initial team as mentioned earlier i do expect that things like social distancing may slow our recruiting timeline down just a little bit but at this point were extremely encouraged by the response of the bankers that were talking to there so in an effort to summarize our plan indiscernible forward in this pandemic in general its our intent to move from offense to defense to slow our investment in growth until the storm has been weathered and the environment once again is conducive to our unusual ability to take share from the larger unwieldy banks that said i believe our aggressive addition of revenue producers over the last two years who are still in the earlier stages of consolidating their client base should result in ongoing growth albeit at a slower pace and hopefully put us in a position to elevate earnings run rate faster than figures well continue to manage those things that produce longterm shareholder value and will remain in a more defensive posture until we more clearly see the depth the duration of pandemic and its impacts specifically weve increased liquidity and well continue to do so in q2 weve elevated our loan loss allowance meaningfully and although we dont tend to cut our dividend at this time were still in a capital preservation mode suspending our share buyback and retaining subdebt we had previously intended to redeem for the first time since the great recession were slowing our recruitment and hiring in an effort to avoid the expense build that goes with it and to enable us to maximize preprovision net revenue as an important aspect of our defensive posture operator well stop there and take questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions and our first question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc you mentioned several higher atrisk portfolios and you guys indiscernible in detail on all of those as well as bhg indiscernible of your restaurant borrowers have requested deferrals today can you talk about what indiscernible those other atrisk portfolios timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc jennifer this is tim huestis your question was breaking up was the question we had of payment deferrals from restaurants are you asking what the deferral rates on the other segments have been jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc yes exactly timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc okay well i dont have all the different segments with deferral rates we did include the deferral rates for these key categories but i dont have at my fingertips for the different segments m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jennifer as you can see there the deferral rates are concentrated in those segments given that youve got an overall deferral rate as opposed to the very elevated deferral rate in those highly impacted segments jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay can you just talk about what youre expecting in terms of reopening throughout your footprint i know the tennessee governor has already said some things pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question thank you i think were encouraged by an offensive posture it looks like in the state of tennessee the state of georgia and the state of south carolina those are principal operating areas for our firm rob mccabe the chairman and my partner here is active on the governor of tennessees task force to figure out how to reopen the economy as well as the city of nashville and so it looks to me that youre going to get an aggressive restart in as i said tennessee georgia and south carolina so what does that mean to us i think that you ought to anticipate that well work not dissimilar to the presidents guidelines in other words he sort of guided a phased reopening and its based on watching the decline in cases and then stepping back in and escalating the progress from there i think youll see the same thing in the state i know in the state of tennessee that will be the case rapid opening in some places slower opening in the more urban markets like davidson county shelby county hamilton county knox county and sullivan county which is up in the tricities so again pinnacle will then be a function of that and well do the same thing we sort of expect a phased reopening as you know weve kept fundamentally all our branch offices open with drivethru service so theres not a huge service degradation but we will stagger into it weve already begun building the reopening kits and well use shields for tellers protective shields not dissimilar to what youve seen in some of the grocery stores there are a variety of things that are included in the supply kits were building to actually reopen on a fullservice basis jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you very much m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator all right our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody thanks for all the great detail really appreciate indiscernible i guess maybe first just on the provision from what youve seen so far in april is there any expectation for changing the weightings of your different scenarios or is that too early to tell indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah jared this is harold i dont think well be changing any weightings just right now well probably be getting new economic projections in short order and then well likely get some more before the end of the quarter so well just have to see what those look like but as it sits right now were not planning on changing those weightings pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and does the provision fully impact incentive comp indiscernible as we see higher provisions fully flowing through to the incentive comp or is there some type of indiscernible provision harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah im not sure i got all of your question were having a bad connection today but i think you were trying to ask a question around our provision and how it correlates with incentives is that correct jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats correct yes harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right yeah currently the way the incentive program would work is we dont have any kind of exception for provision expense so that would be included in our however we openly end up with respect to the incentive plan jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then on bhg when we look at the recourse obligation thats on slide should we think of that its similar to a provision or is that forwardlooking and based on our expectations or is it based on actual indiscernible come through or requests that have already come through harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the recourse accrual is there for eventual substitution risks that may exist in the portfolio thats been sold to the community banks and so it is forwardlooking and it is an attempt to kind of cover whatever that future loss rate may be as of march jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then to bhg loans that are in deferral do those qualify for substitution or indiscernible besides just a covid deferral harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc now bhg is not subject to cecl so those community bank loans would be included with a kind of a similar thought process as the loans that are on bhgs balance sheet so the way bhg looks at the loans offbalance sheet is the way they look at it for loans on balance sheet there is substitution risk and thats just nearly in lieu of credit risk for the loans that are on the balance sheet did i answer your question jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc jared i think m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jared this is terry i think if i understand the question the loans that are on banks balance sheet and therefore subject to the substitution will be treated like any other bank assets meaning that the deferral is looked at differently for those loans than it would have been in the past as it relates to tdrs and therefore substitution put back in all those kinds of things jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you that was exactly what i was looking for thanks operator okay and our next question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler please go ahead stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah yeah it is yeah im not sure everybodys questions are breaking up so its not you its something between you and us stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay ill try to keep it shorter then can you talk about how much an additional line utilization might be outstanding kind of what the line utilization is today and expectations for further indiscernible pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think that number is somewhere in the billion range as far as whats left to draw m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold i think as it relates to line utilization it goes up and down and today the line utilization would be at a lower level than it was at quarterend harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah in april the million has come back to like million m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah is that what youre asking stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co that is thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co going back to bhg i know you gave the recourse reserve do you have a level of reserve what bhg actually has on balance sheet harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah that reserve is about i think stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and i guess why would that be so much lower than indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc its about why would it be less than the reserve for the stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co replacement pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc the substitution for the community bank loans is that a question stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think what theyre doing is theyre looking at it first of all theres prepayment losses in the offbalance sheet book so if a loan prepays they reimburse the bank for that and with the loans on balance sheet they havent recognized any prepayment gain so that runs about a stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so thats how stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and last thing from me hopefully you can hear this indiscernible i know you gave a lot of detail how you think the reserve is justified but with your exposure to ci can you talk a little bit about just kind of the loss expectations in ci the basis points you said in the presentation kind of maybe you indiscernible or what the assumptions are indiscernible potentially just to frame up the reserve that might explain a little bit lower than indiscernible on a percentage basis harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right well ive been looking at several disclosures regarding cecl and the allocation of reserves i think by and large the credit card books are getting closer to to im not seeing many disclosures yet on what the ci and the cre books may be allocated for our peers but as it sits right now the way our models work that the allocation for ci i think you mentioned seems to be reasonable stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for the color i appreciate it operator thank you our next question is from the line of tyler stafford with stephens please go ahead tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 hey good morning guys can you hear me okay m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we can hear you youre loud and clear tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc perfect ive got a couple more on bhg if i can well i guess first thanks for all the details in the slide deck last night i think that was extremely helpful and much appreciated i appreciate the earlier comment around spreads around bhg in the first quarter remaining strong and the demand there still being i think record levels but i guess later on in the quarter and even so far into the second quarter have you seen any decline in the willingness of those thousand or so downstream banks to buy bhg paper more recently m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc tyler we got an email this morning from al crawford the ceo of bhg i think he believing his april will be as strong as its ever been their paper is still in strong demand and so it looks like the one in the second quarter thus far bhg will hold if i can follow back up on stephen scoutens question regarding the reserve between allowance and recourse obligation the allowance also includes joint venture loans where they share the credit risk with the bank and so that does dilute the whole balance sheet reserves so anyway i know i kind of mixed you up there with a couple of responses but did i get to your question tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc yeah i think so i guess im just trying to understand how the dynamic with bhg and the purchasing banks are going to play out this year i mean if default rates do begin to accelerate what happens to the demand from those purchasing banks and conversely i guess bhgs willingness to make those banks whole with losses m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think what theyll do is theyll continually modify their scoring models theyve told us that theyve tweaked those models a little bit theyre aimed at higher fico scores currently and theyre not getting into any kind of new disciplines so they wont have to introduce new disciplines to the banks and their track record has always been to substitute so i dont think they really feel that theyll have that much difficulty getting a bhg loan thats gone through the approval process downstream into the banks i think what bhg is going to have to do that might be a little more of a challenge for them this year is find those higher caliber borrowers to satisfy their business flows and so thus far that seems to be working just fine harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey tyler let me give you a comment and this as you know i think maybe your questions are unnotable maybe so im not trying to say hey i know this is how its going to play out but my belief is that if you go back to the way that model works what theyre doing is generating a highquality asset that a lot of banks in this country serve markets that dont produce that highquality an asset nor at any acceptable volume and so my belief is a lot of those smaller community banks will continue to buy that paper because its the best asset alternative they pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 have and their experience as you know is having gone through years here no bank has ever taken loss on those credits theyre highly regarded credits by these smaller banks and smaller markets so i dont know the answer and i cant guarantee whats going to happen but my bet is that bank network will hold up very well tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc yeah i appreciate that terry and i guess what were just all trying to figure out is as we enter a recessionary environment and losses out of that paper potentially accelerate dramatically does the liquidity dry up and these banks stop buying the paper or does bhg continue to make those banks whole as they historically have to keep that highquality aspect of that paper but take on significantly more losses and less profitability to do so and again i hear you loud and clear that you may not know that answer im talking to play out i think thats just what were trying to figure out so maybe just lastly for me then given that said in terms of harolds comment about how april is trending so far whats the underlying i guess drag on bhgs net earnings growth this year is it less gain on sale margins is it assumption for higher put back risk or losses whats ultimately driving that lower net earnings growth harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think it might be all of that but primarily i think what theyre trying to do is get prepared for maybe additional recourse builds as well as maybe some pull back on business flows i think they reduced their guidance to us on where they think their loans will end up for the year so i think its a little bit of all of that but i still think theyll weather this storm pretty well tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay and then just lastly from me on expenses just a clarification question the earnings release talked about low to mid singledigit expense growth relative to the slide deck talks about low to mid singledigit expense growth relative to annualized its about a million or so difference so im just curious what the baseline that we should be thinking about if it is annualized which is million of baseline expenses to indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc its tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay all right thanks again guys i appreciate all the color harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks tyler operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from catherine mealor with kbw please go ahead pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning can you hear me m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes yeah thank you catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right a question on the ppp program great to see how active you were can you help us think about how to model that million in fees im assuming well see most of it in the second quarter assuming most of it turns into a grant so one on geography do you expect it to come in the margin or in fees and then also how are you thinking about how much of that will come in the second quarter versus trail off over the life of the loan thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a great question i wish id be able to answer to it but what were modeling is the revenue to come in some in the late second quarter and some into the early third quarter and about of the loans being call it forgivable and then recognition of the fees of the remaining to over the next call it yearandahalf after that now weve asked a lot of people about how theyre modeling it and we cant really get a strong consensus one way or the other but thats kind of where weve taken a first stab on collection of that revenue as far as catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and so youre harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc go ahead go ahead harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc as far as fees or margin i think right now were leaning towards a fee recognition but well wait to see what the accountant say about that it may be a margin thing i think im not really sure right now to be totally positive catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but your margin and your fee guidance does not include anything from the ppp program then pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect and then on your reserve build is there any way to think about how much of your reserve build came from the higher risk categories that you work out you gave i guess about of your book is in the retail cre hotel restaurant can we think about how much of the incremental provision we saw this quarter came from just those portfolios or is that too simple of a number to pull harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think we know when we ran the models the way the modeling works is against call report categories and so we dont have it allocated within the models to the various naic codes like that catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it all right okay thank you for all of the disclosures last night super helpful harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys good morning this is anthony elian on for steve following up on indiscernible the willingness of these small community banks to purchase bhg loans changed at all given the high volume of payment deferrals going on in across the country harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont can you go back through that one more time m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc he wants to know has the bhg demand for bhg exists from corresponding banks diminished as a result of deferral activity anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc theyre still able to flex every loan that they send to auction to all these community banks theres still in high demand with respect to the auction platform and so theres a lot of bid traffic on the website for it so they dont believe theyre seeing any diminishment in the appetite for that credit anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then on the of highrisk loans that you called out as most impacted by the pandemic do you have the reserve against these loans for each of the four segments that you called out harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we dont have that degree of specificity the cecl models are built around call report categories and so we dont have it broken down into the individual naics and what we tried to do on the slide deck this morning was aggregate exposure through various products so weve got ci exposure cre exposure all considered within those individual slides so we cant really differentiate or allocate the loss exposure assigned to those anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then finally for me on deferrals so it looks like of your top borrowers in hotels have requested some sort of deferral you mentioned about of the restaurant book indiscernible deferral period ends thanks timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc oh i guess the machine that m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think the question had to do with all the deferrals that were having what are we hearing from our borrowers about their ultimate ability to make payment anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats right that was my question timothy h huestis a chief credit officer pinnacle financial partners inc this is tim huestis id say that its still early i think our conversations with the clients about payment deferrals will pick up in earnest in early may as they start approaching the 60day with any of the clients that want another 90day deferral will be asking for a fair amount of information from them with the purpose of trying to determine how much of the portfolio may not make it versus those that are simply wounded but as of this moment we dont really have feedback from clients on deferrals when they might be able to make payment pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator thank you m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc operator are there any more questions
