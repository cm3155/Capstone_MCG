everyone today synchrony reported strong first quarter results including net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of once again the power of synchronys differentiated business model matched with the continued health of the consumers we serve delivered consistent growth across our diversified set of partners and products on a core basis we opened million new accounts grew average active accounts by and drove billion in purchase volume the highest ever for our first quarter this milestone was achieved with results across each of synchronys five platforms highlighting the strength of our diversified model synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 health wellness purchase volume grew compared to last year reflecting broadbased growth in active accounts and higher spend per active accounts in diversified value purchase volume increased driven by strong outofpartner spend strong retailer performance and penetration growth the growth in digital purchase volume was broad based reflecting growth in active accounts and strong customer engagement in lifestyle purchase volume increased reflecting higher transaction values primarily in outdoor and luxury and in home auto purchase volume increased with the strength in our commercial products and higher transaction values in furniture and home specialty dual and cobranded cards accounted of total purchase volume and increased on a core basis reflecting continued strong response to several new value propositions synchronys record first quarter purchase volume growth is a testament to the utility of our flexible financing solutions the compelling value propositions we offer and the continued resilience of our customers as they navigate the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates we regularly monitor our customers needs and their financial health through our billions of realtime transaction data our insights continue to show only minor variations in average transaction value and frequency across spend categories at a highlevel average transaction values and frequency increased in the quarter across both instore and out ofpartner spend reflecting the continued impact from ongoing inflationary pressure however growth in average transaction values slowed in march possibly reflecting the early impact of lower tax refunds more broadly the data suggests that our customers are actively managing their budgets as the macro backdrop evolves we also continue to see some minor seasonal category shifts within our outofpartner spend so the relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary spend remains essentially unchanged meanwhile across the spectrum of credit segments we serve our highest credit grade borrowers continue to shop more frequently and spend more when they do and the sign of their relative health the transaction frequency of superprime customers in certain platforms grew at rates lasting during the summer of lower credit grade borrowers are shopping somewhat less often this trend has remained relatively stable since the fourth quarter and follows ph apparent behaviors of this credit segment which migrated toward pre pandemic levels in the second half of last year in terms of payment behavior we also continue to see normalizing payment rates across age cohorts and credit bands which is to be expected as consumers spend their accumulated savings and begin to revolve their balances based on the external deposit data we monitor consumer savings levels continued to decline through march though at a slower pace than we saw through most of average consumer deposit balances declined this quarter though they remained above as accumulated savings continued to decline at this modest pace we expect our payment revolve trends to further normalize this in turn will drive continued growth in our interest bearing loan balances the return of delinquency and credit loss metrics to prepandemic levels and better optimize riskadjusted margins for our business synchronys business model is designed to support our customers and partners through changing macro conditions and in particular a more normalized operating environment than weve seen since the start of the pandemic as this progression back to historical levels continues we are managing the business prudently for the long term while watching trends with that view and given the stable labor markets and the relative strength of the consumers balance sheet we remain positive on the state of the consumer today synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 our confidence comes from our decades of experience managing through economic cycles this experience delivers a model that sustainably serves all of our stakeholders at the crux of it all is our diversified partner portfolio and product suite which give us the tools to deliver consistent highquality products and results throughout varying environments we continue to build on these strengths in the first quarter as highlighted by our recently announced product launch and the addition or renewal of more than partners in particular we launched the synchrony outdoors card which was in direct response to customer and partner demand in our powersports business serving as an example of how our platform realignment is enabling synchrony to rethink how we deliver for partners and customers synchrony has long provided valuable installment lending solutions for powersports equipment however in this market which is projected to reach billion by there are significant purchases that occur after the initial purchase such as accessories parts garments fuel service and warranties that were not served by the installment lending model we have traditionally offered in powersports our dedicated platform team with combined experience across partners and products identified this opportunity to meet our customers demand and drive still greater loyalty for dealers turning to our health wellness platform synchrony extended relationships with the largest and secondlargest dental association this quarter solidifying carecredit as the dental financing solution of choice more specifically we announced a 10year partnership extension with the american dental association distinguishing carecredit as the only adaendorsed patient financing solution this endorsement which dates back to includes special features and offers for more than dentist members and their patients we also extended our 20year relationship with the academy of general dentistry remaining the exclusive patient financing solution for the benefits program of the academys more than member dentists these continued longstanding partnerships underscore the unique value that our integrated carecredit offering delivers to both the providers and patients we support and finally we announced renewals across an array of partners this quarter in our home auto platform including with havertys and lovesac synchronys ability to grow and win new partners as well as diversify our products programs and markets enables us to drive greater flexibility utility and value for our customers and partners alike while also enhancing the resiliency of our business in summary im proud of the many ways in which synchrony continues to meet our customer wherever they are looking to make a purchase a payment or a deposit as their needs and priorities continue to evolve synchrony is ready ready to deliver flexibility value and seamless experiences through more solutions in more locations along with our industryleading partners and with that ill turn the call over to brian brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys first quarter performance highlighted the continued strength of the consumer paired with the power of our diversified sales platforms compelling value propositions and prudent financial position consumers continue to deepen their engagement with our products on a core basis ending loan receivables growth of was fueled by a stronger purchase volume along with higher spend per active account synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 net interest income increased to billion as the growth in loan receivables and an increase in loan receivable yields drove higher interest and fees this was partially offset by the impact of the portfolios sold during the second quarter of on a core basis interest and fees increased reflecting the impact of credit normalization as payment behavior trends toward prepandemic levels payment rate for the first quarter when adjusting for lastyear portfolio sales was approximately basis points lower than last year and approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear prepandemic historical average first quarter net interest margin of declined basis points primarily reflecting the higher impact of interest rates on our funding cost partially offset by better yield trends loan receivables yield climbed basis points and contributed basis points to net interest margin incremental liquidity portfolio yield also contributed an additional basis points these gains were more than offset by higher interestbearing liability costs which increased basis points to and reduced net interest margin by basis points and our mix of interest earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately basis points as we built liquidity to fund the anticipated growth rsas of million in the first quarter were of average loan receivables the 187million decline from the prior year reflected the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of and higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher net interest income rsas provide ph an important line with our partners and continue to function as designed by providing a buffer to the financial results of the company and supporting greater stability in our returns this was highlighted in the first quarter as rsa provided a buffer to increased net chargeoffs and higher funding costs provision for credit losses was billion for the quarter which reflected higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve build the build included a consideration for the potential macroeconomic effects of industry credit contraction and a potential impact on consumers though we did not see any related impacts in our delinquency performance today other income decreased million driven primarily by higher loyalty costs as well as the impact from investment gains and losses partially offset by higher debt cancellation income other expenses increased to billion primarily driven by higher employee costs operational losses and technology investments our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was compared to last year in total synchrony generated first quarter net earnings of million or per diluted share delivering a return on average asset of and a return on tangible common equity of next ill cover our key credit trends on slide we continue to see credit metrics performing in line with or better than performance as credit normalization continued at a measured pace delinquency rates remained at approximately of prepandemic levels and recent vintages continued to perform better than those of or the continued tapering of accumulated consumer savings is contributing to a slow moderation of payment behavior towards prepandemic levels as we noted last quarter the trend of normalization has gradually shifted into higher credit grades where balances tend to be larger as a result we saw payment rate declines versus prior quarter of approximately basis points while delinquencies and losses increased in line with our expectation our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year or in the first quarter of our 90plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year or in the first quarter of and our net chargeoff rate increased to from last year still approximately basis points below our underwriting target of to synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was up basis points from in the fourth quarter the sequential increase in the reserve rate primarily reflected the impact of the additional reserve discussed earlier and seasonally lower receivables the allowance also reflects a previously announced 294million reduction of reserves or troubled debt restructurings recorded through equity as we adopted updated accounting guidance this guidance reduced our reserve coverage rate by approximately basis points for the quarter in the quarter synchronys management of funding capital and liquidity remained a source of strength we said and maintained appropriate target levels of common equity liquidity and reserves we generally manage our funding strategy to be interest rate neutral to minimize duration risk and the vast majority of our liquidity portfolio using cash and shortterm us treasuries largely maturing in under one year so as depositors across the country navigate the uncertainty of several bank failures and pronounce the positive flows during midmarch synchrony bank was well positioned as a reliable source of stability for both our customers and our business our stable directtoconsumer deposit base is largely insured with no concentrations in geographic areas or high balance accounts our average depositor has banked with us for approximately five years and nearly of our deposit balances are more than three years old the foundation of this loyalty is synchrony banks awardwinning platform and industryleading customer satisfaction scores depositors are attracted to our seamless digitalfirst experience as well as our competitive rates in fact as customers sought to either balance exposure to their banks or remix their balances to take advantage of available fdic insurance limits during the last three weeks of march synchrony bank saw net deposit inflows of nearly million as we generated doubledigit account growth sequentially this contributed to first quarter deposit growth of versus last year and billion sequentially to reach billion at quarterend over of synchrony bank direct deposits were fully insured and now looking at april trends synchrony bank activity has returned to more seasonal flows powered by continued growth in new account and deposits our deposit base provides a strong foundation for our business representing of our total funding and is complemented by our securitized and unsecured debt which represented and of our funding respectively and increased by billion versus the prior year this increase included the issuance of 10year subordinated debt an important milestone as we continue to more fully develop our capital stack and reach target capital levels total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion or of our total assets up basis points from last year as we grew deposits and prefunded our projected loan receivables growth moving now to discuss synchronys capital position as we previously elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint banking agencies synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately basis points to our regulatory capital metrics in january and we will continue each year until the january of the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet further the tdr reserve reduction mentioned earlier was recognized net of tax in equity adding approximately basis points to our capital ratios we ended the first quarter at cet1 under cecl transition rules basis points lower than last years level of the tier capital ratio was with cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased in basis decreased to compared to last year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 synchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns on the first quarter in total we returned million to shareholders through million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends as of quarterend our remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending june was million synchrony remains wellpositioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan well also continue to seek opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock finally please refer to slide of our presentation for more detail on our full year outlook overall first quarter purchase volume came in ahead of our expectations which when combined with slightly faster payment rate normalization than anticipated delivered stronger receivables growth for the quarter as a result we now expect annual receivables to grow by or more by yearend although we anticipate payment rates ending the year well above prepandemic levels we continue to expect net interest margin of to this outlook reflects the benefit of favorable trends in our deposit betas and payment rates during the first quarter balanced by anticipated impacts of the broader market uncertainty these potential impacts include holding higher liquidity levels in anticipation of growth funding needs as well as competitive dynamics within the industry that could lead to higher betas meanwhile credit normalization continues on track in line with our expectations in terms of both our delinquency and loss trends as a reminder we expect delinquencies to continue to rise and approach prepandemic levels by midyear net chargeoff should follow a similar but lagged progression relative to the normalization in delinquencies ph loss dollars will rise through but will not reach fully normalized levels till approximately six months following the peak in delinquencies as such we continue to expect a net chargeoff rate for the full year of to and that our portfolio will now reach its annual underwriting loss target range of to until given our unchanged outlook for net interest margin and net chargeoffs the rsa remains unchanged between and of average loan receivables and we remain committed to delivering operating efficiency for the full year with a target of approximately billion in operating expenses per quarter in sum synchronys model is built for sustainable performance and strong riskadjusted returns as we grow to meet the needs of our customers our partners and our shareholders as conditions normalize we remain on track to achieve our longterm financial operating targets ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian synchronys track record of execution reflects our differentiated approach to serving our customers and our partners and the consistency that generates for our stakeholders over decades and through economic cycles and waves of innovation we prioritize strategies that deliver sustainable longterm growth at attractive riskadjusted returns so as i look forward i am confident in our ability to continue to adapt and deliver across environments and i am excited for the opportunities we see to deliver on our objectives in the year ahead with that ill turn the call back to kathryn and open up the qa synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and thanks brian and brian i guess the first question id like to ask is given that youre now seeing this normalization of profitability as youre going through this process of losses normalizing and you do have the current economic outlook with the variability around it could you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about growth in new accounts and the discussions that you are having with your partners both about your ability to continue to grow and their how they are thinking about the rsa that they receive brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning moshe so the conversation with the partners they are most certainly looking to us to help drive their new customers and to grow sales the competitive retail environment is very difficult for them right now and i think the ability for us to bring a multiproduct facet to them is very enticing now we just continue to work with them about what the right placement is of products and when we think about the profitability we are returning back to normal levels most certainly the funding cost is higher than what we traditionally have seen historically and they understand that and the conversations around the rsa they do recognize that theyve benefited over the last couple of years with the downside of the market and theyre willing to participate thats the economic arrangement weve had and none of them are really pushing back they most certainly are cautious and want to understand how credits developing whether that were going to take actions at some point which may impact their sales but for the most part they have been supportive and really looking for us to continue to drive volume for them and new customers i dont know brian if you want to add anything to that brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i would just add moshe we talked about this in the past that i think in periods of uncertainty and clearly were in a somewhat uncertain period right now this is when we see our partners engage even more in the card programs and thats great for us the level of engagement i would say across big partners and small partners has never been higher than it is right now they are very engaged they are working with us on really trying to understand what the consumer is doing how theyre going to behave over the next months and were seeing great engagement in the multiproduct strategy as well synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 thats something that we anchored on a couple of years ago lot of momentum across the business on it and i think as partners are kind of taking a step back and trying to figure out the macroeconomic environment and the consumer trends they are also rethinking the financial products that they offer and kind of rationalizing their point ofsale and i think that definitely plays to our strength moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and brian wenzel you said that your margin outlook talked considered an industry environment that could lead to higher betas it seems like from the actions that youve taken and others and the deposit kind of inflows that it seems like the opposite is happening i guess maybe could you just talk a little bit in more detail about what youre actually seeing and what it would take for things to either get better or worse from a deposit beta standpoint from here brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks moshe so as we entered the year we anticipated our betas to rise from last year there was a shift in the end of last year where it got highly competitive with some of the regional banks so when you looked at our betas at the end of last year they were roughly low to mid on highyield savings and around on cds as we came into we anticipated probably a to 15point beta rise in highyield savings and probably a 20basispoint or essentially or more beta on cds right thats how we came into the year id say the market for the most part since the third week of december through the end of the first quarter was very rational and the betas performed better than our expectation right so you look at betas now they are probably mid on savings and about on cds our outlook though moshe is whats baked into the nim guidance is that we still go back to those original points where youre going to be mid on highyield savings and over on cds just because of the fact that there may be other banks who have seen deposit outflows may get more aggressive again we havent seen that yet but thats whats in the outlook so hopefully that doesnt develop which would give us some potential upside moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe have a good day operator thank you our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial hey ryan brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc brian maybe ill just start on the allowance given the accounting change can you maybe just remind us whats included from a macro perspective and then second you talked about normalization still being low and you gave us nice progression on the chargeoffs but i guess given the backdrop plus the amount of growth youre anticipating how do you think about delinquencies and chargeoffs leveling off versus the risk of overshooting just given the impact of growth math and the softening macro backdrop thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah let me try to unpack that question ryan good to talk to you this morning so first when you think about the tdr accounting change this was one where we like many others have chose retroactive treatment so there was a reduction to the reserve that went net of tax through equity on january as we came into the quarter the reserve is fundamentally two things one the seasonal paydown and purchase indiscernible seasonal paydown was lower than our or lower than expectations and then purchase volume was higher than our expectations which gave us a greater asset position at the end of the quarter which led to the growthdriven reserve provision when you think about the components of whats in the reserve from a macroeconomic standpoint effectively what we have and when you look all the way through the baseline model through the qualitative reserves our unemployment is effectively so in this reasonable forecastable period if unemployment stays below we should not have ratedriven reserve provisions again during this quarter though given the banking turmoil and the potential contraction of credit we did add to the macroeconomic overlay to deal with the potential fallthrough effects to the consumer as i think about it stepping forward what id say is we expect really generally growthdriven reserves i mean provision increases and that should be in line with what we thought about that said we still believe that were going to trend downward over time as we move out through the end of the year and into next year down to that adjusted cecl day1 reserve post ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thank you for the color and maybe just on capital brian you noted that youre well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders at youre obviously approaching the target can you maybe just think about how you manage capital in this kind of environment given obviously pretty robust asset growth but clearly a potential recession being on the horizon plus getting close to your targets maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes and how youre thinking about managing the capital base over an intermediate timeframe synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial you know ryan the thing i try to get try to convey is that when you run your loss stress testing models under these severe and idiosyncratic events unemployments up to so in theory you go through and you run those stresses so we look at even if you had some form of recession that came about in the short to medium term in theory our capital provision and our buffers will be able to withstand that so we dont necessarily look at that as something where we would sit back and say we should stop or curtail some of the repurchases or the level of repurchases ph i would say so the economic event is really baked into our capital forecast and our capital plan as we think about the priority you hit it right the first thing we think about is the organic growth of the company second is dividends and third comes down to whether or not we have inorganic opportunities andor share repurchases so some of the cadence that might come about over the next couple of years are there assets that come available that we want to deploy capital into but right now again were going to continue to return shareholders to return capital to shareholders in line with what weve been doing historically and ph short it down towards the again i highlighted in my prepared remarks that we do have to finish development of our preferred stack but thats not necessarily something we need to do today ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan have a good day operator thank you our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is on the rsa at ph in the quarter i think it was about basis points lower than where consensus had and as we think about normalizing credit for the rest of the year should we expect the rest of the year to be at the lower end of the range that you gave us brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning erika so again we gave you the range of to its going to really depend upon how net interest margin plays out when you think about the funding cost of the business losses again is in that same range the to so its really going to play really on how the deposit betas play through and how that the benchmark interest rates flow through to our partners but we expect it to be in the to erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i hate to ask about but a lot of investors are now thinking about credit sensitive financials and trough earnings in a recession and expecting trough earnings to be occurring in so as we think about the dynamics of your net chargeoff dollars reaching prepandemic levels in the potential for fed cuts synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 potentially supporting your margin as you reprise deposits down how should your prospective and current investors think about the rsa in that environment right because i think that as investors think about the step function higher in net chargeoffs is there a way for them just to easily say okay heres the step function lower on rsa in a recessionary year thats unique to your stock brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question so first let me just talk about credit for a second we ended the quarter if you look back at the historical delinquency rates we have been trending about basis points a quarter up on the normalization curve and we ended fourth quarter at roughly we ended the first quarter at roughly between and so credit is normalizing in a way in which we expected and to stay on that trajectory as you slide into we expect the loss rate to be back to our underwriting target of that to there are dynamics that play through youre right if you believe we go back to that type of environment which would have a slightly normal a higher or a more normalized unemployment rate youre then going to see your payment rate come back in line which should give you a tailwind relative to interest and fees but then we also expect the prime rate and the interest bearing liabilities cost to come down those are all kind of working at two effective tailwinds headwind with net chargeoffs as that goes all goes back through the rsas so when you think about that you have plus and minuses there could be a period of time which we hit below for a quarter or two and then you should come back in line with what i would think the longer term financial framework which we gave you which is in that to erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc helpful thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks erika have a good day operator thank you our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks for taking brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc my questions good morning thanks ph the real one is just noticing just that youve had a good migration towards more use of cobrand and dual card brian you talked about kind of product expansion earlier in the call im just wondering given that migration what are you seeing are you seeing any changes in customer activity that are worth noting and is that tied to product expansion or is there other sources of that synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john ill start and then ask brian to add some color i think the dual cardcobrand strategy has been one that weve leaned on heavily over the last decade and what we really like about is the ability to migrate our best customers and our partners best customers into a product that has world spend capabilities and the way that they earn on that card typically gives them a reason to go back into the partners stores so we like the synergies there and we are seeing aboveaverage growth in dual card in world sales which is great for us great for our partners as well just taking a step back as we think about the multiproduct strategy its really is one that you could envision starting with at the kind of lower end of the spectrum of secured card of buy now pay later shorter term installment loan migrating into a revolving product plcc and ultimately into a dual card or a cobrand card we think that strategy is a winning one we think that economically to us when we think about the risk and return profile that allows us to cater to a very wide cross section in terms of our partners customers and so thats where i think weve seen a real change just in the last two or three years as weve been engaging with our partners on the multiproduct strategy a lot of engagement a lot of momentum there and i think that over time thats a winning strategy for us and maybe brian just add a little color if theres any changes in terms of the trends brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so remember john as we always talked about the customers that seek our cards out are the most loyal customers of our partners right so they are engaged with that brand want that value back in the brand and when we look through to the categories of spend that we see ph keeping on the dual card theyre very consistent in how they rank order very sticky so like our number one world spend category is bill pay you think about topfive you have grocery in there you have restaurants in there those are things which are everyday type events that are sticky and continuous and if theyre earning benefits back into a brand which they like theyre going to continue to do that so when you look at transaction values and frequencies its for me relatively consistent which goes back to the point we always we talk about dual card when you think about some of the other brands that are in there that may not necessarily be dual card but have wide utility in some of our digital partners we have a broad swath of this business that goes across multi set of categories john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very helpful color and then brian wenzel apologize if you gave some of this color on the prepared remarks but any i know you captured guidance for nim for instance and rsas but is there any seasonal considerations we should think about those over the course of the next couple of quarters brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so again there will be seasonal trends obviously i think about chargeoff and you generally have a seasonal increase in the second quarter from chargeoffs on an interest margin basis we will have some seasonalities we prefund some of the back end of the year growth into the first quarter into the liquidity profile so you may see them come down and back up and chargeoffs be a little bit higher in the second quarter but i think synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 when you look at chargeoffs and its important to note the pace of acceleration that i highlighted just a couple of minutes ago that were still at of the historical delinquency levels and when you look at the delinquency increases third quarter to fourth quarter and fourth quarter to first quarter they have slowed so again on a dollar basis ph the signs up youll see it in receivables a seasonal low in the second quarter and then youll see the receivables grow and the loss rate kind of flatten out will be down backhalf of the year john hecht q analyst jefferies llc and then anything with respect to nim fluctuations just as part of that question brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i tried to hit on nim i apologize john with regard to it youll see a little bit of downward pressure in the second quarter then it comes back mainly from prefunding for growth in the back half john hecht q analyst jefferies llc you mentioned that thank you yeah thank you i apologize brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial and the only thing maybe that i can say that it could potentially be a tailwind as well or not if the betas that were assuming do not come in the way we anticipate so theyre more favorable so funding cost will go up as much that could be a tailwind john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you john operator thank you our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning maybe to follow up on moshes question previously obviously the cycle is very different from previous ones im just curious if the dislocation and the regional banking space and the implications of it synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 working through the economy might be assisting sort of rethinking how you guys are underwriting i know you mentioned brian doubles this lower spending in march and lower tax refunds could you just talk about those different dynamics and sort of how its affecting the way you guys are thinking about underwriting brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah sure ill start on this one sanjay so i think whats important and we talk about this a lot is that through what was really the best credit environment in the history of financial services in last two years we didnt really take an opportunity to underwrite a lot deeper and thats important for us because consistency is really important to our partners so in times really good times like we had the last couple of years we dont underwrite a lot deeper and thats really done in the hopes that when things get a little bit uncertain or a little bit worse that we dont have to pull back dramatically that consistency is important to our partners and important to us so were not at this point anticipating significant underwriting changes we like our underwriting today the consumer is still healthy were expecting chargeoffs to normalize back into our target range next year so what were seeing right now is still pretty comfortable in terms of the consumer trends so not anticipating anything significant at this point sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then a followup is it sounds like a former partner of yours might be looking for change i am just curious of your appetite to take on large portfolios like that specific one and obviously the stock price is still very attractive here im just thinking through the tradeoffs here and sort of how you guys are looking at the outlook for portfolio acquisitions and such thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah look nothing to share specifically on that situation i just dont want to speculate there were not party to that obviously i would say that we have got a great relationship with sams club going back 25plus years great alignment great engagement and momentum on that program but nothing to really speculate on beyond that i would say just kind of more generally were always in the market for large portfolio acquisitions startup opportunities weve got a very active bd process big team working on it and so thats always of interest to us whats important there though is weve talked about in the past is you got to have really alignment you got to have the right balance with risk and return and i think thats important particularly in an environment like this where youre kind of heading into a period of uncertainty so well continue to stay very disciplined around risk and return sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 operator thank you our next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just wanted to dig in a little bit more on nim i understand the expectation on a forward look is its going to bounce around and i get that were at the high end of the range right now on nim but i did want to understand a what kind of rate outlook is baked into your nim guide and then b if the mix shift is going to materially change as you look through this year from where it was in thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning betsy so the answer to the first part of your question we have a peak fed funds rate of so one more effective move from here we do have some reduction again following the forward curve towards the latter part of the year but that has id say a very small to inconsequential effect on net interest margin for the full year with regard to your second point as you kind of thing about mix of the business i dont think youll see issues necessarily this year with regard to mix impacting the net interest margin well certainly over time i think if you think about where the geography is to the extent health wellness continues to grow at a rapid pace and you see some of the businesses that are more promotional financing grow you may see a shift in the revenue profitability exactly the same but maybe a shift out of nim and the way it comes through with our merchant discount pricing but thats not going to be a issue betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just as a followup you spoke a little bit about loan growth and you did raise the guide from to to 10plus percent but at the same time youve got in a reserving discussion potential tighter lending standards from the industry could you just address how youre thinking about lending standards and is that is the increase in the loan growth that youre looking for i mean i would assume its within the credit box that youve got but maybe you can speak to whats driving that increase in loan growth and how your lending consumers are playing into the outlook thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so our underwriting today again were always making some level of refinements really around ph partner channel performance and whether or not were hitting the right risk adjusted returns so were constantly looking at that and our credit team is focused on it every day were not taking any broad based actions because we do not see either on a vintage level performance the vintages since the start of the pandemic theyre performing better than and so theyre performing well again brian talked about the consistency of our underwriting so we didnt kind of come on and off the gas like many other issuers do so when we look at the stuff that we recently put on its performing at or better than what we saw prepandemic the prepandemic book is performing consistent with how it kind of entered the pandemic so we really dont see a broad based deterioration when we look at entry rates and flows its not something where we are taking what id say broad based actions opening the box or closing the box again we dont use that as really a growth lever like some issuers do but for us its going to be much more consistent synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 with regard to how you think about the loan growth being higher theres two things one we are seeing greater utilization of our cards by consumers and we are seeing a slightly favorable payment rate those two things are driving most of the growth in the first quarter and we expect that to continue somewhat through the back half of or for the remainder of so thats how i think about the loan growth being up again what you may see if the economy does slow faster what you should see or you may see is payment rate to slow faster and then you can see purchase volume taper down a little bit now again i think if you look at dollars here because i think last year ph youre going to start comping the post omicron period which is a tougher comp for all of us so again i think about it as being more adoption and utilization of our cards and then two payment really driving the growth not underwriting betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the chargeoff expectation i know you kept it unchanged at to and you dont expect it to reach the more normalized level till can you just give us a little more granularity on where you are seeing mounting stress and in what product areas and vintages specifically is it still the more recent vintages and you did a continued expansion across income cohorts i believe you mentioned that earlier but just want to get a little more clarity on that thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i wouldnt use the term stresses i dont think we are seeing stresses in there i think what were seeing is the return to more prepandemic levels and i think what youll start to see is in the credit grades of the prime and superprime customers they were well below historical averages mainly because they benefited during the pandemic period whether they got stimulus lower spending lower ability to spend and now theyre using up some of that accumulated savings they are returning back to what i would say prepandemic levels of performance that is on performance on payment rate performance on spending and performance as entry into delinquency and roll through synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 so i wouldnt say its stresses as i just sat there and say we see these consumers migrating back to past behaviors and thats across the portfolio thats not necessarily in one side of vintages or another so thats how i kind of think about the credit development with regard to that with regard to delinquency performance again what youre seeing right now is a very a favorable entry rate into delinquency you are seeing fairly good front end collections the back end collections are pretty weak because you dont have the normal flows through delinquency yet what youd expect to see as entry rates rise a little bit your front end fees to maybe deteriorate a little bit and the backend fees to rise as you put more volume through the collection channels but we have not started to see it we have not seen that yet in our performance but thats what we expect to materialize over the coming remainder of and into john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thank you and then just going back to ryan nashs question on the reserve just to confirm again that the addition this quarter was more growthdriven and payment rate driven and as you look at the outlook if the unemployment rate remains as in your expectation below the level you would expect a migration lower in the reserve ratio from here that correct brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the way again just to be clear the majority of the reserve for the quarter is growth driven there was an addition to the macroeconomic overlay that said listen you have banking turmoil there could be a contraction of credit some of these institutions which will then have an effect in the economy and onto the consumer so we provided for that again the majority of it was growth driven because the assets came in higher than our expectation i think as long as we continue to progress on the macroeconomic assumptions those qualitative reserves unwind and offset some of the growth driven provisions that well have so but again if we track to our macroeconomic assumptions there should not be rate driven provisioning going forward just be growth driven john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it brian all right thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator thank you next question comes from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thanks so much for taking my questions i guess when you think about the pacing of net chargeoffs given what youve talked about and then your assumption on the reserve if you think about timing of wherever your peak loss rate occurs and the potential for reserve releases i know you talked about this but is there a period of time where you decide hey its still cloudy out there we cant release reserves just yet and chargeoffs synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 are rising or do you think you release reserves as chargeoffs are rising the entire time i know its a tough one and i got a followup thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi good morning dom whats interesting about cecl is in theory what it tells you is if you see your peak losses inside of your reasonable supportable period in theory you can begin to release reserves prior to peak losses which i think is very uncommon for the industry but thats a byproduct of cecl so there could be a situation where we release reserves even though we have not got the big losses because youll hit the peak and then begin to come down in that forecasting period we havent seen that yet we dont contemplate that and how we look at and will have to get back to you as you think about and how delinquency plays out for the remainder of the year dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thank you so much and then just we havent talked about the efficiency ratio just yet on the call and obviously you guys are seeing some pretty hefty really nice core efficiency ratio gains yearoveryear im wondering about as you think about over the longer term youd kind of set up some goals how kind of the changes in macroenvironment that you see today included in some of your reserves has that changed where the efficiency ratio trend could go by any chance thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah no great question we dont think the current environment changes are long framework of getting down to that to which is i think best in class when it comes to efficiency ratio i think one of the things that brian and margaret did is during the pandemic they drove us to drive digital efficiencies in our collections and in sourcing of other things that drove productivity again the efficiency ratio was negatively impacted with the decline in interest and fee yield but again as we drive those efficiencies and get operating leverage and brian and i are committed to delivering operating leverage as we step through the periods that should bring us back into that longterm framework and again as the macro environment gets tougher i think the investments weve made digitally with regard to our collections activities across our entire business will help to bolster that where we can control expenses this will be a very different play than what happened back in the great financial crisis where you threw a lot of bodies at it and just started calling people all day thats not what would happen even under any form of recession dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc thanks so much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks have a good day operator thank you we have time for one last question that question will come from david scharf with jmp securities synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning thanks for squeezing me in here first one for brian doubles maybe just a clarification i dont believe i heard or read anything in your releases regarding the status of your capital plan that was submitted last month is there any updates you can provide on kind of status timing and perhaps directional health or magnitude brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks dave why dont i take that question we did submit our capital plan it went through our same process we actually included some additional stresses given some of the developments in the first quarter into that capital plan it was approved by our board and we submitted it to our regulators on target with past years again they go through that and provide what we believe will a nonobjection to that that nonobjection can come anywhere from later this month into may based upon their timing and how long it takes to get through that so we dont anticipate given the capital plan of what we put in that that anything to read into that other than theyre just working through their process and will be back by the later april and may to kind of as soon as we get it well let people know through that with regard to the magnitude of it unfortunately i cant really comment till we get our nonobjection from our regulators david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc yeah understood and just as a followup question wondering if theres any color you can provide on your assessment of competition right now whether you sense theres been any sort of greaterthanexpected pullback and maybe direct mail marketing by some of those you typically would view as primary competitors whether just in general purpose was it kind of pointofsale and i guess along those lines you noted your kind of higher quality credits were transacting more frequently at larger average purchase sizes given all the discussion of macro uncertainty is there anything that ever tells you that now is the time to consolidate market share in various fico pans if you see various pullbacks by competitors or is the environment pretty stable relative to the last few quarters brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so look i would say its still a pretty competitive environment out there i think its a little bifurcated i think the more established players are still competitive in our space of directtoconsumer side for a second so i think were still seeing it as a pretty competitive environment the one thing that is encouraging now as i think is given the uncertainty on the horizon theres pretty good discipline across the more traditional competitors and i think thats generally the case anytime you enter a period like this nobody is factoring in a credit environment like weve experienced over the last couple of years i think thats encouraging so pretty good discipline i do think youve seen some of the fintech players and some of the newer players pull back a bit i do think direct toconsumer direct mail some of that will pull back a little bit but generally in our core space its still pretty competitive out there but with pretty good discipline david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc got it thank you very much synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks operator thank you this
