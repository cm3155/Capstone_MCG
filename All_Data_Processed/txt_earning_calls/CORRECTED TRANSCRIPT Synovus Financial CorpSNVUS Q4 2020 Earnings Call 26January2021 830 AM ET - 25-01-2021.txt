of uncertainty and by thanking customers and communities for trusting us to play an active role in helping them recover and rebuild slide includes some notable achievements from so starting with the paycheck protection program through which we extended approximately loans totaling billion to customers across the southeast p3 represented a truly herculean effort by our team to quickly deliver critical aid to customers and communities in need synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 were also off to a very strong start with the newest round of p3 with approximately loan applications submitted totaling million in the request we operate in one of the best geographic footprints in banking and last year we continued to improve our competitive positioning for and beyond this past january we announced our transformational synovus forward initiative and we made significant progress throughout the year executing on our phase revenue and efficiency efforts as previously stated we expect to achieve million in pretax run rate benefits by the end of this year and kevin will provide more detail later on plans for an additional million in benefits by the end of we made additional investments in talent and solutions to support growth and to enhance technology that further improves the customer experience last year we made upgrades to our mobile and online banking portal online account origination capabilities and other digital touch points and we continued to invest in and grow our existing businesses while also building out new offerings during the year we onboarded new affordable housing and agro business expertise significantly expanded our merchant services business and further matured our structured lending in treasury and payment solutions capabilities also during the year given the dramatic change in the underlying economic environment we moved quickly to further strengthen our balance sheet and capital position our cet1 ratio increased over basis points ending the year at in addition our acl ratio increased to basis points from day one cecl implementation and our total riskbased capital ended the year at the highest level since as a result we entered this year very wellpositioned to facilitate additional growth while also effectively managing balance sheet risk im also proud of our work last year in important areas that are not directly disclosed in financial statements but are important sources of value such as esg reporting financial literacy outreach and financial support of nonprofits and community agencies including the establishment of a substantial scholarship endowment for african american students through the uncf in honor of our former colleague and longtime georgia state representative calvin smyre finally we announced last month that ill be transitioning from chairman and ceo to executive chairman of our board in april following our annual shareholders meeting ill serve in that role until january 1st of to be clear this is not my final earnings call so no farewells or goodbyes just yet ill participate in our first quarter call in april and then will hand the reins over to kevin and team to take it from there with that ill turn to jamie to share fourth quarter financial highlights beginning on slide andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel we ended the year strong with diluted eps of per share compared to last quarter and a year ago adjusted diluted eps was up per share compared to last quarter and a year ago total adjusted revenues of million were up million from last quarter led by broadbased increases in fee revenue continued reductions in deposit costs and accelerated p3 loan forgiveness income adjusted noninterest expense of million was up million from last quarter which was impacted by a million increase in synovus forward p3 and covidrelated expenses moving to slide total loans declined billion in the fourth quarter including accelerated p3 loan forgiveness that resulted in balance declines of million total lending partnership loans held for investment declined million while loans held for sale from this category increased million excluding reductions in p3 and lending partnership balances total loans declined million or from the third quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 total ci loans declined million in the fourth quarter including the million coming from accelerated p3 forgiveness line utilization continued to decline in the quarter down an additional million ci line utilization of was lower than it was the same quarter last year and remained near historic lows total cre loans declined million as payoff and paydown activity increased significantly in the fourth quarter as transactions that were delayed during the height of the pandemic were completed total consumer loans declined million this included lending partnership reductions as well as paydowns within our mortgage and heloc portfolios as shown on slide we had total deposit growth of billion fourth quarter increases were led by core transaction deposit growth of billion and billion in seasonal public funds offsetting this growth were expected declines in time and broker deposits the cost of deposits fell by basis points from the previous quarter to basis points due to a combination of rates paid and deposit remixing in the fourth quarter we were able to reduce the cost of time deposits by basis points and the cost of money market deposits by basis points in this lowerforlonger rate environment we believe there are additional opportunities to reduce deposit costs through cd turnover ongoing repricing as well as the ability to continue to remix the deposit composition slide shows net interest income of million in the fourth quarter an increase of million from the third quarter that was primarily due to the impact of increased p3 forgiveness net interest income was further supported by deposit cost efforts previously mentioned and was offset by modest headwinds from lower loan balances and continued pressure from fixedrate asset repricing exclusive of p3 fee accretion nii in the fourth quarter was million as compared to million the prior quarter we are pleased with continued progress on deposit repricing and positive remixing trends on the liability side of the balance sheet the current environment is enabling us to grow our core relationships and further improve our overall liability profile which is serving to offset a portion of the headwind we are experiencing from repricing within our fixedrate asset portfolios the net interest margin was up basis points from the previous quarter the additional p3 fee accretion of million to a total of million was a meaningful contributor to that increase conversely considerable deposit inflows coupled with the timing of our subordinated debt transaction led to an elevated level of one balance sheet liquidity within the fourth quarter with average excess cash balances increasing billion this dynamic can have a notable impact on the margin with every billion of extra cash on balance sheet diluting the margin by approximately basis points in the coming quarters we expect the elevated cash position to decline as we experience seasonal deposit outflows and as we manage our balance sheet and overall liquidity position this will include further growth within our securities portfolio as well as declines in noncore funding sources such as brokered deposits as of yearend there were million of phase p3 processing fees remaining with approximately million associated with loans that had initiated the forgiveness process excluding the impact from p3 we expect modest downward pressure in nii and nim in the first quarter from the rate environment as asset growth and further reductions in cost of funds partially offset continued fixed rate asset repricing synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 slide shows noninterest revenue which was million flat to the prior quarter after adjusting for security gains adjusted noninterest revenue was million down million from the prior quarter the fourth quarter included notable increases in service charges fiduciary and asset management card fees and brokerage income core banking revenue improved by million to million primarily due to increased activity as we continue the gradual return to precovid levels service charges on deposits sba gains and card fees each increased about million from the previous quarter million in revenue growth from fiduciary and asset management brokerage and insurance helped offset the million decline in capital markets revenue resulting from lower loan activity net mortgage revenue of million down million from the prior quarter remained elevated secondary mortgage production increased which directly impacted commissions despite a quarteroverquarter increase in secondary production fee income declined due to lower margin and pipeline total noninterest expenses were million down million on an adjusted basis nie was million up million from the prior quarter adjustments include million related to the voluntary early retirement program we announced in october million in loss on early extinguishment of debt and million in branch optimization real estate writedowns payback on all of these strategic initiatives are years or less the quarteroverquarter increase in adjusted nie includes million related to synovus forward p3 and covid the synovus forward expenses are upfront thirdparty expenses associated with the design and build of these strategic initiatives this quarters expenses are largely tied to the pricing for value and commercial analytics programs most of the million increase in p3 and covidrelated expenses are upfront consulting and technology fees to streamline the forgiveness process we are encouraged by the forward impact of efforts weve taken and investments weve made throughout the year including the fourth quarter during the quarter we realized an additional million in savings from synovus forward that offset investments in digital and technology these include the first phase rollout of our new commercial digital platform synovus gateway continuing migration of systems to a cloud environment and enhancements to our bsaaml technology these investments will provide future revenue scale risk and expenses benefits in and beyond in the fourth quarter head count declined by most of which occurred in december as part of the voluntary early retirement plan savings from this initiative largely began january so these salary reductions will help offset the seasonal first quarter increases in employment taxes kevin will speak to our full year guidance shortly before providing some comments related to key credit metrics on slide id like to provide a brief update on our covidrelated deferral program which provided for up to days of deferred payments of principal and interest loans in this program with a full pi deferral declined basis points at the end of the fourth quarter performance for borrowers that completed a deferral period has been strong with approximately paying as agreed as weve shared in the past weve conducted enhanced monitoring on industries that were likely to experience the most pressure from the pandemic elevated risks remain and are largely concentrated in hospitalityrelated segments including hotels and full service restaurants more information on those portfolios is available in the appendix synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 as evidenced by key credit metrics were not seeing widespread credit deterioration credit measures of npls npas criticized and classified assets all remained relatively stable for the quarter past dues and net chargeoffs declined modestly based on our forwardlooking credit metrics customer cash flow analysis and customer interactions we expect net chargeoffs in the first quarter to be at or near the range we experienced in the back half of cash inflow updates which are also in the appendix generally showed continued improvement through november although we do expect some pressure to these inflows from recent surges in covid cases this pressure will likely be more impactful in the same hospitality segments i mentioned and were the main driver of increased in criticized and classified loans in the third quarter provision for credit losses of million include net chargeoffs of million or basis points provision for credit losses other than net chargeoffs reflect lower loan balances and a more favorable economic outlook the allowance for credit losses ended the fourth quarter at million and the acl ratio increased basis point to excluding p3 loans the yearend allowance includes a multiscenario framework with a base economic outlook which incorporates the most recent stimulus with modest economic growth and declines in unemployment rate throughout and we return to a twoyear reasonable and supportable period this quarter as economic uncertainty is moderated another noteworthy change included use of a thirdparty providers economic projections as a starting point for our economic outlook rather than a benchmark or challenger as it was used earlier in the year changing to a thirdparty provider did not have a material impact on the economic inputs or resulting allowance theres more detail included in the appendix preliminary capital ratios on slide show continued improvement as cet1 increased basis points to this quarter we ended the year above the higher end of our operating range of to which positions us well as we move into the new year the total riskbased capital ratio of was up basis points it includes subordinated debt optimization efforts completed in the fourth quarter that aligns with our ongoing efforts to diligently manage our capital position and weighted average cost of capital our capital plan maintains the current common shareholder dividend of per quarter and includes authorization for share purchases of up to million we will be opportunistic with repurchase activity throughout the year as we prioritize organic growth first and balance capital deployment with factors such as uncertainty in the economic outlook based on the current outlook we will continue to target a cet1 ratio at the higher end of the to range with more opportunity to deploy capital as we gain greater clarity around the effectiveness of the vaccine as well as confidence in the broader economic recovery ill now turn it over to kevin who will provide an update on synovus forward and provide our outlook kevin blair president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thanks jamie let me take a few minutes to provide a brief update on our synovus forward progress having initiated the program back in the second half of was a year of execution and expansion as we have shared the initial focus was on funding our journey through various efficiency initiatives i am pleased with our progress and the delivery surrounding these first round programs the thirdparty spend program will fully deliver synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 million run rate savings in we also consolidated branch locations this past year which will result in approximately million in run rate savings on a goforward basis and as we close out we completed two components of organizational efficiency work stream with a voluntary early retirement program and a back office staffing optimization which will produce million in run rate benefit in as progressed we expanded our efforts within synovus forward by embarking on several revenuebased initiatives starting with our pricing for value program we have begun the marketbased repricing of our treasury and payment solutions offerings and are pleased with the progress todate with an anticipated run rate benefit of approximately million in the first half of as jamie has also noted we have been able to more aggressively reprice our deposit throughout with the month of december coming in below our previous cycle lows we also kicked off our commercial analytics program utilizing transaction level data we have built a tool known as ph smart that will allow our commercial bankers to better identify opportunities to expand relationships reduce attrition as well as better manage changes in underlying risk profiles as we begin to pilot the ph smart tool we are convinced we will see incremental revenue benefits from its full deployment we have also prioritized resources capital expenditures and business activities to ensure that we have continued to invest prudently during the year as kessel referenced during the highlights we made significant improvements in our consumer and business digital capabilities during the year enhancements made improved the customer experience expanded new account origination availability and built a more scalable platform for future functionality deployment as a result of our progress and the plans for additional phase initiatives we remain committed to deliver the million run rate pretax benefits by the end of we have also increased our objective by an additional million run rate benefit to be achieved by the yearend the additional benefits will come from both revenue and expense initiatives with a heavier weight towards revenues much of the additional benefit will come from expanding the breadth and depth of the programs already launched as well as leveraging new processes technology products and solutions and talent to generate the incremental benefits we will provide more detail throughout the year as we set more specific execution plans for the next phase of synovus forward turning to slide this slide provides an overview of our outlook which incorporates synovus forward initiatives and other strategic objectives and is predicated on our current view of the economic stability and growth in our footprint for the year before i share more details around the individual categories let me first touch on a few things that gives me confidence as we enter first the talent we have added in recent years continues to provide outsized opportunities for growth as they continue to build their portfolios to more seasoned levels secondly investments we are making in products and capabilities continue to pay dividends for example treasury and payment solutions new revenue in was up over and over two years ago and lastly our teams are better prepared for the operating environment in and will be able to avoid many of the distractions and challenges that we encountered in with our enhanced online account origination capabilities and remote sales approaches our sales effectiveness for the year will improve synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 so lets start with the asset side of the balance sheet we expect an additional to of the p3 loans funded in to be forgiven by mid2021 leaving around million on the books for an extended period as kessel mentioned earlier we are participating in the second round of the p3 program and since opening our portal on january 19th we have received strong application volumes and are working diligently to efficiently process the request to support our eligible customers and prospects needs based upon our results to date as well as our preliminary analysis of eligibility we believe the number of applicants will range from to which compares to just over last year we expect the average loan size to be less than the round one average of approximately which would result in a higher percentage of fee revenue excluding all p3 balance changes we expect loan growth of approximately to in given the current environment we do forecast this growth to accelerate in the back half of the year and will be welldiversified across business units asset classes and geography despite continued uncertainty in the markets we have reasons to be optimistic about our expectations for loan growth our expectations are that we will see a steady increase in production throughout in our commercial book as economic activity improves from our discussions with our customers we also know there is a pentup demand for capital that has been delayed due to the overarching uncertainties synovus is wellpositioned for growth given our marketplace and business model entering our teams were achieving record levels of production and we expect to return to similar levels post pandemic we love our footprint and the outsized growth expectations for the southeast the demographics of our markets continue to be very constructive for growth in addition our model is very attractive to both prospective customers and banking talent and weve seen this over the recent years as such we expect to continue to see organic growth arising from the execution of our gotomarket strategy as well as any fallout that may occur as industry consolidation continues weve also added and expanded through our new specialty verticals in including structured lending affordable housing and agri business these teams will provide accelerated growth in and beyond as we continue to evaluate the expansion into new industry and asset class specialty areas that will expand our offerings and provide new sources of growth in the future a return to a more normalized ci line utilization would increase funded loan balances by million as compared to yearend balances although there is obviously some uncertainty related to how quickly this will take place especially with the possibility of additional stimulus and elevated liquidity we do expect the normalization to occur over time lastly we have the capacity to increase our lending partnership portfolios which can serve as an effective and profitable use of excess liquidity and capital as jamie mentioned earlier given the current liquidity environment and the recent increase in interest rates we are likely to increase the size of the securities portfolio in the nearterm now lets move to revenue net interest income will remain under pressure from fixed rate asset repricing we will actively work to reduce the impact of rates through balance sheet management loan growth future reductions in cost of deposits as well as the potential deployment of excess liquidity in the investment portfolio or higher returning asset classes such as thirdparty lending there is a similar story with fee revenue which faces the headwind of normalized secondary mortgage revenue the expected decline in mortgage activity will be largely offset by increases in most other categories including core banking fees as well as fiduciary and asset management fees our investment in treasury and payment synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 solutions the recently launched merchant program and various wealth management businesses will provide added momentum throughout one business that we are especially excited about is the synovus family office despite a challenging year the family office grew assets under management by and new business revenue booked for the year increased this unique value and service provided by businesses like synovus family office will provide continuous growth opportunities in aggregate we expect total adjusted revenues to decline to in some opportunities to perform at the higher end of the range include more favorable deposit pricing further steepening in the yield curve higher than expected economic activity increased participation in phase of the p3 program and acceleration of the benefits from enhanced analytics and other revenuecentric synovus forward initiatives moving to expenses in the fourth quarter we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with branch and head count reductions as we assess the current environment and the resulting pressures on revenue we are proactively adjusting our expense base to promote a return to positive operating leverage despite our overall actions to reduce expenses it is not inhibiting our ability to continue to invest in areas of focus with approximately million in strategic investments in technology and digital plan for in aggregate we expect adjusted expenses to decline between and for the year we continue to assess challenge and target all expense categories as we look to further improve our efficiency and effectiveness and remain committed to positive operating leverage over the longterm a large portion of the annual decrease will be realized in the second half of as seasonal increases in employment tax and the previously mentioned investments in digital and technology will be more frontloaded turning to capital our cet1 ratio of is above our stated operating range of to existing capital levels as well as the inflow from core earnings will support our anticipated balance sheet growth and strategic objectives jamie mentioned some components of the capital plan so ill simply reiterate that were a growth company and thats our first priority for deploying capital other priorities include maintaining a competitive dividend capital optimization and other deployment opportunities including share repurchases the cet1 target of in the outlook is at the higher end of our to operating range which we believe is prudent while greater levels of uncertainty exists given our current cet1 ratio and our economic outlook it is likely we will remain above our targeted range in the nearterm as clarity around the economic outlook increases we will look to further deploy capital through balance sheet growth andor share repurchases lastly assuming no significant changes to the current tax environment we expect an effective tax rate of to weve increased our focus and execution around various tax strategies some of which were executed in and others that will be established over time that will provide opportunities to further reduce the effective tax rate from current levels for sensitivity purposes a federal tax rate change from to would result in an increase of our longterm effective tax rate of that would follow a onetime adjustment to the dta that would mitigate a portion of the impact in the first year now before we move to qa let me close with a couple of comments i am humbled and honored to be presented with the opportunity to transition into the ceo role in april kessel has led this company with such a steady hand over the last years and has returned the company to a position of strength with this handoff working with kessel in his role as executive chairman of the board we will continue our unwavering path forward and on the second point as we evaluate our path forward i am convinced our purposedriven advicebased relationship approach complemented with innovative digital capabilities and functionality will provide a compelling differentiated value proposition in the crowded and competitive landscape we operate within we will continue to synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 use synovus forward to set our vision and agenda for the transformational imperatives that are required to ensure we execute and deliver on our short and longterm business and financial objectives despite the uncertainties will serve as our next step forward in achieving these goals and with that operator let me turn it over to you for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question today comes from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its great to see the additional million from the synovus forward i was just wondering roughly speaking how much of that benefit do you think will actually drop to the bottom line i think i heard jamie say that some of the savings in the fourth quarter were reinvested maybe on the technology front should we be thinking about that additional million as all dropping to the bottom line or will some of that be reinvested into the franchise andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brady this is jamie ill kick this off and then hand it over to kevin the first thing i would just say is were a growth bank and our synovus forward efforts are intended to offset strategic spend in digital and technology and other growth initiatives to help us deploy and kind of bring synovus to more customers and so with regards to the overall expenses that million all of that is a top line benefit however we do have spends in other areas that are increasing and so what i hope you see in our guidance is the commitment to react to revenue pressures and we strive for positive operating leverage in a challenging environment and so we think that as you look at youll see an approximate or so benefit due to the synovus forward initiatives in calendar year and that helps us have the ability to go out and spend on digital on technology on people to get us to where we need to be to grow and so let me hand it to kevin to give a little more detail on the synovus forward initiatives synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so brady jamie nailed it its top line initiatives that will generate the million but as we think about this we look at every investment from an roi perspective so as we look at new opportunities whether itd be talent or technology were going to make those investments if they have the right return on investment the important thing as weve talked about in the past is our other calibration factor will be topquartile performance so as we look at the million can we look at our capacity to reinvest were still focused on that topquartile performance which was based on rotce roa and efficiency ratio and its fairly turbulent right now so its hard to see what that number is but we know with the million that weve committed we know were moving in that direction andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and brady the only other thing i would add is as we look at the benefit of these initiatives and specifically on the expense side we obviously get the benefit of fourth quarter activity immediately but the benefit will flow in over the course of and we would expect the largest impact on the yearoveryear declines to be in the second half of the year brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful and then it was great to see the outlook on slide the one thing thats missing there is a provision guidance which i know can be tough nowadays jamie i heard you point to basically basis points in net chargeoffs there in the first quarter so it seems like net chargeoffs are going to be low so looking at your reserve youre at basis points i think your dayone cecl reserve was around like to basis points so it feels like were headed back there but maybe just talk about how fast we could see reserve releases in this year and next andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah the milliondollar question is how will this all play out i mean we obviously see a lot of uncertainty out there and i think youre right to look at day one cecl as a potential where we could land in a more normalized environment assuming no significant changes to loan mix in the loan portfolio so i think that that is reasonable i would just point to the uncertainty in the outlook i mean when we look at credit and we thought about giving guidance typically we would give fullyear guidance but we only did the first quarter because of the uncertainty in the outlook and so when we look at this year when we look at we believe that theyre very possible scenarios where chargeoffs remain stable all year long at current levels a scenario like that could include a vaccine effective vaccine rollout phase p3 success future stimulus a strong economic recovery but then there are also scenarios where we see chargeoffs increase throughout the year to more than double todays rate and that could include covid case increases ineffective vaccine no stimulus basically a slow or declining economy and so given how wide the range is between these hypothetical scenarios we just didnt think it was prudent to give fullyear guidance but were committed to giving guidance as we go through this year as we gain clarity on the outlook but obviously we feel good about where we are we feel were adequately reserved for this uncertainty and well see how it goes as we move through the year synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the color guys operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america securities ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess just first around the guidance for the revenue outlook i was wondering if you can break it down a little bit more for us in terms of fees versus nii and what your expectations are i mean mortgage banking was very very strong last year how youre thinking about it and on the nii side jamie like when do you see core nii at least indiscernible for synovus on a quarterly basis andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim let me start with fee revenue and youre right as we look at industry data on mortgage revenue in obviously there will be a significant decline from everybody is speaking to this and i dont think were any different and so what you will see from us in fee revenue is fee revenue will be down yearoveryear likely in versus driven by an approximate to decline in mortgage revenue and that more than offsets this really strong broadbased growth in our other fee businesses and so its unfortunate that its overshadowed just due to the strength in of mortgage but we are really excited about the broadbased growth we have in the core banking fees fiduciary and asset management including the family office that kevin mentioned earlier and brokerage and so thats what we expect in fee revenue as we go through and then with regard to nii im glad you mentioned kind of core or stripping out the noise of p3 because thats very important and what i would say there is as we look at nii you should see a decline in the first quarter really due to two things first is day count which youre obviously aware of but second is fixed rate asset repricing including an acceleration of prepayments in the securities book and then once we get past the first quarter we expect nii to be stable to slightly increasing throughout the year as benefits from deposit repricing and loan growth just outpace the headwinds of that fixed rate asset repricing with regards to the deposits on the deposit side were obviously pleased with where we landed in the fourth quarter if you look at monthly data we achieved our objective of prior cycle lows and then when we look forward we believe that we can get an incremental basis points reduction in total deposit cost in the first half of of that basis points for the fourth quarter just due to the maturities in our time deposit book obviously we see benefits as well between price and mix and nonmaturity deposits but we see more room to go there and were excited about those opportunities synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thats helpful jamie and just one question i guess kevin you spent a lot of time on technology investments both in terms of back office front office just talk to us in terms of one does this like how would you pick synovus relative to large regional peers the big banks within your markets like do you feel confident in terms of the wherewithal of the franchise and has all of this made you sort of look for like tuckin acquisition opportunities in the fee income on the technology side that we should anticipate over the next year or so kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim its a great question i think before you start evaluating the functionality and capability you all must have to look first at what your customers are telling you and if you look at synovus customers they have a higher nps scores or loyalty scores than most of the big bank peers so what were providing them today are making them satisfied with the offerings and making them very loyal to the company and as we think about going forward the way that were able to garner additional growth and relationships is from those referrals so i think its first important to look at what our customers are telling us as it relates to investments we obviously saw the need to continue to improve the capabilities and functionality on the digital front we have my synovus on the consumer side where we continue to provide enhanced customer experiences weve seen that with the scores that weve gotten online weve also this past year rolled out enhanced online origination capabilities so now our customers have the ability to originate more products from the comfort of their home which is obviously with the pandemic something that we saw a shift in activity and we feel like were on par with being able to do that our focus in first quarter which jamie touched on is the expansion and the development of a new commercial portal which is called synovus gateway and thats going to be we believe bestinclass as we relate to others in terms of their cash management systems and their digital capabilities for business customers and thats been a big focus for us we think we can win in that space we have the right to win and we think our technology will continue to be improved over time as weve told you in the past the key here is making sure that you partner with the right fintech and that you get the right sort of rd thats happening at that company which allows you to continue to enhance your offerings and we feel like were in a good position to do that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch anything around ma on the fee side kevin kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah i mean look we look at all sorts of ma as it relates to any sort of benefit that we would have for any capability adds or new products and functionality weve been focused on growth in fee income through the treasury and wealth management businesses and weve had good growth there doubledigit growth and so well continue to leverage the investments weve already made but if theres something that were to make sense from an ma standpoint we would look at it but right now we really believe the best investment we have is in synovus and continuing to leverage the talent and the technology and resources we have today and we think there is growth that will come from that in our marketplace as well we feel like were in one of the best footprints in banking so we dont see currently a need to go out and have to use ma to stimulate growth synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats great thank you operator the next question is from jennifer demba of truist securities andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey jennifer kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc hi good morning i think the key questions has been asked but just a question on the second round of ppp what kind of borrowers are you seeing requesting applications at this point kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so jennifer this is kevin were seeing as kessel mentioned about applications for right around million so the average loan size is a little less than so similar borrowers to what we saw before obviously to qualify you had to have a reduction in revenue in and i think what we see with most of our borrowers is that occurred early in the pandemic the second quarter but weve actually been pleased with our process and how weve been able to get the applications onboarded weve leveraged a thirdparty this time which i think will make us more efficient and effective were not having to use a lot of internal resources to get that completed but theres really been no surprises from a company standpoint or naics code or size its really been just a subset of what we had expected from the initial withdrawals on p3 and so as i said right at today we had in the initial phase so a smaller percentage than maybe what you would expect at this point jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay and second question does the million additional synovus forward initiatives you mentioned does that contemplate any corporate or other branch rationalization or corporate real estate andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc i mean corporate real estate or branch rationalization sorry synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah it absolutely does one of the things that weve recognized as you know jennifer weve been able to rightsize our branch network over the last years i think if you look at legacy synovus branches weve cut almost of the locations but what you have to look at today is when you look at our branches and you evaluate what percentage of our branches are within three miles of one another and which percent of our branches are less than million in deposits we have relative to our competition we have a lower percentage so as we go forward we will continue to look for ways to optimize the branch network but well also look at staffing levels well look at size of branch locations well look at two for ones it will not be traditionally theres just the consolidation of the branch network because we feel like weve done a good job of that as it relates to corporate real estate that was part of our initial assessment as an opportunity and as we evaluate the remote workforce environment and what the needs are going to be longterm there will obviously be opportunities there but were not waiting for that were taking the opportunity now to renegotiate rent and get benefits from that and so just rationalize the space that were using so yes both of those will be part of the shortterm and longerterm initiatives jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks operator the next question is from brad milsaps of piper sandler brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co jamie i appreciate your comment about the desire maybe to grow the bond portfolio a little bit more with some of your excess cash just curious if you could comment on maybe other moves on the other side of the balance sheet maybe specifically as it relates to the broker money market and the brokered time it looks like the brokered time accounts yield or costs were pretty much unchanged linked quarter just curious kind of when you start to maybe see some movement there and then anything else you can do on kind of the longterm debt side of things that was down on average quite a bit although it look like the rate and dollar costs was up so just any additional color there or maybe other moves on the right side of the balance sheet aside from just normal repricing andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 yeah great question and obviously by our actions in its something you can see were extremely focused on and when we look at on the brokered side even in nonmaturity a lot of those are governed by terms and so we dont have the flexibility necessarily to take those all when you would want to immediately but on the cd side we have approximately million maturing in the first quarter a little more than million in the second quarter and well continue just to let those run off in the fourth quarter you saw the expenses that were associated with our debt kind of optimization and that included both the subdebt as well as optimization of our home loan bank exposures and so youll continue to see us look at the right side of the balance sheet and digging in on ways we can optimize our liabilities as we go forward in brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and then maybe a question for kessel or kevin i appreciate the guidance around loan growth for the year particularly in the back half is there a way to quantify kind of based on the number of people that youve hired or new verticals that you brought in sort of what your capacity is kind of based on what these folks had at their previous institutions just kind of curious kind of what the what you indiscernible view as the bigger picture opportunity based on all the hiring that you did kind of prepandemic with those folks maybe getting off to a slower start because of the pandemic whats kind of the size of the pie thats out there for synovus kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yes lets maybe try and tag team i will let kevin give a little more color but i will say this we had been super excited about the level of talent that continues to be attracted i think to our operating model and to kind of our history of how we serve customers kevin mentioned the relationshipcentric approach of both in the private wealth in the middle market wholesale bank in the cre space we had great talent adds over the last months to months and then as we again stood up some of our specialty verticals which kevin talked more about we have i think additional capacity and certainly think that loan growth for this year will be backhalf loaded just for a lot of factors but certainly pandemic vaccine recovering economy kevin maybe you could speak to any of those in particular where you think we have outsized capacity again i think i think our specialty lending areas have really proven a source of value not just to us but to the marketplace in terms of how weve brought expertise there so kevin maybe you could go a little further detail kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yes no kessel its a great point ill use some math to talk about i think where the opportunity is and when you think about just loan production and i think this is a salient point when you look at commercial loan production in we had funded production of right at billion and that was down roughly in versus largely due to the pandemic so if you just return to production levels that we observed in it would produce about million of incremental production now that that sounds large in and of itself but i think whats more important is to look at where we were producing in the first quarter of and our commercial production in the first quarter came in higher than where it was in first quarter of so when you start putting quantification to what these teams can do youll look at just returning production back to levels would be million and then if you were to be able to sustain a to growth rate over time obviously that growth becomes exponential synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 so to kessels point structured lending has been a great addition to our team but even as weve added talent within established areas like abl or cre or commercial real estate you know theres lots of opportunities to grow within mature products this just brings on new talent so across the board we think that there is opportunity to increase the production and get it at levels much higher than what we would have had back in brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thats helpful and i assume that all that all plays into your the additional million that youre looking for in kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp its part of it you know obviously weve said that you know new talent and growth on the balance sheet growth in fee income would be a component of that but its not what were making the million bet on but its part of that forecast brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thats helpful thank you guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator the next question is from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so with all of the initiatives underway you seem to be building a better mousetrap on the digital side to acquire new customers youre also in great markets when should we start to see revenue growth trends start to separate from peers on a sustained basis when i look at the guidance for loans or revenue i cant say theyre standout expectations synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes steve this is jamie i guess what i would point to is the growth in the core business our headwind right now on revenue when you look at growth is a couple of things one is interest rate sensitivity and the impact of rates on the book and thats a headwind on nii and that slight downward pressure and kind of core when you back out the impact of p3 thats a little bit of a headwind and youll start to see loan growth and the deposit costs more than offsetting that as we get into and then we feel really good about our fee revenue growth were doing yearoveryear comparisons we have the kind of headwind this year in of a really strong mortgage performance in and so we feel good about the components we feel good about longer term loan growth we believe that we can grow faster than the economies in our market in our fivestate footprint which we believe will grow faster than the general us economy and so we feel good about our revenue growth based on those factors but we do have that headwind of nii just due to rate sensitivity steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay is it safe to say in terms of timing which was my question that maybe its a event not a event given the headwinds you outlined and my question is kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp well we steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc when well see revenue outpace peers everybody has similar pressure right now kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thats right thats right that seems appropriate steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just for my second question i want to follow up on brads question what is the number of revenue producers at the company today and how has that changed over the past one or two years thanks kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp you know thats a tough question to answer because you have all the branch team members but we in back office you know theres i would tell you that theres of our team member base thats in some sort of frontline capacity and if you look at over the last several years where we have been adding resources has been on the frontline and weve been taking cost out of the back office through automation optimization synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 and so the ads that were making are on the frontline and when we do that were looking at the return on investment when we make the decision to add so we may choose to leverage adds in middle market commercial banking before we would in a well space just because it may have a quicker payback steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color operator next question is from jared shaw of wells fargo securities jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jared andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess when you look at the expense guidance as the base that we should be using the full year billion billion adjusted or is that really our annualized million andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp full year adjusted jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then when we look at that million as you called out of synovus forward ppp and covid related expenses thats still on the adjusted i guess whats the timing for that to roll off is that just really dependent upon full back to work back to normal economy or is that more of a specific to fourth quarter kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yes the synovus forward upfront thirdparty expenses are initiative specific and so those are individual and you can think about those per initiative that we choose to pursue and so those think about those that way on the covidrelated and p3 fees the fees we have in the fourth quarter are related to the forgiveness process of phase synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 in you will see some fees associated with both the origination and forgiveness of the second phase of the paycheck protection program the upfront origination fee will be embedded in loan yields so they will not show up in expenses but the forgiveness fees will show up as you see them in the last quarter jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just shifting back to the allowance i appreciate the comments you made around that i guess when we look at the ratio its still pretty high compared to peers and it seems like you have some qualitative overlays in there i guess what could be the main drivers of lowering that ratio faster or is it just second half gdp accelerating above sort of a consensus estimate or is it just more once you all get comfortable with that potentially lower loss content we could see those qualitative overlays reduce kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thats the right way to think about it is that as we get into this year and as we look at the economic outlook and get more comfort and confidence that the base case scenario is whats going to play out thatll reduce the uncertainty thats embedded in our allowance and our allowances it does not have any future stimulus in it it does not have a lot of the things that are being discussed today as benefits to the general economy so well constantly reassess our calculations and our estimates but i think youre thinking about it the right way jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay appreciate it thank you operator the next question is from john pancari of evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc i know you indicated that the when you were discussing the synovus forward program that a lot of that is revenue but the backbone really here is the projection is for positive operating leverage longer term so can you give us an idea in your modeling in your expectations what is the timing that you see returning to positive operating leverage synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well john as weve mentioned thats an important priority for us and we believe that we have a shot at positive operating leverage in yearoveryear on adjusted revenue and adjusted expenses its not a layup theres a lot of effort that will go into that both on the expense and revenue side but thats our objective and so you see that in our guidance when we say that we expect revenues to be down to expenses to be down to thats what were shooting for now look its early in the year and theres a lot of work to do to achieve it but thats our objective john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yes thanks and just given the ranges are somewhat wide so wanted to clarify andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes john pancari q analyst evercore group llc then on and then on the capital return front i know you indicated that the priority is organic and that youre going to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases so if you could just maybe help elaborate a little bit around the potential timing about when you step back into the market and buyback stock given you have the authorization thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes john you know as we think about our capital management framework and philosophy you know im going to go back and just look back at we feel really good about performance in a challenging environment starting the year at cet1 and first quarter dropping down to due to customer loan growth and now being about basis points higher at yearend we feel really good about that and we feel good about how we got there through stable ppnr stable you know strong credit performance and active balance sheet management so we feel really good about our process and our framework and how we as management respond to those environments but in todays environment we do believe its prudent to operate with higher capital than we felt a year ago operating at the highend of the range at to we also believe that our common equity dividend at a quarter is appropriate for but you know so were pleased with where we are we believe that our balance sheet both capital and liquidity are positioned for us to achieve success in and be ready for customer loan growth and so we feel good about that as well and thats our priority is to deploy that capital to loan growth but as you are well aware today were at ph bps our target is bps and were above it and so were going to think about how do we deploy capital above our target again the priority is customer loan growth but if thats not there for us then well look at share repurchases but were going to be patient and opportunistic we do not expect to buy shares in the first quarter but we will be looking at that as we proceed through synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it thanks jamie and then just lastly if i could ask i know on slide you walked through your adjusted rotce and about for was clearly in the midteen to how should we think about your updated thoughts on your appropriate longterm rotce as trends ultimately normalize kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp john as kevin mentioned earlier we believe that theres a lot of uncertainty out there but we also believe that the million we have in for synovus forward will help us get to top quartile and so we dont believe that theres enough clarity in the economic and environmental outlook today to be able to give a good return on tangible or roa estimate over the long run if you look at the rate curve it remains flat for a very extended period of time and so as we get more clarity on the outlook well give more clarity on our longer term return targets or where expect to be but at the moment we just think its more prudent to just be clear that were targeting top quartile kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and john just to add that the pace in which we get there thats our focus maybe not so focused on the destination and what the number is but making sure that were putting the initiatives in place and getting the incremental performance that allows us to grow faster at a relative pace john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thank you kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks john operator the next question is from ken zerbe of morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc given your deposit composition and how you see that changing what is a reasonable floor for your deposit costs if we think out over the next months synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp ken thats a great question you know i mean for the fourth quarter were sitting here at basis points i mentioned that we can get another basis points in the first half of just due to time deposits alone obviously well get benefits from nonmaturity deposits and mix as well which could get you another or basis points from there but so i would say that in the next months basis points is certainly reasonable and were trying everything we can to get it lower ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great and then just one followup just as a clarification question your comments that you would expect a modest downward pressure on nii and nim in the first quarter does that exclude all ppp fees andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes yes and so it does and ken just a little more color on that in our slide deck we mentioned that we have million in fees inprocess at yearend but just to be clear theres also the normal fee amortization that will happen in the first quarter there other loans that could go through the forgiveness process in the middle of the quarter we would expect in the first quarter to potentially have approximately million in p3 fee realization ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect that helps thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes operator the next question is from brody preston with stephens inc brody preston q analyst stephens inc good morning everyone kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brody andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 i just want to go back to the loan growth i just wanted to get a sense i appreciate you sort of gave some i guess numbers around how stacked up this year and what it would look like if you got back to last year kind of levels but just wanted to get a sense for how loan pipelines stack up currently relative to the yearago period and maybe during the middle of the pandemic and then the expectation for paydowns are those to remain elevated in the near term kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah so this is kevin so let me first start with the paydowns and payoffs although the fourth quarter was elevated from second and third quarter when you look at for the year payoffs and paydowns were in line with previous years and expectations so what fourth quarter was was just maybe some lower payoffs and paydowns that would have occurred in the secondthird quarter that were just pushed back into the fourth quarter so as we look into we dont expect payoffs and paydowns to be in an elevated level as it relates to production i mean very clearly our growth for will come from our commercial business we believe that we can get midsingle digit growth in both core ci and core cre growth and that comes from as i mentioned earlier just having increased levels of production the pipelines to your question are not fully back to where they were prepandemic and in the fourth quarter our commercial production was actually down about yearoveryear so it has trailed off based on the underlying economic environment but all of our line leaders are seeing folks come back into the pipeline with new projects and new opportunities and so we expect for those to continue to build throughout the year as jamie mentioned probably more so to the second half of the year and then i also just want to remind you that jamie touched on the thirdparty retail partnerships we currently have right around million in thirdparty partnerships as you know historically weve operated right around billion so we have capacity with our liquidity and capital profile to be able to go out and make some purchases from thirdparty if they meet our hurdles from a profitability and a return perspective so as you think about loan growth for next year im fairly bullish that we can produce at the higher end of the range just based on the fact that production will return throughout the year if utilization were to normalize as i said in my prepared remarks just getting back to normal levels there would be million and we have some dry powder as it relates to thirdparties so we feel confident that we can deliver on our loan guidance brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay thank you for that and then just one more on synovus forward i appreciate the timeline you put in the deck i just wanted to get some clarification that the million annualized in the first half is that more i guess heavily weighted towards the rest of the expense capture expense save that you need to do and then as the million in the second half is that more based on the revenue enhancements and then i guess you gave sort of some indication that its going to be more heavily weighted towards revenue on the additional million but i guess i wanted to better understand how much of that is going to be driven by new hires i guess on the fee side or is it more on the loan origination side thats going to help with those revenue enhancements in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ill jump in on the timing and then hand to kevin about the hires when we look at the timing what i would say is that first million is kind of a twothirdonethird split with expenses being twothirds of the first million and then that reverses for the million and so for the million its approximately twothirds revenue and onethird expense and obviously all of that is in progress and in process we have workstreams identified but not ph ticked off for that and so it could evolve but thats how we look at it today kevin ill hand to you for the hire side kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah so look i dont want you leaving thinking that theres a great deal of expense for new hires that would be required to generate the revenue growth two big components of revenue growth and one that we havent started yet is on the analytical front as i mentioned weve started the commercial analytics and we believe thats going to give our frontline bankers a tremendous opportunity to crosssell within the existing book we will in the second quarter roll out the same project for retail analytics and so thats going to provide our private wealth and our retail bankers the opportunity to do the same and so much of the revenue that we see in the future is just continuing to leverage that analytical platform to be able to sell deeper into the relationships we already have as well as reduce the level of attrition so theres not a tremendous amount of revenue at risk if we do not bring in new team members now within our guidance for this year with the reduction in expenses we are still planning to add new producers into our highgrowth areas whether thatd be marketspecific whether itd be in our wholesale banking area whether itd be in specialty or just the middlemarket banker so we are continuing to invest broadly in talent that can give us the proper returns and well do that but the million is not predicated on a bunch of new hires to be able to get there brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you for that i appreciate you taking my questions and all the time this morning everyone kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator the next question comes from steven duong of rbc capital markets steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just wanted to talk about your excess liquidity i think its around billion whats the pace that we should expect that to wind down each quarter and are you planning just to redeploy that into the securities book andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so its a great question and one we debate daily as we look at and think about what to do with excess liquidity first off our base case forecast would have deposits declining we didnt give official guidance on that because its highly uncertain to look at future stimulus possibilities the paycheck protection program round two all of those could materially impact deposits and so its difficult to know exactly what thatll look like this year as we mentioned earlier we do expect to increase the securities portfolio in the fourth quarter we were between to of total assets in the securities portfolio in i would expect to grow that to between to of total assets with the majority of that happening in the first quarter and so we will deploy some of that excess liquidity there as kevin mentioned we do believe that we have opportunities in our thirdparty lending portfolio that is a portfolio that we view as a surrogate for the investment portfolio and so the way we think about that is we get increased spread in exchange for incremental risk and that incremental risk is credit liquidity and marketability and with what we experienced in with the sale of the student loan portfolio realization of a gain there with the restructuring of our largest thirdparty relationship that derisked that portfolio all of that just tells us that we really think that we have a strong framework in this portfolio and it truly is a surrogate for the investment portfolio so as kevin mentioned thats an opportunity for us to consume some of this excess liquidity but thats how were thinking about it obviously the number one priority is customer growth and thats our first and foremost objective steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate that and the thirdparty portfolio that was around million in the fourth quarter is that right andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right and steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc and so that could increase going forward if you want to redeploy the excess liquidity synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right thats right as you look at as kevin mentioned on we were right at billion in third party loans on balance sheet and right now youre spot on at over million just over million on loans held for investment on balance sheet we also have the heldforsale portfolio but we view that differently thats a different risk profile and so we have really reduced the loans on balance sheet in the hfi portfolio and we believe that theres definitely opportunity to grow that portfolio in steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc so i guess maybe just an extension of this by the fourth quarter do you expect your excess liquidity to be around billion andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp its a challenging thing to forecast just given all the different flows and how we see i believe that liquidity will remain elevated were going to do everything we can to manage that including reducing broker deposits that we thought about earlier but i think itd be pretty tough to give a good answer for the fourth quarter of excess liquidity steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc no fully understand that and then just the last one just on the million revenue benefit from synovus forward about how much of that is coming from fees versus nii kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so in the first round we said it would be million we have three primary initiatives in there number one is our pricing for value as i said on the call about million of the benefit there will come in through fee income through repricing to market levels our treasury payment solution solution the second is on new product offering that weve rolled out merchant services we brought it inhouse and so that will all be feeincome related and then the third and the more difficult one to assess is this commercial analytics where we put a million benefit there that comes from crossselling and reducing attrition and so crossselling to our existing book could come from extending additional credit it could come from depository so there will be an nii component but a large component of the ability to crosssell will be on the treasury and payment solutions side i think about of the leads that we get out of this system are treasury and payment solutions related so i would assume that a large portion of that revenue will also come in through the service charge line or fee income line steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it its very helpful thank you thats it for me operator the next question comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks just a quick one i know you talked about the ma environment and not being interested in that im just curious from a perhaps venture capital or just general investment standpoint does fintech interest you at all from that deployment of cash you have some unique history in payments in fintech thats why i asked andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah chris ill jump in on that this is jamie as we look at those youre right we have a very unique history and a unique expertise and so that definitely plays into it but a lot of times when you look at the financials and the valuations its challenging to make those work to bring it into a bank because generally and not always but generally their valuation is based on their ability to sell to other banks and if you bring it inhouse it makes that difficult and the value to the buyer is a fraction of what the value is of that company when they can sell across the country and so thats typically what makes the math difficult but is the type of thing that we look at as kevin mentioned earlier if there is technology that we can deploy to serve our customers better to add a product that is definitely something we would consider its just you have to find the right fit to make the valuation work christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah great points i appreciate the color thank you all for the information this morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks chris operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kessel stelling for any closing remarks kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp well thank you very much and thanks to everyone for your

overcome it has been inspiring to again watch our bankers our advisors and support teams kick into action caring for each other and those we serve this might have been our finest hour so far and theres so much more to come were looking confidently towards the future with the right talent and the right growth strategies leading the way to become an even better bank and were just so wellpositioned for and the years beyond with a strong balance sheet with higher levels of capital and liquidity and strong credit quality with a strong operating model synovus financial corp snv
