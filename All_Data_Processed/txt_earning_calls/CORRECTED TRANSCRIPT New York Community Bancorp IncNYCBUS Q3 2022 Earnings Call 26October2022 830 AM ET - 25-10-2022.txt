before diving into the quarterly results and in anticipation of questions i just want to say that neither new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 new york community nor flagstar is going to comment on or address any questions regarding a pending merger on todays conference call with that being said lets turn now to our third quarter results overall the company had a solid third quarter despite aggressive fed tightening and an inverted yield curve still we produced solid loan and deposit growth lower operating expenses and continued strong levels of asset quality which remains our hallmark in terms of the net interest margin given our liabilitysensitive balance sheet not surprisingly we witnessed margin compression during the quarter however we still reported diluted earnings per share of excluding merger related expenses this was unchanged compared to the third quarter of last year and in line with consensus turning now to the main drivers of our quarterly performance after three consecutive quarters of doubledigit loan growth loan growth moderated as expected total loans held for investment rose nearly million during the quarter to billion compared to the previous quarter yeartodate total loans held for investments are now up billion or at annualized loan growth continues to be centered on the multifamily specialty finance portfolios at september the multi family portfolio totaled billion representing strong growth both on a yeartodate and a linkedquarter basis multifamily loans increased million sequentially and billion or annualized since the beginning of this year we continued to take market share in the multifamily space the recent survey by sp global market intelligence ranked nycb as the second largest multifamily portfolio lender nationally and we believe we are by far the largest multifamily portfolio lender in our nonluxury rentregulated lending niche in the new york city market specialty finance loans also continued to increase up million to billion compared to the previous quarter and up million or annualized so far in as of the third quarter specialty finance had total commitments of billion up compared to billion at the end of the second quarter of the current third quarter amount or approximately billion are structured as floating rate obligations tied to either prime or sofr which have and will continue to benefit the company in a rising interest rate environment i would also point out that as of the end of the third quarter we had approximately billion of multifamily and cre loans which come up onto their contractual maturity or option repricing date over the next two years this includes multifamily loans of and an average weighted average coupon of billion and billion of cre loans with an average weighted average coupon of going forward our loan yield should benefit from low coupon loans repricing to higher current market rates in terms of this pipeline as we head into the fourth quarter it stands at a robust billion compared to billion in the previous quarter of this amount represents new money to the bank on a liability front we also grew our deposits during the quarter despite higher interest rates which led to outflows in certain categories total deposits increased million compared to the previous quarter and that increased billion or annualized so far during to nearly billion as youve heard me discuss many times over the past months the focus is on and will continue to be on deposit gathering last year we reemphasize bringing in more deposits from our borrowings and we also launched our bankingasaservice initiative we are pleased with the success we have gotten with those two programs and expect they will continue to be the primary drivers of our deposit growth going forward on a year todate basis loanrelated deposits were up just under million at annualized since we started refocusing on its deposit channel during the first quarter of total loanrelated deposits have increased billion or about additionally business operating accounts of of total loanrelated deposits new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 bankingasaservice deposits totaled billion at third quarter our baas deposits fall generally into three key verticals traditional baas which totals billion in deposits mortgageasaservice which caters to mortgage banking and servicing companies totaling billion and government bankingasaservice which cater states and municipalities as well as the us treasuries preloaded debit card program totaling million mortgageasaservice and governmentasaservice are two verticals expected to drive card growth within the overall bankingasaservice segment recently the company won two new baas mandates both of these should result in fee income and deposit growth opportunities for the company moving on to one of the companys hallmarks credit our asset quality and credit trends remain superb and continue to rank the company as among the best in the industry nonperforming assets totaled million down million compared to million in the prior quarter and were basis points of total assets additionally we recorded zero net chargeoffs during the current third quarter compared to million of net recoveries last quarter the strong asset quality measures reflect our conservative underwriting practices and historically low level of losses in our core portfolios before moving on to the next topic id like to provide a brief update on a new york city real estate environment new york city residential real estate remains healthy and commercial real estate continues to gradually improve monthly median rents for manhattan multifamily apartments jumped yearoveryear to about to the third highest on record median rents appear to have stabilized at record high levels as well turning now to the commercial side average retail asking rents in manhattan recorded a quarterly uptick rising for the first time since the fourth quarter of manhattan third quarter office leasing surged to a post pandemic high this was driven by several large relocations and the continuing flighttoquality trend particularly in midtown also the manhattan availability rate decreased to with positive absorption for the first time in quarters new york city office occupancy increased in september likely due to many large companies urging their employees to return to office similarly there was a significant increase in mta ridership seated diners in new york city evidence in continuing strength in new york city economic activity each of these drivers are evidence of continuing strength in the new york city economy moving on now to the income statement third quarter net interest income totaled million up million or on a yearoveryear basis excluding the impact from prepayment penalty income net interest income on a non gaap basis increased million or to million on a yearoveryear basis in terms of the net interest margin excluding the impact from prepayments third quarter nim declined basis points on a linkedquarter basis to this was due to a higher cost of funds given aggressive fed policy tightening on the expense front our noninterest expense remained in check despite continuing to make investments non interest expense totaled million during the third quarter which includes million of mergerrelated expenses excluding this item operating expenses were million down million compared to the previous quarter and up on a yearoveryear basis at yesterdays meeting the board of directors declared a dividend on common shares the dividend will be paid on november to common shareholders of record as of november based on yesterdays closing stock price this translates into an annualized dividend yield of new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 with that we would be happy to answer any questions you may have we will do our very best to get all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or the week or during the week operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc morning i guess the first maybe lets start with the margin outlook in terms of what you expect to happen in the fourth quarter and give us some color around if you could your views around one where you see the margin ph troughing if you assume the forward curve plays out as is over the next few quarters and then anything in terms of the baas deposits that helps you mitigate that margin pressure so yeah thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sorry ebrahim im going to pass on the question on the margin to our cfo mr pinto john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah on the margin front when we look at the fourth quarter what we expect and well talk about it in really two different ways right if we assume the flagstar deal would have closed on october well look at what the impact of that transaction would be so when you look at where we start from the third quarter exprepay at we would be up basis points in the fourth quarter thats our forecast with flagstar closing on october exclusive of flagstar we expect the margin exprepay to be around so down basis points on a standalone basis slightly better than what we did in the third quarter so the impact of flagstar for the fourth quarter were looking at a basis point benefit when you look at margin exprepay the baas deposits we talk about the baas deposits as we talked about them in the last couple of calls they are primarily floating rate right and they have high betas especially the mortgageasaservice deposits their beta is very close to the other deposits are a little less than that when you look at some of the other bankingasaservice deposits that weve brought in so were monitoring that the goal is of course to bringing other operating accounts tied to those and continue to build out those relationships and also to build out the government as a deposit relationship thats where the benefit hopefully were going to see when those deposits start to come in because those are noninterest bearing deposits thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 hey ebrahim its tom i just add that that has started weve we were awarded a very significant government asaservice contract which kicked in at the end of october that is certainly significant as we go into the period ahead in addition to that we have a number of wins on the government side thats possibly kick in in addition to that in so were excited about the impact of that because that is all zerocost deposits ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and john just going back to your margin outlook ex prepay do you expect the cost of deposit increase that we saw this quarter to accelerate next quarter or because of some of these deposit dynamics we expect that to be a little more tempered versus the third quarter increase john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes i mean we saw that the third quarter was difficult from a deposit beta perspective no doubt we expect with these government deposits to come in that that will get a little bit better or hopefully stabilize at those at that third quarter level ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just one question i appreciate on what you mentioned about the deal up front but clearly you still think its you still expect to close the deal based on what john said and what you have in your slide deck given the change in the macro has anything changed from your perspective and im not sure if anyone from flagstars on the line that would make you think differently about the strategic merits of the deal today or november versus when the deal was announced thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc let me be clear in my opening comments relatively clear were not going to speak specifically about the pending merger however as far as going back to our discussion of the transaction itself were very comfortable that the business combination is powerful opportunity for two companies to come together and build a newco that has good diversity a tremendous unique opportunity on deposit side on funding and give us an opportunity to transition to commercial banking enterprise were excited about that im not going to be specific about the transaction itself but clearly when we came out with this partnership and i know sandro and lee are on the line that we were very very positive about the concept of putting these balance sheets together ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sandro do you want to add anything sandro alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc did you reference me tom new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i know it did reference if you want indiscernible sandro and lee are on the line but sandro by all means feel free to alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yes sure thanks tom and thanks for the question ebrahim look if this was flagstar as earnings call i would start out by telling you that its the best quarter weve ever had not the most profitable quarter but the best quarter because if you look at our margin nine years ago it was under and virtually all of our income came from mortgage our margin now is over with the far majority of it coming from banking weve got a highquality loan portfolio weve got efficient funding and while much smaller due to market conditions were still profitable in our mortgage business where many originators are not and that mortgage business will be there to take full advantage of the next refinancing market which will come we dont know when but it will come and on top of all that we have a very formidable servicing business and when you look at our expenses weve been able to manage them to revenues our efficiency ratios have declined pretty significantly so if given the opportunity getting back to your question combining this company with nycb taking what they do well running the similar playbook that weve run as weve rebuilt flagstar im excited about our ability to produce something very very special going forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just one sandro since you mentioned it was one of the best quarters of flagstar pardon my lack of familiarity but it sounds like your outlook for margin is relatively flat next quarter versus this quarter alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yes yes ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc is that implying that again speak to the cycle alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc well ebrahim what we how we try to structure our balance sheet viewing ourselves as an independent organization is we feel very comfortable with a margin with our business model so given what we believe we can get out of mortgage in this environment what we believe we can get out of servicing in this environment and the servicing piece of it is pretty certain and margin on top of a clean loan book i think the bottom line number feels really good so at this point i think the challenge is managing the betas on the deposit side in a way that doesnt compromise the margin going forward because theres going to be margin pressure and theres no question about it but i think that were very comfortable at flagstar that we can hang in there in that range going forward so thats new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 my outlook i mean we only give you outlook for the next quarter but were confident about that at least for the next quarter and i think overall as i said given our business model that thats a margin that works very well for us ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes its good thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from line of bernard vongizycki with deutsche bank please proceed with your question bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hi bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so my first question is so you still had good growth in multifamily portfolio but as you noted it moderated but it seems in line with expectations im just wondering with the rates continuing to rise is there a level of rates where that could drive growth to peers who might be pricing maybe a bit more aggressively like the agencies thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc its interesting its been a very interesting pipeline going into q4 q3 is typically a seasonality quarter for us q4 pipelines is relatively strong the coupon is extremely strong given the i mean if you look on a yearoveryear comparison basis we are going for a market to a market overnight which is powerful towards repricing this book of business so weve anticipated moderate growth in the second half of we probably grew a little bit better than we expected as we go into the pipeline so our overall net loan growth for the year is still going to come in around to so even if were at the consistent level of third quarter which is unlikely given fourth quarter activity typically the a robust activity in general coming off of a seasonality quarter of q3 so its been an interesting opportunity here given where the agencies are today where the shape of the curve is and i think in general most portfolio lenders are getting good economics and i think the opportunity here is moving that coupon from the low to the market which is significantly higher than low so were excited about whats coming due weve offered some unique options for our customers that are going into the repricing period and were trying to move our balance sheet to more interest rate risk to an interest rate risk compatible towards getting away from liability sensitivity to asset sensitivity and offering sofr options has been a well received option for our customers and it seems like a high percentage of those customers are opting for a sofr option and well then well work on moving our balance sheet to more asset sensitivity i think that sets us very well to look at this large book of business towards more of a sofr option in a rising rate environment new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 and as far as the agency is concerned i think in the long run as we focus on merger plans we are going to have a capital markets tool that will allow us to be more competitive were going to be able to offer an option that could continue on a derivative perspective to do longterm financing and take those fixed rate loans and swap them out to floating rate so i think thats going to be another competitive opportunity on the benefits of the merger so were looking forward to the capital markets benefit and that also comes with some fee income opportunity as well so were still very very bullish about valuations and sponsorships but were also cognizant that things have slowed down because of the substantial interest rate increases that happen in such a short period of time going from in the beginning year to at the market is a big move so we should benefit on repricing the portfolio which could really bode well for future margin benefits bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great i appreciate that color and then obviously i understand about the commentary on the pending deal but i was just wondering recently you filed some s and you provided a better snapshot of some of the assumptions from the time of the deal announcement to and of this year i was just wondering could you provide us any updates on your tangible book value or earnings accretion estimates or anything you can comment on that thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so when we announced the deal on the tangible book value side we were accretive when we looked at it and we talked about it in june that tangible book accretion jumped pretty dramatically its almost probably or our estimate now is at it has come back down around that level and its really just due to the purchase accounting adjustments given the changes in interest rates but its highly dependent on where those where interest rates are at the day of closing so thats where we look at it were still probably right around that same level a little better than when we originally anticipated the deal bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it that you said is as of john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right all right great thank you so much new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys for the nim guidance what are you guys assuming for those puttable borrowings rolling into new structures and then what are you rolling those into at this point john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so we had a handful of puttable borrowings put back to us in the third quarter and then well have some that were forecasting a large portion of them to get put back given where rates are today in the fourth quarter and were using were hoping to fund it with deposits of course but any shortfall on the deposit side will backfill with fhlb advances well put some swap funding on depending on where those levels are the puttable market is still out there so we could look at some puttables as we go forward as well so its really a mix of different liability structures that well look to refinance those puttables into as they come back to us from an interest rate risk perspective youre taking off money with under a threemonth duration whatever you put it on youre going to gather a little bit interest rate risk benefits in both the third and the fourth quarter by putting that out a little bit longer thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc dave i would just add to that commentary that given the government project that we just started to book recently in october thats going to be significant for the quarter so it could be on average in the billions between billion to billion on average for the quarter that would be at a cost of funds thats the middleclass tax refund prepaid ph collect program that were involved in thats a very good piece of business for the bank and we will be able to leverage that opportunity as we look at the repricing mechanism and in the big picture if you think about the balance sheets certainly on the assumption of coming together with our potential partnership with flagstar we have optionality as we choose how we want to move this balance sheet forward in the future and thats going to be a very unique opportunity at the time as we assume we can put these balance sheets together thats a really powerful position to be when it comes to having significant optionality on funding so this is something were focusing on a daily basis its fourth quarter and were excited about the new government piece of business thats coming on as well as the potential of balance sheet consolidation which will give us some significant choices as we embark upon a transformational opportunity here david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah so does that basis points of pressure does that include the billion to billion in deposits that youre hoping to get or expecting to get in the fourth quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think that would also assume ph and actually go and get into the probably in the september john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes correct yes thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so just following consensus of the forward curve david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it and then that also bakes in flagstars expectations that the margin does not go up in the fourth quarter as well i would guess right john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay cool and then just going back to the deal accretion what were you guys saying is your updated math on the earnings accretion that youre expecting to get from that i heard you on the tangible book part i just i may have missed the earnings accretion piece thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah we havent given we havent really commented on updated guidance on earnings accretion because it was really based originally on ibes estimates and ibes estimates now will have consolidated deals in them so the deal is still accretive we dont see any need to change that guidance were pretty comfortable with whats out there so we havent specifically updated that from deal announcement david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got you and whats your updated interest rate sensitivity if you closed the deal on october john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 yeah so if we close the deal on october right now were estimating would be slightly assetsensitive but pretty close to neutral david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then maybe just one last one on expenses how are you thinking about or just the year overall and you got the annual guidance out there any updated thoughts there john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes i mean the annual guidance of million i think will come in a little better we did a little better this quarter with managing expenses i would assume the fourth quarter will be right around that million million range thats kind of where weve been so yeah i think well do a little better from a year perspective than we did from our original estimate at million but the fourth quarter i see coming in around that million level david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thanks dave operator thank you our next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning john and tom i want to ask you just about the liquidity figures from the last quarterly call report it seemed that you had a very low level of ph cloud securities a lot of potential collateral in fact some of those measures work better now than it would have been prepandemic so standalone is anything changed as the end of september and do you see any i guess ability to add more debt if you wanted to on the balance sheet thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc ill start and ill pass it on to john bottom line is in the quarter we looked at heavy liquidity position and put it into short term us treasuries inside of six months so that being said there was an opportunity to take a lower yield in cash and move it into a well call it category which is almost consistent with cash which is six month treasury bills inside of that as a strategic move as we saw rates significantly rise here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 and john if you want to add anything more to that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes that so thats where youll see the securities portfolio increase for us which we havent seen in a very long time that is just putting on as tom mentioned us treasury securities six months or under just trying to pick up some yield based on what we could get at the fed at the time collateral wise its just as good as cash liquidity just as good of course as high quality liquid assets so thats what that was were not looking to put duration on in that portfolio yet well continue to monitor that but with the strong loan growth that weve had we havent had a need for that so that growth in the securities portfolio is really a liquidity just a liquidity play from cash to securities christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and then just a followup question on the bankingasaservice deposits as you look beyond a couple quarters i know these are high beta for the moment but is there any issue with retaining those funds or do you think actually that their retention is going to be high and theyll just theyll behave differently as rates move around next year thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so i indicated in my prepared remarks that were going to anticipate governmentasaservice to ramp up here it takes a while to get these contracts nailed down and put in place and they are longterm contracts so we have a nice book of business of business going forward we indicated that we have a very significant rampup in q4 i think its about million or million a week in cash drops and it could go up to about billion for one transaction thats a significant piece of business at the same time we are the bank provider for us treasury and as any programs that come out of the treasury department we are now onboarding that its a longterm contract were very pleased about our partnership with first data and fiserv so its been a very good opportunity for the bank to use that type of funding at the same time were committed to mortgageasaservice i think theres great opportunity on a planned merger with flagstar and we think theres a great opportunity there to build that so that is probably more high beta because it is tied to sofr index type funding but were committed to that because were going to be a large player assuming the transaction closes and when we come together that mortgageasaservice business could be very powerful as we work a lot of the corresponding customers when it comes to traditional baas were out there working hard on working trying to get new business and its been a good journey for us but i think in general were focused on the three verticals and ultimately as we look at digitization as a company theres a tremendous opportunity to digitize the mortgage space and thats where i think great opportunity will come and even though its not tied to traditional baas but our team in digital are focusing on a lot of projects thats going to hopefully lean towards some good deposit growth we think theres a tremendous deposit opportunity on mortgage having the ability to transact loans service loans and get these deposit activity i think thats a tremendous benefit of the planned merger with flagstar the mortgageasa service is going to be a focus as well new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you tom and thank you john appreciate the feedback this morning thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve q hi good morning this is ph alex on for steve thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning alex q good morning you mentioned the benefits from the bankingasaservice business do you expect any investments needed to scale this business and get those new opportunities thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so were going to be very mindful of what our requirements are here so weve been adding staff we have built out the chief digital office directly reporting to the ceo i think as a priority this is an interesting opportunity as indicated mortgage in our opinion given the history of nycb and flagstar theres a lot of longterm history there on how to service the escrow account the ph pi payment so that is embedded within the franchise within our operating people but were going to move people around and were going to make sure we have the right support for these lines of businesses i will tell you the challenges is onboarding some of the unique opportunities in traditional baas because obviously it takes time and its api interfacing within the core and were working on new opportunities within the core that can make it a lot more efficient but we are staffing that area and moving people around within the organization i think thats also its great when you put two big companies together and think about opportunities within the organization there are going to be opportunities in the organization to shuffle people around to support growth of different verticals within the company new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 and our vertical here on the funding side is going to transition from wholesale to more of a traditional type funding mechanism and part of that will be baas in particular governmentasaservice has been its been a long trajectory of getting them onto the balance sheet we had a good run during the pandemic and we were very successful there that let us into other opportunities but we have a bunch of transactions that weve won and we plan on onboarding so i think could be a nice pickup year on very core stable accounts although theyre not permanent because they do move on but we do have the opportunity for an ongoing benefit of good funding sources as we look at the planned merger as we look at our choices on balance sheet and look at this one vertical as a clearly a different funding mechanism a traditional nontraditional funding that nycb is accustomed to moving from a thrift to a commercial bank is the strategy as sandro indicated hes been through his journey and we hope to do this together and thats a very powerful change when you look at funding so like i said in my opening remarks funding funding funding were focused on that were razorfocused on that you see a significant shift on our ability to bring in deposits so were going to continue q thank you and you touched on this briefly earlier but can you talk about the fee opportunities that youre seeing from this bankingasaservice business as well thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc id say initially it varies just on card fees its not significant but they do add up when you have million to million cards out there a couple of pennies per card per month it adds up its not significant to the total pl but we are seeing some nice fee income opportunities there and its consistent as we onboard more municipalities more states throughout the country well have more consistency of fee income so its another avenue that were focusing to justify the investment in the business q thanks and a followup to the comment you mentioned about the multifamily and commercial real estate loans repricing can you talk about the market rates for those loans and maybe specialty loans as well thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yes so on the specialty side its mostly sofrplus the spread has been consistent about of our book is floating rate were doing predominately mostly floating rate structure in the specialty the real credit buyup opportunities at very high high highquality senior secured position weve been in this business for a while now and our team that runs it has done an excellent job weve never had a late pay we never had a chargeoff you never had a delinquency so were really positive of the asset quality of that but its been a good growth business we have quite a bit of commitment out there so in the event that markets do have some volatility theres a possibility that therell be some good drawdowns well make some good money on the drawdowns so we think that may happen given the uncertainty of markets in the current environment today in respect to the cre and multi its been a very significant increase in total interest rate cost to the borrower so going from to is real so were around that level right now its about to what the five year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 treasury thats been the traditional shortterm type multifamily product were really not quoting much on the backend on and 7year money but if we do do that its a higher spreads and was going to hopefully synthetically structure that if you want to put on balance sheet so we can have a better interest rate risk profile going forward and on the cre side tack another basis points to that so youre in the mid right now to the market so thats a sizable change as indicated with the coupons in the going to the with a lot of money that has to re price weve offered a sofr option i think thats a good option for customers versus locking in fixed it may take a oneyear approach towards floating and hope that rates may come down in the future but were giving that option to customers and its been about a close to receptivity with that as long as they are actually repricing in the periods we think thats going to bode well for our future interest rate risk management opportunity when we think about the combined balance sheets going forward q thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens inc please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc

executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats on total and ph recurring deposits new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood thank you okay and then if the fed starts hiking in early do you have any idea on where and perhaps when after the fed stops hiking you could see the core nim stabilize for new york community standalone thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so matt were not going to get forward guidance but obviously if that does take place its positive for a liability sensitive balance sheet ex the consolidation of flagstar so clearly on a standalone basis were running at the dot plot were planning for continuing hikes and were prepared for that but in the event as they pivot i think thats going to be a positive shift on a standalone basis for our business model on a combined basis wed have an opportunity to really think about where we want to put our balance sheet look at the transformational opportunity here and set the balance sheet for whats prepared for the future and i think thats the real excitement of the upside but in the event that we look on a standalone basis were prepared for the forward dot plot and is a period where we have rising interest rates continuing i think for the first quarter then eventually going down towards the back end of and with that being said well prepare for making sure that we have solid focus on deposit gathering were going to continue focusing on building out our funding mechanism here as we grow the institution and culturally theres been a drive towards we make loans with deposits were not going to make the loans to customers that are not going to bring the deposits thats been a cultural shift here thats been successful as we talked about some of the other initiatives its all about deposits deposits deposits as we go forward here on our vision as we transition from a thrift to a commercial bank with the acceleration of putting together two balance sheets where in sandros perspective he has been working on this for quite some time and you can see the results he is showing a very strong margin because of the assets are all repricing and its funding is very different than our funding matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay and then just going back to the deal what is the estimated first year accretion from the deal and then at the current price what is the expected bargain purchase gain john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so well start out the the bargain purchase gain is really highly dependent on two things right the final purchase accounting marks and the stock price at the day of closing so we estimated as of given where we think the marks will come out and assuming a current stock price were just under a million bargain purchase gain is our estimate like i said those two items will be the driver really along with of course the equity growth in the quarter on the flagstar balance sheet so thats our estimate right now moves around pretty significantly depending on stock price and the final purchase accounting mark thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc rates yeah new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah due to interest rates of course we really havent updated our guidance i think i mentioned earlier on earnings accretion from the deal so were at that level that we announced originally so we havent really updated that as weve gone along we still believe the deal is highly accretive especially in this marketplace thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah im going to say one point to that the energy level and the time spent on analyzing the pl and how these companies work together were pretty confident on our original cost savings estimates and if anything having this excess time to really understand how these processes work together we feel very confident on what our estimates were on cost savings for sure matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then just the merger termination date is less than a week away can you just talk about expectations for the deal if approvals are not obtained by then thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc as indicated i apologize for reiterating my opening remarks were not going to discuss the pending merger transaction in respect to timing matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay all right thats all i had thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning i want to go back to a comment sandro made earlier about theyre excited the optimism around the deal i think the quote was if given the opportunity that to me reads regulators just slowplaying the approvals you both are on the call today so it feels like the commitment from both parties is there i guess maybe a comment is that the right kind of read john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so i guess youre addressing this to sandro or youre asking to mr cangemi new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc yeah well if its me yes my comment i dont think you should read anything into it every earnings call weve had weve always talked about what we think the opportunity is and so were being consistent with what we said previously the regulatory process is what it is and were going to continue to work towards what would it what would what it would be if we get an approval until such time as we dont get one so were still focused on it but no i dont think you should read anything into any of our comments today other than were still hopeful because we see that the as we always have weve seen that the opportunity and power of the combined organization is really something special christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you for that color just on the dividend obviously youre comfortably earning it now but maybe thoughts pro forma on the dividend i guess with or without flagstar thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so look we have a long history here of a very strong dividend and its a very focused capital management process we are very comfortable with asset quality were very comfortable with how we look at our capital deployment and going forward we feel very strongly that well continue to pay a very strong dividend and obviously this has been our history and culture of the company going back for decades so were very confident company had record earnings going into this in the beginning of the first half of this year were seeing some margin pressure based on substantial movements on fed action however over time this company will navigate through it and we will have strong asset quality and foster a on a standalone basis a very focused expense management philosophy to generate good returns to our shareholders at a very strong dividend so thats always been our culture on a projected combined basis we just earn more money christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks thomas robert cangemi a chairman
