approximately billion in total assets billion in total deposits and million in loans approximately of the deposits are noninterest bearing this acquisition increases fnbs presence in north carolina to a top deposit share in the state this region has proven to be a growth engine for fnb adding the lowcost granular deposits will also benefit our financial performance in a rising rate environment we are excited about our prospects and we welcome the ub bancorp team and customers to fnb overall the second quarter provided solid financial results and fnb is wellpositioned in the current macroeconomic environment one of fnbs core strength is our credit performance which has been proven in the economic downturn in and again during the recent pandemic gary and our team take a proactive approach to managing the banks credit portfolio and collectively offer decades of experience ill now turn the call over to gary to provide more detail on our asset quality and comments on the economic environment gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone our credit results for the second quarter showed continued positive performance with our key credit metrics trending favorably as we enter the second half of the year in a position of strength we saw lower past due and nonperforming levels during the quarter as well as a decline in rated credits and loan loss levels all of which contributed to a further strengthening of our credit portfolio well first review our gaap asset quality highlights for the second quarter and later in my remarks ill provide an update on howard bank and the recently announced ub bancorp acquisition as well as some brief commentary on the macroeconomic environment and how were managing those potential risks lets now look at our results for the second quarter total delinquency ended june at a historically low level of basis points down bps over the prior quarter which was driven by improvements in the commercial portfolios the earlystage past due in nonaccrual levels npls and oreo also declined on a linkedquarter basis down basis points to end june at a solid bps net chargeoffs for q2 ended in a net recovery position of or minus basis point annualized and for the yeartodate period net chargeoffs totaled million or basis point annualized we recognized provision expense of million which supported strong loan growth in the quarter and also reflects lower prepayment speed assumptions in our seasonal cecl model this resulted in an ending june reserve of million or of loans at quarterend which represents a 3basis point decrease versus the prior quarter remaining directionally consistent with our favorable credit quality results our npl coverage position remains strong at fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 id now like to provide a brief update on the howard portfolio and the recently announced ub bancorp acquisition as it relates to howard the credit portfolio has not had a material impact to our overall credit metrics and that it continues to perform well and inline with our expectations we remain pleased with the transition process and continue to track the portfolio closely as is our standard practice in the quarters following an acquisition we also recently announced the acquisition of ub bancorp which will further position us in the carolinas and offer additional lending and crosssell opportunities in these attractive markets regarding the loan portfolio we estimated a credit mark at at due diligence as the book continues to perform inline with our expectations with no material impact expected to our credit metrics we look forward to expanding our client relationships and our range of products that will be available to ub bancorps customer base i would now like to turn your attention to the economy and our approach to managing risk in this environment of accelerated inflation rising interest rates elevated energy costs and ongoing labor and supply chain challenges these economic headwinds remain at the forefront of our credit decisioning process to understand and mitigate economicdriven risks and challenges faced by our borrowers many of our commercial banking customers have exercised interest rate hedging options as part of our derivative program which enables them to reduce rate sensitivity and lower their borrowing costs moving into this environment on the direction of the broader economy and competitive lending environment all remains to be seen in the quarters ahead we remain committed to our standard practice of consistent and sound underwriting across the entire footprint as well as ongoing and proactive monitoring of our book to identify early signs of current or potential future stress by leveraging our robust data analytics framework we can monitor credit trends and performance metrics for all products and lines of business allowing us to better manage emerging risks quickly and comprehensively across the entire loan portfolio in summary we had a strong quarter marked by continued improvement in our credit quality reduced rated credit levels solid highquality loan growth and strong positioning of our portfolio headed into the secondhalf of the year that said we continue to remain cautious on the forwardlooking economy as we enter a possible recessionary phase our focus remains on the continued disciplined approach to our core credit fundamentals that have served us well throughout prior economic cycles i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary good morning everyone today i will focus on second quarters financial results and offer guidance for the third quarter and fullyear of overall the second quarter financials capture the strong performance of fnb with reported net income available to common shareholders totaling million or earnings per share of after adjusting for million of mergerrelated expenses net income reached million or per share balance sheet growth is very strong and excluding ppp period end total loans increased billion or annualized on a linkedquarter basis including an annualized increase in consumer loans and in commercial commercial loan growth was led by commercial and industrial annualized growth of excluding ppp the majority of the quarters growth was concentrated in june which will benefit the third quarter average balance additionally commercial line of credit utilization increased to linkedquarter with expectations that it will continue to build through the end of the year consumer loan growth was driven by strong organic residential mortgage and home equity lending activity as vince mentioned the physicians first mortgage program has been very successful making up twothirds of this quarters net growth in mortgage loans while the physicians first program is seasonal in nature we expect this highquality loan portfolio to continue to build another element of residential mortgage activity is shifting customer preferences for adjustable rate in mortgages in mortgage originations comprised of fixed rate and arms in the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 second quarter that ratio has transitioned to fixed rate and arms as customers optimized payment size given rising interest rates and increased home values on the income statement net interest income totaled a record million an increase of million or due to growth in average earning assets and benefits from the higher interest rate environment which was partially offset by a million decrease contribution from ppp as those balances wind down the net interest margin increased basis points this quarter to an area of heightened focus this quarter and for the next several quarters is deposit betas given the actions taken by the federal reserve knowing it is not an exact comparison our cumulative deposit beta the total deposits during the last interest rate hiking cycle from december of to december of was its important to keep in mind three main differences from the previous cycle first is that the federal reserve is hiking at a much faster rate than in secondly the emergence of high cost depositgathering fintechs and third our deposit mix is in a more favorable position today with noninterestbearing deposits at of total deposits and a much lower loantodeposit ratio at versus at the end of todate we have been able to effectively manage deposit costs while balancing deposit mix shifts that have occurred turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million a million or increase from last quarter capital markets income was million an increase of with solid contributions from swap fees international banking syndications and debt capital markets service charges increased million linkedquarter largely due to growth in interchange income and treasury management fees driven by higher customer transactions and new client acquisition a million increase in bankowned life insurance reflected life insurance claims received during the quarter mortgage banking operations income decreased million or as loan production to be sold in the secondary markets declined linkedquarter given the higher mortgage rates refinance activity only accounted for of our second quarter sold production compared to in the yearago quarter reported noninterest expense totaled million a decrease of million or on an operating basis noninterest expense decreased million or compared to the prior quarter excluding merger related expenses of million in the second quarter and mergerrelated expenses of million and branch consolidation costs of million in the first quarter of given these adjustments the rest of the expense fluctuations will be given on an operating basis salaries and employee benefits decreased million from last quarters seasonally higher longterm compensation expense of million and seasonally higher employerpaid payroll taxes marketing increased million as we expanded our digital advertising and launched campaigns for our physicians first program reflective of our diligent expense management the efficiency ratio came down to a significant improvement compared to the first quarters ratio of and the yearago quarters ratio of excluding ppp income the efficiency ratio actually improved over basis points on a yearoveryear basis tangible book value per common share was at june an increase of a per share from march while aoci reduced the current quarterend tangible book value per common share by compared to at the end of the prior quarter the higher level of earnings more than offset that impact the increased unrealized losses in the afs portfolio due to rising interest rates should accrete back into capital over time as securities mature or prepay our cet1 regulatory capital ratio declined approximately basis points to primarily due to the significant loan growth in the quarter as well as putting more cash to work through additions to our securities portfolio we would expect to manage this ratio higher throughout the remainder of the year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 now lets turn to guidance which excludes the announced ub bancorp acquisition given the strong loan growth this quarter we increased our fullyear guidance for loans to grow at a low to midteens growth rate with underlying organic growth in the high singledigits on a yearoveryear spot basis total deposits are projected to grow mid to highsingle digits on a yearoveryear spot basis fullyear net interest income is expected to be between billion and billion with the third quarter between million and million our guidance currently assumes 150basispoint of rate increases for the remainder of the year including a basispoint increase this month fullyear noninterest income is expected to be between million and million with the second sic third quarter in the high70 million area the revised noninterest income guidance is due to slightly lower mortgage banking income technical difficulty reduced marketrelated fee income there is no change to our guidance for noninterest expense on an operating basis in the range of million to million for the full year and million to million for the third quarter this does not include the one time expenses associated with acquisitions and branch consolidations positive credit quality is expected to continue throughout with provision guided to million to million this range does not include the initial million of provision related to howard and is dependent on net loan growth for the remainder of the year lastly the effective tax rate should be between and for the full year but is dependent on the level of investment tax credit activity with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince in summary our team delivered exceptional quarterly results in a fluid economic environment while fulfilling a number of key strategic objectives such as record loan growth record total revenue a return on tangible common equity solid efficiency ratio of with disciplined expense control and a dividend payout ratio at our team remains keenly focused on maintaining strong credit quality this quarter includes net recoveries and solid reserve coverage as you can see we have got many accomplishments already in which doesnt happen without the hard work and dedication of all of our employees i would like to offer my sincere gratitude to our employees who make our success possible with that ill turn the call over to the operator for your questions fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question will be from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared first on the loan growth which remains very impressive i guess just looking at the remainder of the year the compositions of the expected guide assuming much of that is coming from the commercial portfolio but maybe just talk through the composition gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of the loan growth timur were looking at good participation across all of the books of business each business line participated very nicely this quarter pipelines continued to remain solid were getting good participation across our geographies and from a consumer standpoint the pipelines albeit slightly down thats seasonal in nature pretty much the second quarter is really a seasonal event for us when you look at that consumer portfolio the mortgage book applications are down a little bit as well as you would expect so well see a little slower growth there but when you look across the board the ci continues to be solid cre as well with some seasonal slowness in that home equity and mortgage portfolio timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and as you look at the competitive landscape in the face of rising rates are you seeing incremental spread pressure as youre fighting for new business or does the diversified geography products that kind of help mitigate some of that gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania weve not seen additional spread pressure here of late actually the diversified geography helps from that standpoint but from a pricing standpoint weve seen some slight improvement there timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i guess as we go through the rest of the year and how youre thinking about funding the loan growth i appreciate the deposit guide obviously but as youre looking at funding that loan growth and the acquisition thats slated to close in the backend of the year the remaining onbalance sheet liquidity how does that all figure in is the expectation to kind of fund it oneforone is there incremental liquidity that youre willing to use on the balance sheet in advance of the deal closing later this year any color on the funding side would be helpful vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 the transaction that we closed this is vince delie if we are able to close the transaction this year well get a benefit because its principally a deposit play the deposit portfolio is fairly substantial for the size of the bank theres tremendous amount of granularity the cost of funds in that portfolio is low were bringing it over additionally at basis points growth indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean i think that that will be additive that will help us but if you look at where we are today were sitting at loantodeposit ratio we have in deposits our mix is the strongest its ever been our liquidity position while weve drawn down cash is still substantial i think were in a very good position relative to lending and achieving good returns in that space particularly commercial lending in the second half of the year so i think were in a really good place timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania from a funding perspective right were not concerned vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and i would just add i mean at the end of june we had million of kind of the excess cash still on the balance sheet so that was million at the end of the first quarter we obviously use that to fund the loan growth you saw on a spot basis so theres still ample liquidity just sitting right there for us vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we continue to win depository relationships particularly in the southeast thats starting to accelerate for us larger treasury management clients in the commercial segment so i would expect that to continue timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you and then just last for me on the securities book maybe talk through the purchases you were making this quarter and what youre seeing there for reinvestment yields vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure during the second quarter we invested million into the portfolio about million higher than the cash flows to take advantage of the rate environment that was there we reinvested in an average rate of a quarter that was last quarter so a significant move up there and its wellabove the rolloff rate of so a nice benefit there and if you look ahead i mean durationwise we continue to be on the shorter end weve fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 been around our estimated 12month cash flow is just under billion to be coming off at around so putting stuff on it they were probably putting stuff on this month more like timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you for the color appreciate it operator and the next question will be from daniel tamayo with raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thanks for taking my question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah i thought your comments on deposit rates were very interesting in terms of everything that could impact those this cycle relative to the prior cycles im not sure maybe i missed it but could you kind of just indicate where you think that they actually may shake out or what your best guess is or what youre budgeting for given all those factors that you mentioned vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure yeah obviously the level of liquidity in the banking system is still the duration to how this all is going to play out yeah at this point i would add that weve seen no pressure at all on the retail deposit side its really been conversations with municipal commercial customers that have started to ship funds from money market deposits into cds so thats kind of natural mix shift has been occurring if you look at where we are so far our cumulative betas is on total deposits on interestbearing deposits as of the end of june and then whats baked into our guidance based on what we know today for total deposits and interestbearing deposits by the end of the year will be the cumulative data at this point daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great appreciate that and then my other question is just around share repurchases you repurchased shares this quarter capital has been stable obviously you have the deal coming in the fourth quarter but just kind of overarching thoughts on outside of maybe the period where youre unable to repurchase how youre thinking about share repurchases is it more of a kind of a steady quartertoquarter amount that youre looking to repurchase or more opportunistic vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 i would start that we continue to target a cet1 ratio around in the level weve been discussing it did come down about basis points this quarter just given strong loan growth recent investments that i mentioned the advantages of higher yields and those are coming out of cash risk weighting so you have that dynamic happening during the quarter as we look ahead and its baked into our guidance we would expect that to get back up to by the end of the year just given our higher earnings generation levels the dividend payout ratio and our overall assetsensitive positioning regarding buybacks its kind of the same we talked about i mean our first and best use of capital is organic loan growth so the level of buybacks will be dependent on the growths we see for the rest of the year but well be opportunistic as we have been in the past we did buy million shares this quarter and if the opportunity makes sense ie on the loan growth indiscernible back and overall were going to just committed to managing capital in a way thats fully aligned with shareholder interest so its a constant evaluation for us daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great all right thats all i have i appreciate the answers gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator the next question is from michael perito with kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning indiscernible michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to just kind of start with a big picture question and you guys kind of talked around it in a few different ways in your prepared remarks and some of the questions that have been asked already but just like this this i guess balancing this environment with the kind of the uncertainty in the backhalf of the year versus what seems like like on the ground today like pretty good momentum from a loan growth standpoint customer growth standpoint i guess with your diverse footprint how do you guys think about balancing those two things and are there certain areas or whether its from a deposit beta side or a loan growth side like the credit side that you feel better about from a market standpoint today within your footprint are there areas where maybe youre more concerned whether thats because of real estate changes or anything like that just color there would be helpful fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania well first of all i think the diversification strategy that we pursued enables us to be more selective from a credit perspective that was the thesis that we laid out from the very beginning as we gained share in markets like pittsburgh it becomes more and more challenging to grow portfolios and not change the risk profile in that portfolio and there are competitors they have theyre wellentrenched here and while we were able to grow fairly significantly in a short timeframe you get to a point where you hit saturation for good quality credits and our philosophy was to stay within a tight underwriting range so that we werent inconsistent with cycles we did it the last time and we put together a number of linkedquarters where we had loan growth throughout the last economic cycle and i we were an outlier and i think that were even in a better position this time around applying our credit philosophy to an even broader diversification in terms of markets that we cover and i think that we have great bankers we have a very disciplined sales management process we have credit officers in the field we use data analytics and the tools we put into place to manage credit risk we look at trends within the portfolio our credit team the analytics side of it is very sophisticated we use all of that to kind of guide us and if you look at the exposures that we had going into the pandemic hospitality for example gary and his team had already managed down those exposures we have less than million in exposure and we kind of looked at that portfolio and looked at what was going on in the industry and set thresholds based upon our capital levels we looked at all of our exposures relative to capital and made adjustments and get it in a way that didnt that we werent exiting customers left and right we just decided we were going to swallow up our lending in that category and we had enough to go after geographically to continue to sustain the growth trajectory for the company thats how you manage risk through a cycle the other side of it is were very focused on whats happening with our customer base i mean were looking at the supply chain issues how is that going to impact growth and ebitda margin growth its really if the company has more leverage we look at that we look at interest rate sensitivity how will rising rates impact certain portfolios we look at changes that are going on from a commodity pricing perspective and how that will impact customers and then we pick what we think are great management teams to lend to and it sounds pretty basic but if you stick to that and you dont grab we dont we manage pipelines and we manage opportunities were not at this early managing growth and portfolios just to grow so i think the outcome is we ended up as weve always said with mid to highsingle digit growth in the portfolio and thats not to sustain us and to achieve on our principal investment piece vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania right thats the strategy and in the markets that we cover you could see some really substantial population growth in the southeast theres a lot of activity in the midatlantic region particularly in dc in portland and maryland we have pittsburgh and then cleveland that have bigger industrial bases where we see more opportunities on the ci side and charleston south carolina is a highgrowth market weve had great opportunities there to land principally in the real estate space but we also see ci opportunities there more and more because of the changes that are going on there anyway thats how we manage the risk and i cant say that im looking at a single but we stay out of were not an equitysponsored lender we dont just follow private equity perspective of whats going on so we try to stay out of those riskier portfolios we have sold portfolios even at times when we could have used the earning assets on the balance sheet because we were concerned about the risk so very prudently managed i think i fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 have all the confidence in the world in our team and i believe well be able to grow just like we have in other cycles i hope that helps michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay no it is thanks for expanding on it i appreciate that and then just secondly for me i mean you guys are kind of in this enviable position here where the loantodeposit ratio is still low and your cash is still almost of your earning assets right where weve seen some of your peers are starting to see some upward pressure on the loantodeposit and were a little bit quicker deploy that cash elsewhere whether it was loans or bonds but i guess longerterm right i mean its hard to be competitive from a profitability standpoint with so much with an loantodeposit of earning assets in cash right so i mean how do you guys think about that dynamic i mean obviously those are good things to have with the uncertain environment but presumably at some point they need to normalize like the roe that i think you guys cant so i mean how do you guys think about the timing of that evolution of the balance sheet just given everything thats going on vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well weve achieved pretty substantial profitability metrics at of loantodeposit ratio so im not sure it really depends on the interest rate environment and whats happened kind of globally but i will tell you that our consumer bank what differentiates us from many of our peers is theyre principally commercial banks its much much harder to grow deposits at certain points in the cycle when youre relying solely on commercial depositors so we again diversification we have a big chunk of our deposit base which sits in the consumer bank and weve had great success growing those deposits and the betas in those categories tend to be more favorable to the bank so i think thats we plan on continuing to pursue that to pursue those strategies that we put out there with our investment in technology the estore the number of deposit accounts that were opening online has gone up fairly significantly over time so our scalability in that consumer segment actually has improved right so i think were in a good position to grow deposits which i think is how banks should be measured good banks can grow their deposit base in a favorable way thats what makes them great so we focus on it and try to achieve better results and thats really a principal funding source for us i dont know if you want to add anything to that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would just add i mean the spot cash if you look at it at the end of the quarter was about of earning assets i think vince has made a reference point to so was kind of our high mark for loantodeposit ratio theres a lot of room between here and there so i think with the deployment of the cash in the short run and then like vince said our ability to generate deposits the geography we had and not just through acquisition but through de novo the bankers weve added treasury management team is out there getting wins every day i think that differentiated for us so that helps the fund the loan growth but in the short run we have the benefit of the cash and deposit growth continuing as we go forward with adding new accounts not just what we have on the balance sheet today that clearly benefit us for the long run vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 weve never been dependent heavily on a wholesale fund so and i think that there are times when cycle changes and maybe theres more of a need for it but weve never been solely dependent on it michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great that was all helpful thank you guys for spending time on those and i appreciate the color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thank you operator operator instructions the next question is from russell gunther with da davidson please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co yeah hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russ russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co just a brief followup on the deposit beta conversation i appreciate your views as to where things could shake out by the end of the year and likely the bulk of fed hikes will begin by that time but as the later ones work their way through do you have an updated view on sort of throughthecycle betas from a total and interestbearing perspective vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no well i think we have the reference point that we had in the prepared remarks to give you kind of a feel for that indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so the last cycle vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah so i mean sorry so i mean russell thats one reference point that we have and kind of getting to what were suggesting into our guidance for the end of the year depending on who you believe i mean the fed kind of peaks in third quarter and then starts to come down from there so i think what happened to the beta from there is going to be kind of interesting and for us to all manage fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 once rates start to come back down what happens to the beta is relative where deposit rates are at that time relative to where kind of the fed has moved to so our job is to balance it and manage it effectively i think that yearend point is a good reference point to have relative to what happened last time and well do our best to try to even be better than that russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thats helpful vince thank you and then just another followup sort of on the asset quality conversation appreciate your thoughts there results are really strong historically a lower beta model at fnb but as youve moved into growth with markets and increased the growth profile of the company has your view changed at all in terms of normalized losses and where you think that range of chargeoffs could shake out over the next year or two gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would tell you russell with our philosophy of consistent underwriting through the cycles which weve gone through a number of cycles at this point as you know i would expect that our chargeoffs and with the diversity of the book and the amount of credit opportunities that were seeing and choosing the highest quality opportunities in that list i would expect to see our normalized chargeoffs be lower than they were in the past we have taken some positions to move some positions from a balance sheet standpoint and with the consistency that weve seen and the highquality opportunities weve seen i would expect them to be slightly lower through the cycle russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co thank you for that gary and then just last one for me is a followup on the loan growth discussion vince you mentioned just kind of a longer term mid to highsingle digits but just getting back into the change in the growth profile the growth of your markets trying to balance that against some of the macro headwinds outlined earlier is a highsingledigit result something that you think is sustainable in the near term just even beyond the back half of this year just given that diversification and growth of your markets thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats a good question i wish i knew the answer i think as we look at it honestly as we look into the next year its going to be i think a little more challenging im not sure how much capital will be deployed by customers or consumers depending on whats happening with the us economy as things stand today it looks like and based on what im reading seeing all the other banks report there was kind of pentup demand for credit so kind of the flood just came in but i think theres a lot of uncertainty within the customer base about where were headed so theres a lot more caution at least im sensing that this is anecdotal im sensing theres a lot more caution within the customer base about capital investment moving into next year so my expectation would be that we had great results from those two quarters from a growth perspective the pipelines looked good theyre lower slightly because we did fund quite a bit but then im trying to think whats going to happen as we move forward well thats really a question about confidence confidence within the customer base how our customers feel particularly the commercial customers both cre and ci on if the environment is going to be ripe for a capital investment i mean theyre going to look at that and say thats going to drive indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 weve seen a little bit of benefit from the supply chain issues quite frankly some of the customers are trying to deal with inventory shortfalls so theyre starting to borrow a little bit we saw a slight uptick in utilization rates some of that is having a little extra inventory onhand so they can continue to grow right because their supply chain issues that put a lid on growth with those companies so they are trying to manage that you see commodity pricing they pushed up some of the revolvers a little bit because the cost of raw materials has gone up pretty dramatically for most industries all of thats going to come into play but i think demand for loans commercial loans in particular should i think will tail off a little bit we saw the flood come in and then next year is a big question mark based upon how were feeling later in the year collectively i hope that helps thats we just we manage it frequently we manage it creditbycredit groupbygroup so we have prospect lists and the falling activity and we just try to be there for the clients so when the capital opportunity comes up were one of the considered banks and deliver so hope that helps russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co yeah it does quite a bit thank you vince and thank you all for taking my questions vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell operator the next question is from brian martin from janney please go ahead brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc and maybe can you just touch on i guess you touched i thought maybe i missed it in your earlier comments but just about the commercial pipelines i know you said that consumer was down a little bit and you just mentioned vince now maybe a little bit more it sounds like the commercial pipelines are down a little bit so i dont know if thats gary or vince but just kind of what youre seeing there gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 well the commercial pipelines that we just went through it the enormous funding session so what ends up happening is the shortterm pipeline converts the assets on the balance sheet and then the longterm pipeline starts to fill back up again we look at it in two segments within days to close and greater than days really with few principal areas but when you look at it on a yearoveryear basis considering the growth weve had which is mostly seasonal our pipelines arent low historically theyre lower than they were at the beginning of the quarter slightly so let me be clear theres still opportunities within the pipeline weve cleared out the 90day bucket with good fundings brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the pipeline was actually up gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania its actually up slightly vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania commercial gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats the total in the end pipeline not the shortterm pipeline vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and then maybe just can you just talk a little bit about the just you talked about the betas just kind of the margin outlook given the sensitivity and kind of the rate increases were seeing here just kind of how youre thinking about the nearterm kind of whats repricing just remind us i thought that there was not much that had floors out there on the pipeline but just understanding the margin and sensitivity here just over the next quarter so vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah i would say higher i mean indiscernible has a lot of moving parts we gave guidance on margins in cash levels and all the indiscernible so the dollars in net interest income i think theyre the most helpful the floors are really insignificant i mean its under million of indiscernible not even something we talk about if you look at some of the key drivers remember brian that in the we still have that excess cash on the balance sheet and we have a slide there that quantifies that i mean thats a 16basis point drag on the margin in the second quarter so with that cash continues to get deployed that basis points will go away so again directionally that helps the percentage the purchase accounting and ppp benefits are basis point and basis point respectively thats going the other way theyre very low at this point and ppp will indiscernible and the purchase accounting i will probably say around that level so that basis point drag goes away with benefit to the percentage for sure some of the other kind of key drivers that we talked about in the past is the consumer cds we bought about ph to a month that are maturing from basis points to basis points and today in the month of june where we are were kind of cds on around basis points so theres that dynamic there if you look at the portfolio rate on the cds we were basis points at the end of december bottomed at basis points in april and ended june at basis points so still at a very low rate but its definitely kind of bottomed and started to move up a little bit just given the commercial and municipal side of the house with some pricing adjustments that weve made there and then i guess the last piece i would comment is just the new loans made during the second quarter and those came out at ph for the second quarter that was ph so thats a nice move up and its also about the portfolio rate so kind of some of the other drivers i would comment on brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay no thats helpful and maybe just last one just on the on the fee income side of the house maybe just can you talk about just kind of where some of the greatest opportunities are here with the two acquisitions and then maybe just kind of the mortgage outlook i mean i guess when you look at kind of this quarters level is this kind of a floor where that level is sustainable given kind of the trends youre seeing you talked about the refinance activity and just the origination activity vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say on the mortgage side i guess a couple of comments yeah were down a million from the first quarter the msr valuation recovery down by million so the kind of underlying number was up million but the absolute level obviously affected just by ph bankstated mortgages and rates having moved up so much as you look into the next couple quarters i mean our guidance has that ph 6ish number coming down to the number that more as a fourhandle to it just given kind of the expected activity within the year thats all thats all baked into our guidance brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania as far as the overall income category so i mean capital markets we those are our biggest opportunity i would say vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania absolutely we have some great wins coming in capital markets so particularly the debt capital markets platform that weve created to help us offset the slowing and weve got a fairly granular set of businesses that provides the income for the company i mean international banking has been doing pretty well there are some stuff in the pipeline for them capital markets as i mentioned is doing well syndications derivatives while derivative we thought which was lower i think clients are trying to hedge the future interest rate risk so when that came in a little better than we expected and i would expect there to be activity throughout the rest of the year in the interest rate derivatives category and certainly management has done very well vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the management has been really building that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah interchange actually moved up if you look at the service fees most of the service fee growth not its not overdraft its not those traditional categories its interchange fees for us growing coming back i guess indiscernible levels brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah and i was going to add vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah i was just going to add to thatyeah go ahead vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania go ahead im sorry brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah i was just going to say was that number a sustainable number given the interchange and kind of the breakdown you just gave on the treasury management and the interchange really kind of driving that growth this level should be a sustainable level as you just kind of go forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah those are pretty consistent reoccurring revenue stream brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania particularly the tm business i mean as we grow that business and continue to win business there its additive and its an annuity so brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc the interchange component is seasonal vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the interchange will be seasonal but the other pieces theyre either not right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the other thing i would comment on too brian is just looking in our slide i mean the wealth management side of it costtoincome this quarter has impacts just on market valuations on assets under management but underneath we have record organic sales activity occurring in the trust business and thats there and it will continue to build and help us get into later in the year and to next year so thats another area where weve been having some really good success brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay i appreciate all the help guys thanks for taking the question vincent j delie jr a
