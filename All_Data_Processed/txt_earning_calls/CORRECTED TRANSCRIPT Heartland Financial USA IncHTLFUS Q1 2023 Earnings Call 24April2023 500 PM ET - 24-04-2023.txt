million and continued stable clean credit heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 performance included in this quarters results were three notable items first million of losses on the sale of write down of assets which were primarily facilities related second charter consolidation restructure costs of million and third security losses of million together these items decreased pretax income by more than million and earnings per share by before i go into more detail i want to remind everyone that our first quarter earnings release and investor presentations are both available in the ir section of our htlf website ill start my comments with the provision for credit losses which totaled million or less than last quarter this quarter the provision reflects our continued stable healthy credit performance and consistent with last quarter incorporates an economic outlook that anticipates a moderate recession developing over the next months the provision also benefited from million of net loan recoveries in addition as bruce mentioned our delinquencies ticked up just slightly but remain very low at basis points of loans and nonperforming loans were flat compared to last quarter at quarter end the allowance for lending related credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments increased million to million or of total loans compared to last quarter moving to the balance sheet bruce already covered loans and deposits so ill start with investments investments remain flat at billion representing of assets with a tax equivalent yield of and will generate cash flows exceeding billion over the next months with approximately million next quarter the fair value mark on the available for sale securities portfolio continued to improve to a negative million thats a million or improvement over last quarter the relatively small held to maturity portfolio of million or of investments has an unrecorded negative fair value mark of million which is an improvement from million last quarter we continued to actively manage the portfolio by taking several actions during the quarter first we utilized nearly million of cash flow this quarter to fund loans and pay down borrowings and second we increased security pledging at the fed by billion leaving billion sic billion or of our available for sale securities unpledged at quarter end and lastly we repositioned our hedges to provide protection for unrealized security losses against the impact of higher mid to longterm rates moving to borrowings total borrowings declined million to million or of total assets the reduction was primarily in fed and fhlb borrowings which were reduced to just under million outstanding at quarter end our available and unused fed and fhlb borrowing capacity at quarter end stood at billion thats a billion increase over last quarter the increase is the result of paying down existing borrowings and pledging additional securities to the fed to summarize our liquidity profile at quarter end first we have billion of cash flow coming off our securities portfolio over the next months with million next quarter second we have a low level of outstanding borrowings and billion of available capacity with the fed and fhlb third we continue to have several fed fund borrowing lines and brokered deposits sources that remain open and available fourth our deposit base as bruce mentioned is granular and welldiversified with over of balances either insured or collateralized fifth our loan to deposit ratio is and when removing our wholesale deposits it remains low at sixth we have cash and unpledged available for sale securities totaling over billion and lastly the holding company cash position of million is times our current annualized interest and dividend payments in addition our dividend payout rate is relatively low at of current earnings per share heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 with regards to capital regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier at just over and total risk based of nearly adjusted for unrealized losses on our investments the ratio remained the ratios remain above wellcapitalized levels at approximately and respectively the tangible common equity ratio increased basis points to at quarter end the rise in market value of investments this quarter contributed basis points of the increase moving to the income statement starting with revenue net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million lower than the prior quarter and the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis fell basis points this quarter to the main drivers of the decreases were two fewer days in the quarter compared to last quarter resulting in million of the decrease a decline of million in fees and purchase accounting accretion which also reduced net interest margin by basis points a shift in deposit balances from lower costing nonmaturity deposits to much higher cost in time deposits primarily brokerage cds reduced net income by nearly million and decreased nim by basis points higher deposit betas than loan betas reflecting the significant increase in deposit competition that began in late accounts for the remaining decrease in net interest income and net interest margin and finally we exited the quarter with a adjusted nim of running at noninterest income of million this quarter was unchanged from the prior quarter excluding security losses in core noninterest income excluding security losses core noninterest income was million which exceeded our expectation of million to million shifting to expenses noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter thats down million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses the run rate of recurring operating expenses decreased million to million coming in slightly lower than our forecast of million to million looking ahead to the rest of htlf expects to see loan growth of million to million or per quarter and customer deposit growth of million or per quarter achieving these loan and deposit growth expectations should enable the bulk of the investment cash flow to be available to decrease wholesale deposits net interest income for q2 is expected to increase modestly over the first quarter and the net interest margin is expected to stabilize near the march run rate in the ph mid on a tax equivalent basis provision for credit losses are projected to range from million to million per quarter obviously declines in economic conditions or projections could impact future provisions if a worse than moderate recession develops where credit quality metrics began to decline core noninterest income excluding investment gains or losses is expected to be million to million next quarter recurring operating expenses are expected to be in the million to million range next quarter charter consolidation restructuring costs are forecasted to be million to million next quarter in addition we expect the total remaining cost to complete the project to approach million over the next three quarters and finally we believe a tax rate of excluding new tax credits is a reasonable run rate and with that ill turn the call over to bruce for questionandanswer sessions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc tawanda we can now open up the line for questions heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct our questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of damon delmonte with kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybodys doing well and thanks for taking my questions i just want to start off on the margin and the outlook for the margin maybe bryan you could give a little perspective on kind of where you see your full cycle beta is going to i think based on the jump this quarter youre kind of at about kind of cycle to date beta where do you kind of see that shaking out over the remainder of this year bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think youre looking at probably youre excluding dda when you that right damon when everybody indiscernible damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc a little bit yes yes thats pretty close to what ive got calculated for that same piece we tend to look at it with dda in but i think youre in the ballpark for cycle our normal cycle betas are around to on just the non dda component so i think they could move up just a little bit although it feels like theyre topping out it feels like unless rates start to go back up the fed moves and some things happen it feels like were in a fairly decent spot right now that things should sort of hold where they are but thats how it feels today damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and when you talk about the expected deposit growth in the coming quarters this is generally going to be driven from the wholesale side or is this from the retail side bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc no my comments damon were strictly it excluded any wholesale growth it was all consumer small business or commercial damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc new or existing customers damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then what are you able to quantify the impact of the sale of the benefit administration in record keeping business from a on a fee income side bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah so what i would say damon is thatll close here in q2 i would say well see a moderate gain not huge for us it moves around theres an earn out theres some things so i dont have an exact number to share with everybody but itll be modest and then what we see going forward is that the fees will go down a little bit but also our expenses go down so that should be on a run rate basis fairly close to an offset so i mean we didnt do this for an economic reason we did this for the benefit of our customers to provide them a better platform both our sponsors and the participants better technology and theres also some additional products that we can sell on this platform that we didnt have on our current platform damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then i guess lastly on the loan growth outlook do you expect a kind of a pickup in the ag portfolio i know bruce you commented that lower line utilization and kind of delayed need of funds because of the weather do you expect that to kind of ramp back up here in the second quarter bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah we absolutely do it was just really timing we saw significant increase in the fourth quarter we knew we would have decrease we didnt think it would be quite as significant as it was at million because theyre about three weeks behind we were just out in california two weeks ago in the planting season there because of some of the flooding about three weeks behind so yeah we expect that to come back damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats all that i have for now thanks operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks and good afternoon bruce just wanted to get back to your appreciate the customer deposit growth so is the use of wholesale deposits going to kind of swing with how successful you are on the customer growth or do you intend to kind of stop first all that growth or shrink how do you approach the wholesale deposit side heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah great question jeff so in a perfect world well grow our deposit to million from customers loans will be million to million well utilize the cash flow off our investment portfolio to fund that stub piece on the loan side and then wed use the rest of that cash flow to pay down wholesale funding jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it okay fair enough and then just jumping over to the looking at slide your whatever trying to get the sense of your optimized overhead ratio whatever youre sort of depicting it just over is that approaching the trough i just want to kind of check in with as we finished the charter consolidation and its taking a little more form yeah what is that kind of near term and maybe as we exit the year kind of the target and maybe theres moving pieces there but just trying to get a orientation for how far are we on is there in other words is there a sort of a trough optimization where you get to bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think this is bryan i think that that you see on page i think wed love to see that get down to or below as we kind of get through a charter consolidation weve done some other things as you noted to improve efficiency i think the if i if you take kind of where when we started the charter consolidation we were running at that maybe about and million on billion is basis points so we should get at least to the were at and better with all the other things including charter consolidation that weve been working on jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc makes sense jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah yeah i follow you yes i appreciate it and just sort of a followup on the i just wanted to make sure so the guide bryan on the operating expense and fee income thats inclusive of the rps sale or we get you havent totally quantified that and as you said therell be when there is adjustment itll be offset were just trying to see if thats baked into the guide bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think we can again the two net off of each other so if i didnt get all of it out of the noninterest income i probably didnt get it all out of the noninterest expense so the two will kind of have about the same number if i missed that in my guidance i would say i probably didnt have that all because it wont be for a full quarter and everything so as we go forward and get that true run rate i can refine that for you heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it but close enough it sounds like its bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think so jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co again okay all right well thank you bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks jeff operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions maybe just start on deposits could you maybe talk about deposit activity across your footprint particularly in march and im just curious if you have any comments on california and maybe if there was outsized consumer deposit openings in that specific state and market bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah terry when we think about our entire footprint all of our markets we did see in our more urban markets higher kind of higher runoff of deposits the rest of the footprint was much less and in california we actually grew balances during the quarter and it was primarily because on the consumer side terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that and then maybe bryan a question for you could you just talk about kind of the aoci kind of burned down over the next couple of years just as we think about building out kind of tangible capital and book value im just im curious on that topic what was the cost and process to kind of hedge higher rates and the value of the securities portfolio that you mentioned in your prepared remarks bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah ill see if i can i probably dont have all of that here at the top of my head or in my notes but if rates kind of hang where they are or what we were protecting with in the hedge was for middleterm rates which is where our investment securities are kind of tied to from a duration standpoint so we were able to put this hedge on to actually reduce the duration effect on that portfolio by i think ph in fact to only close to a year so we think that protects on our worst side which is those rates go up right and then we have deterioration in our tce heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 ratio because of that aoci so that was the reason for putting the hedge on i think if rates and we can just roll out and the cash flow comes out it will improve terry i dont have the exact burn down exactly but in terms of how the gain or loss will come out but i think where we saw the you wont see quite that unless rates come down but youll see that roll off and that number should get better does that makes sense indiscernible terry mcevoy a analyst stephens inc thanks bryan and then yes bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah we dont have anything better than indiscernible terry mcevoy a analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that and then i think nathan was on the call a question for him i mean were all kind of focused on office cre and the exposure there from your perspective is that where we should be focused as outsiders looking into the bank and maybe one other parts of that kind of nonowner occupied cre portfolio are you monitoring a bit more closely nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah absolutely terry yeah i think office is the one that has everybody heightened we certainly do a lot of research analysis on ourselves constantly looking at it we feel pretty good about it we really dont have much of construction there and have a pretty low percentage overall from a concentration and of course its strongly underwritten and it so far has performed well and a lot of the stuff that were seeing today from a market perspective was accounted for in a lot of our underwriting as we kind of stress and plan for potential refinance risk so we feel like its in a good position but expanding that question is kind of where you ask but what are other things are we looking at and kind of really paying focus on were really trying to get our hands around and also understand kind of where retail and hospitality or two others that we keep a high focus on and then also if theres any possible ph contagion into other areas like a medical office space so far we continue to watch and really keep ahead of just talking with our customers getting out there make sure we understand where theyre at and trying to understand where the potential ph contagion could go terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch with piper sandler your line is open heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone just to go back to deposits and just like obviously the trends here in the quarter recommend as a expecting some growth here should the mix of growth be the mix the trend be similar to what we saw in the last quarter with demand accounts down and cds up and then i guess what are you guys expecting on the other interest bearing accounts bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i think well see demand up a little bit because of the new relationships that we that are in our pipeline on the commercial side i think on the consumer side it will probably skew a little more toward interest bearing accounts andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc indiscernible there was a fair amount of seasonality in the first quarter in commercial demand accounts as we normally have between and andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co right bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and so we do expect some of that to build back up andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you all right and then so the consumer campaigns i suspect that was largely in cds how many are these campaigns still ongoing and is that where you expect most of the and i guess how long do you expect to run these campaigns or is this going to be a new part of the funding going forward bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc were going to continue to run the campaigns through the second quarter and i think we may not be running a campaign but we will definitely keep our advertising spend higher than it has been historically because its been so successful andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and its both andrew it is both aimed at transaction accounts as well as cds and we have both andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc were looking at those andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you youve covered all my other questions ill step back thanks operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask you about noninterest bearing deposits and htlf has run anywhere from to noninterest bearing to total deposits for the last several years and the events of the last several weeks i think are causing both businesses and consumers to review their deposit accounts and theres definitely a trend moving towards interest bearing accounts and look weve been in a zero rate environment for the last years on and off or at least most of the time absent a couple of years can the noninterest bearing for htlf drop as far as or of your concentration of deposits bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc david great question and i guess the short answer is i dont think so and let me give you some of the details about the commercial deposit decline for the quarter because as i mentioned earlier we normally have to seasonal declines and weve looked at all the movement in the first quarter and approximately of the decrease on the commercial side and most of this came out of the ddas were just business operations normal business activity another were tax distributions or indiscernible distributions and then if you lumped people taking money out for alternative investments going somewhere for higher interest rates or safety concerns that would be about with safety concerns being the smallest piece there was only of the deposit movement so when i say that thats why i dont believe that we can get as low as youre referencing and our core activity is to generate new relationships and weve been able to do it now for i think seven quarters in a row on the commercial side and all the deposits come with it so i feel pretty good it may go down into the really low but i dont see it getting into the low heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2023 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it thank you bruce appreciate that color thats all i have thanks operator thank you i saw no further questions in the queue i would now like to turn the call back over to mr lee for closing remarks bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland
