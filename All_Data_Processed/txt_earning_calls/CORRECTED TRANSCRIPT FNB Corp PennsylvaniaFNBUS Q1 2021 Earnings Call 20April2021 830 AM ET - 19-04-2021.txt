officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone we continued to see positive performance across our credit portfolio during the first quarter of the year our key credit metrics improved across the board and remain at very solid levels with betterthanexpected results across a number of consumer portfolios as well as the favorable positioning of our commercial book following the actions taken last quarter to proactively reduce exposure to the most challenged industries i would now like to review some highlights for the quarter followed by a brief overview of our current deferral levels the level of delinquency improved over the prior quarter to end march at basis points representing a basis point improvement linkedquarter which was driven by positive macroeconomic trends and some seasonally lower past due levels in the consumer portfolio as is typical in the first quarter excluding ppp loan volume delinquency stands at basis points the level of npls and oreo ended march at basis points an improvement of bps on a linkedquarter basis while the nongaap level excluding ppp loans stands at basis points the improvement was largely driven by a reduction in nonaccrual loans of million during the quarter with nearly half of our npls continuing to pay on a contractually current basis net chargeoffs for the first quarter came in at a very solid level of million or basis points annualized and bps on a nongaap basis with provision expense totaling million resulting in an ending march reserve position at excluding the ppp portfolio the nongaap acl stands at up basis point over the prior quarter inclusive of the remaining acquired unamortized discount our total reserve coverage stands at with our npl coverage position also remaining favorable at following the previously noted improvement in npl levels during the quarter id now like to provide you with a brief update on our loan deferral levels at the end of march our deferrals are down to of our core loan portfolio and the number of new requests from commercial borrowers have essentially ceased at this point we continue to monitor these smaller credits actively as we have done throughout the entire pandemic with the expectation that the numbers will continue to reduce as the economy opens up fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 additionally we continue to track our portfolio mix and performance trends to stay ahead of any potentially sensitive asset classes that could show signs of stress towards the tail end of the pandemic as is consistent with our approach to risk management we will continue to proactively identify any potential areas of risk and take action if opportunities arise that are strategically and financially beneficial to the company in closing we are very pleased with the solid start to the year and the continued progress weve made in the book to work down our limited exposure to the more sensitive industries as the broader economy continues to evolve we are focused on managing our book through our core credit principles of disciplined underwriting across our footprint attentive risk management and the proactive workout of credits to keep our portfolio wellpositioned as we look forward to the anticipated activity from an accelerating economy in the second half of the year i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will discuss our financial results and some of our current expectations as noted on slide first quarter eps was solid at up significantly on a yearoveryear basis as the first quarter of has significant reserve build at the onset of the pandemic at a high level results for the quarter included record levels of noninterest income translating into revenue growth well managed expenses and significantly lower provision for loan losses given recent asset quality trends partially offset by the continued impact of this low interest rate environment lets review the balance sheet on page average balances for total loans increased on a year over year basis and decreased in the fourth quarter on a spot basis for the first quarter of total loans were up as ppp balances increased million on a net basis with million of round two ppp loans funded during the quarter partially offset by million of ppp forgiveness commercial line utilization rates remain at record lows in the low which translates into about a 05billion in funded balances at a normalized utilization rate this level creates upside for loan growth as reflected in the strength of our long range commercial pipelines which are near alltime highs turning to deposits average deposits grew on a yearoveryear basis and increased annualized on a linkedquarter basis on a spot basis for the first quarter of total deposits increased billion or annualized led by strong growth in noninterestbearing and interestbearing demand deposits partially offset by a managed decrease in time deposits this continued deposit growth bolsters our ample liquidity and strengthens our deposit mix with a loan to deposit ratio at with of our deposits being noninterestbearing at the end of the quarter turning to the income statement net interest income declined million or compared to the fourth quarter the reported net interest margin narrowed basis points to as higher average cash balances were 6basis point negative impact on the margin compared to last quarter additional drivers to the lower margin were a 7basis point reduction in ppp contribution and a 2basis point reduction in the benefit from purchase accounting on acquired loans excluding these impacts the underlying margin increased basis points from the fourth quarter with benefits from continuing to manage down interestbearing deposit costs which improved basis points to basis points for fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 the quarter with the cost of these deposits ending the quarter at basis points on a spot basis basis points lower than the average we expect further reductions in our cost of funds moving forward lets now look at noninterest income and expense on slides and noninterest income totaled a record million as mortgage banking income remained strong at million with expanded gain on sale margins and strong sold production volume that was up on a yearoveryear basis wealth management increased in the fourth quarter to record levels due to the expanded footprint and positive market impacts on assets under management solid contributions from capital markets and insurance also supported the record fee income result for the quarter looking at slide noninterest expense totaled million relatively flat with the prior quarter and year ago quarter on an operating basis compared to the fourth quarter of salaries and employee benefits increased million or primarily related to million of expense in the first quarter of due to the timing of normal seasonal longterm compensation recognition similar to last years first quarter occupancy and equipment on an operating basis increased million or due to investments in digital technology expansion in key growth markets across the footprint and seasonal expenses related to adverse weather our cet1 ratio improved to an estimated up from last march even with million of buyback over this period reflecting fnbs strategy to optimize capital deployment turning to our outlook we expect reported net interest income to be generally flat from first quarter levels as we expect a pickup in loan activity to be weighted toward the second half of the year and the net interest income contribution from ppp to be similar to the first quarter for the full year of our midsingle digit loan and transaction deposit growth assumptions exppp remain unchanged from our prior guidance we expect continued strong contributions in mortgage banking given the pipelines vince mentioned with total noninterest income expected in the high 70million range for the second quarter for provision our current outlook is down from our expectations in january subject to loan origination activity in the second half of the year we are on track to achieve our expense savings target of million for and expect operating expenses for the second quarter to be down from seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter based on our current forecasted level of mortgage commissions for the full year of we still expect revenues to be stable compared to and expenses to be down slightly yearoveryear lastly we expect the full year effective tax rate to be around assuming no change to the statutory corporate tax rate of i will now turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince weve covered a lot of ground

operator question and answer section operator yes thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster and this mornings first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 in terms of the excess liquidity in the books i wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you manage that in the near term are you starting to see enough of these deposits sticking around more than transitory where you can start redirecting into the securities book for some yield or is there enough loan growth potential that you seek to keep that things to keep that powder dry vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say during the quarter it fell quite a bit as we put in the comments there ending the quarter around billion i think as we look ahead and as we commented on we do expect loan activity to pick up in the second half of the year we do have billion of federal home loan bank advances that are maturing this year thatll use some of the cash we have started to reinvest the cash flows from the securities portfolio we actually grew it a little bit if you exclude the tbills that we had in there million at the end of the year so were reinvesting the cash flows there now that the rates are at least north of up about basis points from where they were earlier in the quarter so as far as the securities portfolio kind of around that same dollar level as we ended the quarter is kind of the current expectation so really a combination of the maturing advances and then the loan activity picking up and using up some of that cash we dont want to go along and really well up the investment portfolio we dont think that that makes sense the cash flow from that portfolio was pretty significant over the next months theres billion thats going to kind of cash flow over the next months so depending on where rates go we will be opportunistic if rates the year rate moves significantly during the quarter if theres opportunity and we see things we like we would invest more than the cash flows but theres a good opportunity to continue to remit that portfolio as we go forward in here frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just secondly lastly im just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your updated thoughts on ma weve seen a lot of it so far in the industry in you guys talked about the strong pipeline it sounds like theres plenty of organic opportunity but just wondering how ma could fit into the strategy and what thats what a deal could look like vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah well i think as i mentioned in my prepared comments we are very wellpositioned unlike some other banks and midsized groups were spread across a fairly broad geography were in a number of high growth markets weve had very good success with our de novo expansion strategy particularly in charleston and now were starting to see some good progress in washington dc obviously as we move forward ma at some point is inevitable one way or another but i feel pretty strongly about where we are from a performance perspective i think that weve posted some very solid orders weve got some very good measured growth weve got very solid pipelines going into the second half of the year weve said repeatedly that we felt that well see a surge in demand towards the second half of the year its starting to play out in the pipelines that we have in the event that an opportunity were to present itself from an acquisition perspective obviously weve been very disciplined in the past and weve done a very good job of executing theres a large group of people here that fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 have tremendous amount of experience with integration and performing due diligence but our first focus is to try to drive organic growth through the platform that weve created both digitally and in those high growth markets that weve expanded into we think theres substantial upside for the shareholders as we execute our longerterm strategic plan thats one two is were obviously looking at opportunities to deploy capital and i think as we continue to grow and i think one good example is i am shifting gears here a little bit but one good example is actually our incentive compensation plan the ltip awards themselves align our interests with the shareholders where we grow tangible book value per share and continue to pay an attractive dividend so internal capital growth is an important factor and return on tangible common equity as we grow our capital base performing at a higher level by taking cost out and driving returns up is also part of our short and longterm incentive plan so i know thats a really long answer but obviously were capable of doing acquisition its still not a principal focus of ours and if something comes along thats attractive that works in market theres a high probability that we would look at it but its not a focus of ours at this point frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thanks guys vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning jared fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe shifting over to the expenses you made good progress like you said on reaching your targeted expense cuts are there other additional expense opportunities that you could shift to or is it really at this point more an efficiency story as revenue comes back that that would be the primary driver of lower efficiency ratio now vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah just a couple of comments on the expenses during the first quarter we mentioned the seasonality in total theres about million of seasonality in the cost base that happens in the first quarter the stock compensation that we talked about was million payroll taxes are million and when you restart the year utilities were up million so really theres kind of million that isnt recurring so kind of where we go from here we have indiscernible cost save which is baked into our guidance for the third year in a row and as you noticed were still guiding expenses being down for the full year slightly from level of million and as you look ahead to the next quarter i mean the expenses will come down in the several million dollar area from first quarter to second quarter from those seasonally elevated levels and then as far as how we kind of execute on the cost savings i mean this is year three of it so theres always been a focus in the company on disciplined management of costs the things that weve had kind of in our tool belt continue to be in the tool belt as far as continued optimization of the retail bank closely monitoring customer preferences as they evolve renegotiating contracts is constant weve dusted off our top vendors going back through all of those including the large ones were starting to have some success as far as optimizing our space throughout the footprint not just branches but also some of our kind of operating facilities and then kind of rpa is a topic its robotic process automation we have a bunch of initiatives that were looking at and that will be a big focus for us in and thats kind of a newer item so thats kind of additive to the things weve been focusing on as part of the kind of cost savings initiatives over the last couple of years jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks thats good color maybe shifting over to the allowance with the improving economic backdrop how quickly can we see that allowance ratio start to migrate back maybe towards the day one level either through a combination of the provision or growth is that something we should expect to see maybe lower dependence on qualitative overlays as you go through the next few quarters gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared when you look at day one cecl at right around round figures million and reserve level in the high1 versus today at in terms of the position of it and about million we do expect that theres opportunity there as we move through the cycle and we see upgrades and reductions in criticized assets that were impacted by the pandemic we did move the forecast in q4 to a consensus forecast so we did see a little bit of benefit there we do expect to see a little bit of benefit going forward from modelrelated benefits as well as i mentioned upgrades from the criticized portfolio we were down million in criticized assets this quarter and we do expect that to continue fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 as we move forward the modelrelated benefits we expect of that delta are about or so and from a credit standpoint about so we do see some benefit coming as we are seeing improved performance in a number of those credits a final comment around it from a model framework standpoint the qualitative piece of it varies from low to about right now were sitting near the high end of that so i would not expect that qualitative to go up any from where its at or very slightly so there is some benefit in that piece of it as well jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just finally for me you commented on the ci pipelines being so strong geographically is that really just focused more on the carolinas or are you seeing any type of significant trends in your legacy markets and when youre talking about that is that primarily new customers and new customers of the bank or do you think that you get back to that normal utilization level maybe in third quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say a couple of things first of all it does not necessarily contemplate getting back to normal utilization rates in the second half of the year i mean i think theres still a lot of liquidity out there theres a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines for our corporate clients its going to take a while to deploy that capital so thats one aspect of it having said that in our legacy markets as we sit today weve gotten better production out of the southeast much better the midwest and the northeast has been a little slower based on the pipelines that weve had what weve actually funded in production in the first quarter in the second half of the year there are a number of opportunities that are coming that are larger in the upper middle market to call it large corporate space that are kind of ma related so weve got a number of opportunities within our legacy markets that should drive some growth for us both in capital markets piece and with the size of the commercial portfolio so thats pittsburgh cleveland baltimore markets and then in the carolinas theres still quite a bit of activity across the board so were pretty optimistic about that the pipelines have grown considerably so if you recall last quarter we said things were a little light from because we had a big quarter closings in the fourth quarter but that has rebuilt and actually exceeds where it was at the high last year so were more optimistic about achieving the guidance that we put out there and growing in the second half of the year i hope that helps that and its really a combination of both existing customers and new opportunities that were seeing jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats a gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania weve seen fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we have weve seen a lot of activity across the board but its really increasing in the carolinas with some of the bankers that weve brought on over the last four to six months new leadership in one area there in charlotte whos really generating some nice new name opportunities high quality credit and some good opportunities that weve already worked through and in the pipeline so were excited about that vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania when i think about the quarter jared i mean really i think it was a solid quarter even though we didnt show the loan growth for this quarter i think theres prospects for loan growth fairly substantial down the road theres a lot of activity going on i feel better about our balance sheet than i ever have because of our cet1 capital ratio at the amount of liquidity that we have weve got many options to deploy that liquidity that will enhance earnings were now able to buy shares back which we couldnt do historically so as i look at the quarter without substantial reserve release we did pretty well this quarter and its a good foundation to build on as we move throughout the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great thanks appreciate the color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks jared gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks jared operator thank you and your next question comes from michael young with truist securities michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning thanks for the question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey michael fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning michael michael young q analyst truist securities inc wanted to start maybe just with the revenue guidance obviously the second round of ppp have a little more color on now but i noticed the revenue guide wasnt adjusted upwards so are other things offsetting it or is that just putting too fine of a point on the guidance overall vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so actually we did revise the guidance michael from where it was in january given round two of ppp so we had moved the revenue originally im trying to remember it was down slightly with the guide in january we moved it up to stable from full year given the round two contribution and its come in pretty strong i mean as i mentioned we said billion were up billion as we sit here today so we did move the guidance up to reflect that michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks and i guess a followup question just on the margin kind of outlook i know theres a lot of moving pieces but if we look at maybe nii dollars should we kind of think about it having bottomed here just on a core basis exppp and purchase accounting accretion with the potential to continue to kind of steadily climb as liquidity is deployed and loan growth returns vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the guidance as you can see on the slide there is for net interest income to be flat from the fourth quarter coming into the first quarter you did have the impact on the ppp contribution was reduced from where it was in the fourth quarter so that kind of ran against the overall decline million so we expect that to be at a comparable level in the second quarter to where it was in the first so you wont have kind of a drag on the ppp the cash side of it it doesnt affect dollars it doesnt affect the margin so kind of given where we ended the quarter theres an additional drag and its good to i dont know if you noticed slide is a new slide weve put in there of kind of a deep composition of net interest income and margin there as we see it i think the ppp and pcd contribution increasing on the prior loans we would expect to be kind of comparable levels in that second quarter like i mentioned the cash contribution getting a little bit worse from a margin perspective but not really from a dollar perspective so the dollar is kind of being flat just based on those and then you have other things i mean in the first quarter we had one less day that affects us lag working down basis points that was million one less day is million so first quarter had quite a few things affecting it that kind of become a help as you move forward from here so i would expect that the dollars flat to up as we move forward as you get into the second half of the year i think one of the things thats really important is that the ppp contribution i mean i really look at that as a bridge to the loan activity and kind of increasing so the contribution has been coming in kind of each quarter with million in the fourth quarter million this quarter we look for a similar number in the second quarter down a little bit in the third quarter but it really fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 serves as a nice bridge for this commercial loan activity to the traditional commercial loan activity picking up in the second half of the year so kind of a long answer there michael but yeah i think i would agree with your statement but i just wanted to kind of talk through the moving parts there michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and maybe just one last one just on the share buyback the million remaining its good to see activity again on it this quarter can you just talk about kind of appetite going forward given where the stock price is today and any other thoughts there vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean well be opportunistic its we look at capital allocation every day and decide what should we do with our capital and its been said now that you have a cet at you have some opportunities to kind of optimize that capital base depending on what happens in the balance sheet so if the loan growth kind of ramps up in the second half of the year we will be less active if it doesnt come through quite as strong well continue to be more active there with our repurchasing the million is left we just kind of have to see how the balance sheet movements kind of transpire from here but were definitely we still think the stock valuation is very attractive so weve been very active weve bought a good amount the million in the first quarter and well continue to do the right thing as far as shareholder interest and were all aligned on those so well continue to manage it appropriately michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah operator thank you and the next question comes from russell gunther with da davidson russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co just one quick followup while were on capital return so vince your comments on the inevitability of ultimately returning to ma down the road could you just provide a little bit of color in terms of where you would like to go or fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 fill in from an asset size perspective geographic perspective just any additional thoughts would be great thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think that obviously inmarket transactions would be the most appealing as ive said though weve always been fairly discipline our incentive compensation plans are designed for us to grow tangible book value so were not looking to do a large dilutive transaction i can tell you that i think that were open to it well look at it but again i dont want to get specific because thats not the principal focus we think we have a great model business model that were executing on i mentioned in my quote in the release that weve done in the release that weve done more than applications digitally so we just launched our whole digital platform in january unfortunately it was right before or fortunately i should say it was right before the pandemic so we were able to accommodate customers but we really didnt have a great opportunity to promote it like we would have liked we had to shift gears and focus more on ppp origination which we did digitally and thats all coming online this year so well have a great opportunity to grow organically through that platform as well and thats only starting so as we integrate our ability to take applications in the consumer segment were enhancing that were going to be able to take loan applications in mortgage and consumer loans home equity on that platform and then later in the year small business loans so that will significantly change our ability to efficiently go after market share and the focus will shift a little bit strategically from a marketing perspective but i weve got all of that going on so i dont rule out ma because i think that its an important part of our dna but again i have quite a few things going on that are pretty positive and it certainly isnt something that we feel desperate to do russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i appreciate your thoughts there and guys the rest of my questions were asked and answered thank you very much vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you so much vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 hey good morning guys this is elan zanger on for casey vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey elan how you doing elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc so just looking at the core loan yields exppp there was still some compression could you maybe talk a little bit about kind of the outlook there where are you seeing spread compression and whats the new money loan yield thats coming on balance sheet gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah in terms of spreads they had moved up when you go back during the soft period i can tell you they have moved down again theyre ranging depending upon the credit quality from for extremely solid credit to depending upon the transaction the tenor and the quality of that asset the real estate opportunities that were seeing are generally in the to bps range some very strong transactions with extreme amounts of equity type of equity maybe slightly under that but that gives you a pretty good range vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and i would just add as far as the new loans made during the quarter if you put the ppp on the side we were at rate for the new loans kind of from a coupon standpoint it was in the fourth quarter so kind of ex ppp ppp with a coupon brings that number down to so thats kind of running through the average balance sheet that youd see there but the versus the is kind of an applestoapples number so some stability there which is good elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc okay and then back on the securities reinvestment rates i understand its more just cash flow coming off but thats going back in where is that today relative to the basis points that you showed in the first quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well the reinvestment rates as we looked at what happened during the quarter it moved significantly i mean in january basis points is what was available by march we had basis points that we were reinvesting at so thats kind of a good proxy to use for where were putting money to work but again the stuff thats rolling off is rolling off kind of in the basis points so theres still basis points difference there theres still some of that continue to roll through and have that gap narrow but that gives you the kind of the figure as far as where were reinvesting today were not going long so were not going to make bets here and lock stuff up for many years i mean weve kept the duration on the shorter side so that we will real benefit when rates move again someday and we definitely during the quarter we kind of backend loaded the reinvestment we were definitely less active much less active in january basis points and more active in march like i said earlier well be opportunistic when we see securities and yields that we like well reinvest fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc okay okay so the low ones right now okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc okay great thats all for me thanks guys vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from samuel varga with stephens inc samuel varga q analyst stephens inc good morning im on for brody vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning samuel varga q analyst stephens inc i just wanted to ask a couple questions on the loan portfolio and kind of going off of the previous question looking at what percentage of loans are in floating rates so where can we expect kind of a backstop to some of the loan compression vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania that number has moved up i want to say were probably around or so of the portfolio it sounds for us i mean theres been as weve been going through this recent cycle theres been an active process to put those in place so it benefits us next time vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania but recently the originations havent included floors the competitive environment has essentially negated the ability to get floors i dont know gary if you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania were getting floors and fewer transactions today again i go back six to nine months when we were very successful in getting floors into the transactions we made good progress during that timeframe it is getting much more competitive getting back to the interest rate spread commentary as well and its more difficult today than it has been and it is reducing pretty significantly at this point vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats going to vary based upon the risk profile of the borrower so if its a riskier situation the borrower is going to agree to a floor if its a higher quality credit the borrower is not going to agree to a floor and youre not going to be able to impose a floor on them so we tend to compete just like everybody says we tend to go after higher quality credit opportunities so really thats a function of the competitive environment and we try our best but gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thats really where its at today samuel varga q analyst stephens inc i understand thank you and then another data point around that what percent of the loan portfolio has a floating rate contract so i understand 15s at the floor already but i guess what percentage of the floating rate for the total vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well total variable and adjustable combined is of the total loan portfolio and just to give the data points you typically give one month libor with which is billion and then theres another tied to prime of billion and thats embedded in that overall figure samuel varga q analyst stephens inc awesome thank you very much and then just one more question tied to this if we were to see a bps rate hike sometime this year what percent of those at the floor would start getting above the floor gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania a very very small percentage of that if any it would be very low most of the floors are in the basis points weve gotten many in at basis points very very few at basis points samuel varga q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you and that would be it for me thank you very much fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just wondered if you can comment on the i appreciate the color on the mortgage and the pipeline and just i know vince you talked last quarter about kind of the debt capital market piece and kind of getting into that in the second half but just kind of as you look high level i guess where the fee income is at today at this level it gets feels pretty sustainable if you have that pick up in the second half and service charges rebound i guess is are we thinking about fee income in that way looking at it the right way with that type of sustainability and growth from here as mortgage remains strong and the other fees kick in and service charges pick up a bit vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think your characterization is stable it is a very good characterization we have the value of it being as diversified as it is right helps because not everythings at a record every quarter but as we look forward from here particularly to the second quarter we would expect mortgage to be similarly strong number capital markets have been very strong even though its down from a lightsout record last year million to million is a very very strong quarter there so as we look at whats baked into our guidance brian were around that millionish figure per quarter so the stability comment is a good way to look at it with some upside with some of the newer initiatives that really are just starting so i think theres some upside thats not baked into the guidance yet because kind of the newness of it brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right okay perfect okay and then maybe just one or two others just on the forgiveness and the remaining fees that are going to be collected given that a lot of that round is just in there how much do you expect to fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 big picture to see realized of the million in versus maybe some bleeding over into is that more of it coming in is that your expectation with just a little i guess piece that may overhang into vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean the million thats there i mean million of it is related to round that portal hasnt been opened yet right so that needs to happen before you have the kind of the machine is cranking there so there i would say for the next couple of quarters will be fine as i mentioned earlier looking for a similar level in the second quarter third quarter kind of come down a few million from there i mean there are some tail that would go into but theres not a ton left that goes through there i am trying to think of and what do we have whats our to look ahead just for its far pretty small right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and most of it would be in brian just brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont have the full year in front of me i had the quarterly but brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect and just your comments about the pipeline i just need to make sure i understood that the southeast obviously is doing well i guess your comments on just remind me just on the pipelines in the northeast and in the midwest just how theyre looking today vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the second half of the year is much better for our legacy markets cleveland pittsburgh even baltimore baltimore had a great year last year finished really strong and then it was a little slower in the first quarter thats really the baltimoredc area they cover both i think the pipelines for those areas particularly in upper middle fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 market and large corporate is very solid for the second half of the year so were starting to see some sizable opportunities coming in it would generate both capital markets fees and fundings for us in the southeast their pipelines have been pretty strong and their production has been decent its on par with the first quarter of last year and continues to build so charlotte in particular is performing pretty well and theres quite a bit coming in and then even in some of the other business units that we have builder finance which is based in charlotte under this cre group small portfolio but were expecting them to do a little more this year were seeing a lot of activity gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats very active right now vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i mean there is quite a bit going on if you look at what i was trying to say and i probably didnt do a great job was funded production for us in the first quarter was more there were more solid contributions from the southeast than our legacy market when you look at the pipeline overall end to end for the rest of the year the next three quarters its a sizable theres been a sizable increase in the pipeline so that tells me that theres a lot more going on out there than we had initially thought thats what i was trying to communicate brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thank you thats helpful thats helpful and i appreciate thats all i have then thanks guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you brian vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian operator thank you and that does conclude the questionandanswer session i would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah again id like to thank everybody thank our employees in particular because theyve gone through a tremendous amount and weve had to forge
