seen this morning we had a solid fourth quarter and full year of amidst a challenging operating environment over the course of the year we grew loans and deposits delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position record levels of capital and liquidity and significant credit reserves in addition we grew tangible book value per share yearoveryear while the economy improved modestly this quarter and were encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines we continue to operate amidst the pandemic a low rate environment and weak loan demand and before rob walks you through the full details of our results i wanted to share a few high level observations first the investments weve made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this pandemic the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest while supporting our stakeholders and coming out stronger as a company in addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe we provided billions of dollars of credit to our clients we granted billion in loan modifications and registered more than loans worth approximately billion through the federal governments first round of the paycheck protection program and our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of ppp in response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism we committed billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among black americans in low and moderate income communities and as youre aware in the second quarter of we sold our passive stake passive equity stake in blackrock in november announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire bbva usa since that announcement we spent a lot of time with bbvas employees and have become even more excited about our combination given their talent in highgrowth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients manage risk and support our communities this transaction will create a leading national franchise significantly accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability and finally id like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a very challenging year and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at our results and then well take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc great thanks bill and good morning everyone as youve seen weve reported fourth quarter net income of billion or per diluted common share resulting in full year net income from continuing operations of billion or per diluted common share the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis during the quarter lower utilization and soft loan demand drove a billion or decline in loans and low rates pressured investment securities which declined billion or our cash balances at the federal reserve grew to billion in the fourth quarter our elevated liquidity position is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances on the liability side deposit balances averaged billion and were up billion or linked quarter borrowed funds decreased billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to reduce debt our tangible book value was per common share as of december an increase of linked quarter and yearoveryear and as of december our cet1 ratio was estimated to be in regard to capital return our board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of per share or million and consistent with the fed mandate we had no share repurchases during the fourth quarter our expectations for share repurchases in remains the same as we stated this past december that is well refrain from share repurchases excluding employee benefitrelated purchases during the period leading up to our pending bbva usa transaction close date expected to be midsummer following the close all else being equal and subject to ccar wed expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year slide shows our average loans and deposits in more detail average loan balances of billion in the fourth quarter were down billion or compared to the third quarter this decline included a billion decrease in commercial loan balances which was broad based reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending in our cib segment utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately below pre pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions evidenced by high levels of deposit consumer loans declined billion and balances were lower across all consumer categories compared to the same period a year ago total average loans grew or billion as the slide shows the yield on our loan balances is a basis point increase compared to the third quarter reflecting higher ppp loan forgiveness and a shift in consumer loan mix and we continue to reduce the rate paid on our interestbearing deposits to basis points a basis point decline linked quarter average deposit balances of billion increased billion or as a result of enhanced liquidity of our customers as well as seasonal growth yearoveryear deposits increased billion or with strong growth in both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits as a result our loantodeposit ratio has declined to a low of at the end of the fourth quarter compared to in the same period in as you can see on slide full year revenue was billion up slightly compared with driven by higher fee income expenses declined million or and remain well controlled our full year provision was billion compared with million in reflecting the economic effects of the pandemic our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the full year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide you can see our total revenue has grown consistently over the past several years driven by our broadbased business mix for the fourth quarter net interest income of billion was down million or from the third quarter primarily due to lower loan and security balances and lower securities yields full year net interest income of billion was down slightly by million yearoveryear as higher earning asset balances and lower rates paid on deposits were essentially offset by lower yields on earning assets the fourth quarter net interest margin of declined basis points linked quarter notably growth in fed cash balances represented a basis point decline which accounts for more than the total linked quarter decrease to net interest margin both full year and linked quarter net interest margin reflected the impact of substantially higher fed cash balances to size that impact fourth quarter fed balances averaged billion exceeding our lcr requirement by approximately billion this level of excess liquidity represented basis points of compression to our reported fourth quarter nim fourth quarter noninterest income declined million or compared with the third quarter fee income of billion increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by growth in corporate service fees of million or due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity partially offsetting this growth was a decline in residential mortgage noninterest income of million reflecting a negative rmsr valuation adjustment and lower servicing fees other noninterest income of million decreased million linked quarter the decline was primarily driven by a negative million visa derivative adjustment related to the extension of the expected timing of the litigation resolution importantly we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across the franchise and those efforts helped to drive record fee income of billion in an increase of million or compared to this growth was driven by higher corporate service fees primarily related to increased activity in our advisory businesses and treasury management as well as stronger residential mortgage noninterest income partially offsetting this growth was a decline in both consumer services and service charges on deposits due to impact of the pandemic particularly in the second quarter as well as our ongoing efforts to simplify products and reduce transaction fees for our customers other noninterest income declined million yearoveryear or reflecting lower private equity revenue and elevated gains on asset sales related to our asset management business partially offset by higher net securities gains turning to slide our full year noninterest expenses were billion a decline of million or compared with as we responded to the crises and we managed expenses down taking a look at the fourth quarter expenses grew by million or linked quarter primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense of million due to higher incentive compensation associated with increased business activity and in addition other expenses were up million due to seasonality and equipment impairments the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 importantly we generated positive operating leverage in and as a result our efficiency ratio for the full year was improving from last year while the current environment presents revenue challenges we remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management we had a goal of million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we successfully completed actions to achieve that goal looking forward to our annual cip goal will once again be million slide is an update regarding specific industries weve identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic our outstanding loan balances in the covid highimpact categories declined in the fourth quarter to billion as of december compared to billion at the end of the third quarter largely driven by commercial and industrial paydowns within the ci identified industries nonperforming loans remained relatively low representing less than of loans outstanding and chargeoffs have not been material that being said we do expect to see further stress in these industries the lower half of this slide presents the highly impacted commercial real estate and related loan categories these industries are experiencing the most pressure and downgrades continue to occur our two largest charge offs in the fourth quarter were related to loans in this category overall now for all of these covid highimpact loans we remain well reserved and continue to carefully monitor and manage these exposures moving to slide this is an update to our customer hardship relief we continue to see a reduction in the number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance and importantly loans under modification that present credit risk to pnc continue to decline at the end of the year we had million of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment assistance with credit risk to pnc down from billion at september on the commercial side were also continuing to selectively grant loan modification based on each individual borrowers situation within our cib segment less than million of loan balances were in deferral as of december when combining consumer and commercial customers loans receiving assistance and posing credit risk to pnc are approximately billion representing less than of total loans outstanding and as i previously mentioned are appropriately reserved our credit metrics are presented on slide total delinquencies of billion at december increased million or consumer loan delinquencies increased million primarily due to governmentinsured mortgages that recently exited modification status and commercial loan delinquencies grew by million nonperforming loans increased million or compared to september this growth was almost entirely driven by a million increase in consumer loans and within that million related to residential real estate primarily as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the term net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million up million from the third quarter commercial net chargeoffs increased by million to million driven by specific commercial real estate related borrowers and included certain portfolio management activity consumer net chargeoffs were relatively stable at million annualized net chargeoffs to total loans in the fourth quarter was basis points an increase of only basis points compared to the same period last year as you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans was the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 at quarter end down slightly from last quarter we believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of loan losses in the current portfolio slide highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses throughout the year in the fourth quarter reserves declined by million economic and qualitative factors represented million of the decline as improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our cre portfolio correspondingly our allowance for loan losses on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to as of december the remaining million of the decline in reserves was related to portfolio changes primarily driven by lower loan balances our yearend reserves of billion have increased materially year overyear and as i mentioned before now represent of loans turning to slide i wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of bbva usa with a focus on update since the call in november we expect this transaction to add significant value to our shareholders and were excited about the power of the combined franchises we remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time we announced the deal including the million of expense saves through enhanced operational efficiencies through time we do expect to generate additional meaningful revenue synergies which will make the economics of the transaction even more compelling since the announcement weve continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction notably weve established crossfunctional business teams to support the integration submitted required regulatory applications and confirmed the mapping of the technology migration theres a lot of hard work ahead but based on our due diligence as well as the progress weve made to date working alongside the bbva usa team were confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our objectives this transaction will significantly accelerate our expansion efforts into attractive growth markets is financially compelling and leverages our technology and acquisition expertise in summary pnc reported a strong fourth quarter and a successful and were well positioned for and beyond during naturally the biggest variable impact in the economy will be the duration of this pandemic and along with that the efficacy of the government support plans as well as the vaccine distribution our current expectations are for real gdp to return to prerecession levels by the end of the year and the fed funds rate to remain near zero throughout the duration of the year looking ahead at the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we expect total average loans to be stable to down modestly inside of that ppp loans are expected to be up approximately billion we expect nii to be down approximately which includes the impact of two fewer days in the first quarter excluding the impact of ppp net interest income is expected to decline approximately we expect total non interest income to be down midsingle digits within that other noninterest income is expected to be between million and million we expect total noninterest expense to be down in the midsingle digit range in regard to net chargeoffs we expect first quarter levels to be between million and million looking at the full year guidance we thought it would be helpful to provide our expectation for pncs standalone performance excluding any onetime costs related to the bbva usa transaction for the full year compared to the full year results we expect average loan growth to be down in the lowsingle digit range the significant increase in loan utilization during the beginning of the pandemic elevated average loan the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 balances in as you know which created a difficult backdrop for the full year average loan growth comparison however we do expect to have loan growth throughout resulting in lowsingle digit spot growth for the year we expect total revenue to be stable we expect expenses to be stable this represents im sorry back that up we expect revenues to be stable and this represents a current net interest income forecast of down modestly but we acknowledge potential deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast it is plausible and thats relative to revenues we expect our expenses to be stable and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately regarding the pending acquisition of bbva usa as i mentioned we recently filed the required applications and were still targeting a midyear close subject to regulatory approval bbva will not be releasing the results until later this month therefore we will not be providing updates to the previously disclosed financial metrics and estimates related to bbva usa at this time however in an effort to provide some context for the transaction in relation to our full year guidance assuming we close midyear and excluding integration costs we expect the acquisition to be approximately million accretive to pncs preprovision net revenue and all of that is consistent with our original assumptions and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions bryan k gill senior vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc okay kathy could you please open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks and good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a question on the outlook here for revenue full year are stable and obviously thats without thats a standalone basis right i just wanted to understand how you get there and whats going on given the fact that the guide for nii in is down and so if you can talk through what youre doing and how much of that is loan growth and yes thanks the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure so im glad you asked that question because i included that in the forecast in terms of our guidance for the full year that we expect total revenues to be stable and inside that our current net interest income forecast is down modestly but we do acknowledge potential for deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast so theres potential upside there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and its offset by higher fees robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc in terms of total revenue yeah in terms of that thats right thats right in regard to the nii its tough if you take a look in terms of the rate backdrop we had headwinds all during and we expect that to continue through we will put more money to work on the securities balances we do expect loan growth and there may be some room in terms on the liability side to reduce some of those costs so thats how we get to the nii component william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc one of the internal debates that were having so the forecast stays as the forecast stays but one of the internal debates that theres no winner on is this basic notion that as the fed continues the size of their balance sheet and grows it and we have loan growth towards the back end of that drives deposit growth right its a closed system robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and as that happens pnc benefits disproportionately at least has and i suspect will given some constraints on the largest banks on deposit growth which in turn gives us nii so we kind of say fine call nii flat but theres a macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the fed does its going to drive this opportunity betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i get that okay maybe you could speak a little bit to the loan growth and where thats going to come from thats probably the biggest single debate point that were having with investors right now what will drive it to come back up the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so rob can jump in here but a chunk of it simply comes back because utilizations are so low so as the economy comes back robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph okay not in commercial william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes as the economy comes back on you just see utilization and the basic revolvers we have but the other issues the delevering of the consumer balances ought to pick up once the vaccine is widely distributed and people kind of go back to more normalized behavior that remains to be seen but i think those are the two biggest opportunity sets robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and some consumer on the back end of the year as things normalize william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi hi sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey rob in response to the last question you alluded to the possibility of potentially investing a little of the securities portfolio the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co and i feel like you guys just have such a mass of money just sitting at the fed so weve had this back up in higher rates how much in your mind more attractive is it to potentially invest some of that stuff thats just sort of sitting there earning virtually nothing at this point william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well its more attractive than it was a couple of months ago robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph i think william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc you would have seen right that the outright security balances declined just as we got into the low low rates and the prepays we have been more aggressively investing money of recent well continue to do that we have a lot to go as you point out we dont do it all at once and you should assume that will accelerate into a steepening curve and moderate into a flattening curve as you would expect but we have an awful lot of money to put to work and then that that issue compounds again if we get the deposit growth that at least i expect is going to happen across the industry given the macro factors robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and thats that piece that we talk about that could be potentially above our current forecast william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then the second question i know its not necessarily huge for me but i think a lot of investors are trying to figure out what is this new round of ppp going to look like just sort of qualitatively how are you guys thinking about your own participation in it to the degree that any benefit is baked into the guidance for how does that end up looking quantitatively as well robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 sure i can answer that so particularly as it relates to the first quarter so we will participate in the second wave we anticipate that the total balances because the program is smaller will be less than the first wave but to just give you numbers we finished with the average balances under the first ppp program of billion we expect billion of forgiveness in the first quarter so that first wave would be about billion and then for the second wave we expect to originate approximately billion in the first quarter so that would take our total ppp in the first quarter to about billion so thats how i size it and thats how i think it beyond that well have to see because the levels of forgiveness and how that goes is fluid r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you very much robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc if i can follow up on the last question rob can you help us understand i know theres so many moving parts with part one and part two robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc you had said i think you had less forgiveness in the fourth quarter than you expected can you help us understand just like what the ppp benefit to nii was in and then how much are you expecting in or how much that informs flat to slightly down nii for the year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 yeah i think you probably best ken here to look at the first quarter and give you a number of that billion that we expect to have in total ppp loans the nii will be approximately million and inside that million and these are approximate numbers approximately million represents the forgiveness of that billion that we expect from program one ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then therell be some moving parts with regards to like run rating versus forgiveness as we go through the year as well robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah thats right and well keep you posted but thats my best thinking for the first quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and the second question is following on your bbva second half ppnr comments rob just wondering is that million also inclusive of the initial saves youre expecting this year or is that just like a what theyre bringing over kind of on day one because i think you did say you were expecting some saves to happen in the back half robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes its that ken there are some saves in the back half that are included in that number ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and has there anything changed with regards to your expected trajectory of the timing around when you think the saves would come in robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc no no our original assumptions are holding ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it great thanks very much rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator operator instructions and i have a followup question from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thank you for taking this one i guess one of the questions that ive gotten about you guys over the course of the last couple of months since the bbva transaction was announced is just given the somewhat different credit profiles between legacy pnc and the bbva franchise how much of that loan book that youll carry over do you anticipate keeping and will there be some sort of a runoff portfolio that sort of impairs what would eventually be a higher growth trajectory from that franchise or are we going to be sort of steady state and all the kind of stuff will get rationalized in the upfront mark william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres a lot embedded in that question but theres parts of bbvas balance sheet that and its more sectors its not necessarily quote credit risk but the things we choose to focus on versus what we dont so theres parts of their balance sheet that will runoff over time at the same time because of many of our lending specialties and the presence well have in the market we expect that we will grow balances in the new franchise so youre going to see both our base assumptions assume a run down i dont know when the trough is rob but a run down in balance sheet robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc for a short period of time before we sort of offset it with new growth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah beginning and william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so there is some revenue reconfiguration along those lines william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 but of course well keep you up to speed we dont own the bank yet william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so that will be something that once we close well be able to give you more color r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah good no that makes sense and i appreciate sort of the early color there so thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator and our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo security sic securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi you had positive operating leverage last year your efficiency improved fourth quarter it didnt look as good though was there anything thats unusual and also your guidance for next year is for flat operating leverage ph when i know you guys pride yourself in having positive operating leverage on a core basis thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc you want me to answer that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hit him with the fourth quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure the fourth quarter most of those expenses that jumped as you saw were incentive compensation for much much higher activity particularly in our harris williams unit so those are good expenses when harris williams and activity goes up thats a good thing but theres obviously expenses associated with that and then there are some seasonal things that we expect but youre right for the full year our expense management was successful full positive operating leverage for the year which was our objective and we did that when you look at were going to fight for it were not the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 folding on that weve got revenues stable and expenses stable so its going to require tight expense management but now were going to battle for it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and as far bbva your loan loss reserve assumptions ph might have improved since you only had you had the pfizer vaccine out you didnt have moderna or jjs will the outlook be a little bit better on the same reasons you had reserve releases when you have a better outlook for bbva thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we didnt even actually have pfizer out when those were put together so in theory youre right mike robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well again we dont own the bank theyre going to release william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc these are our assumptions robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc in our assumptions yeah in our assumptions all else being equal yeah theyd be less mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess we just have to wait for bbvas results to come out and then we can hopefully get an update from you okay thanks a lot robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob i wanted to followup on your comments about investing more of the securities portfolio into a curve steepening some of the dynamics around qe have led agency mbs spreads over treasuries to turn negative and you guys along with most other banks have a substantial portion of your securities the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc portfolios invested in agency mbs so it seems like the benefits of a steeper curve are being tempered somewhat by those dynamics can you give a little bit of color on where youre seeing the opportunity to invest on the security side and then maybe on the lending side if you could remind us what percentage of the loan portfolio is anchored to the short versus the long end of the interest rate complex and just frame how we think about the benefit to pnc of a steeper curve on the lending side as well william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc youre way too far into the weeds but you should assume that for now in terms of where current spreads against the mix of the portfolio wed otherwise normally be buying our reinvestment yield is about basis points how we get there im not going to go into detail robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the front book william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but thats well not our front book thats on average what we would be purchasing today robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the fixed and floating component and the one and threemonth libor component of our loans i dont remember those numbers off the top robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean were short on the commercial loans they tend to be threeyear type commitments and on the consumer its floating william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 the other thing that makes us somewhat unique is our entire debt stack is floating as well and you see that in our liability costs thats one of the reason our wholesale funding cost has dropped last time i looked much more materially than most of our competitors bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and separately on expenses some investors have expressed a little bit of concern that after so many years of you guys having the benefit of being able to reinvest a strong growth from blackrock into the business that the loss of that strong growth is going to make it more challenging to continue to invest at the same pace without hurting the efficiency ratio rob i heard your cip target sounds like theyre robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc unchanged for the year but i was hoping you guys can just broadly speak to that notion william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont fully understand robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc its more driven by cip rather than bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah correct william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes i mean our investment capability obviously comes from just the firm growing and then recycling expenses which well continue to do blackrocks growth through time in terms of revenue to us was helpful of course as we go forward here were and assuming we close the which is good assumption the bbva acquisition we have a whole new set of expenses in effect to recycle that gives rise to this investment indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and revenues the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so it wont slow down our investment william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc at all yes bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay yeah thanks bill thanks guys thats helpful if i can squeeze one more in on credit so i had a question on how to about the excess capital as it relates to slide so in the absence of the bbva deal one could make the case that that reserve rate on day one is the level that we should revert to once we get past covid and so any level of reserves above that could be viewed as excess but can you speak to the reasonableness of that thought process and then maybe frame for us how to think about the onboarding of bbva onto this slide and what it would mean for your reserve rate and excess capital william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont think i mean look our reserve as of today and presumably their reserve as of today is reflective of best expectations of the forward economy here so theyll release their results and youll be able to look at that indiscernible i dont know how we can indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc you had sort of two parts to that question one was the bbva usa overlay and thats to come when their results come out the second question just is sort of what is the normal level of reserves under cecl was our day one after cecl
