respected leader whose deep industry knowledge and strong financial acumen make him the right choice to serve as northerns next cfo turning to our third quarter performance our results benefited from strong market performance but also reflect continued positive momentum across our businesses relative to the prior year trust fees were up net interest income grew and excluding notables earnings per share grew sic importantly we generated positive trust fee and total operating leverage while continuing to make significant investments in our business and infrastructure we also returned million to shareholders within wealth management we generated strong yearoveryear trust fee growth of and reached record aum levels our new business momentum improved reflecting the maturation of a number of initiatives started over the past to months global family office performed particularly well generating midsingle digit organic growth both in the third quarter and yeartodate international relationships which have been an area of focus in recent years drove a healthy portion of this growth including a marquee win sourced through collaboration with asset servicing demonstrating the power of our one northern trust strategy asset management generated positive liquidity flows for the seventh consecutive quarter and positive flows in tax advantaged equity active fixed income and alternatives this translated into healthy organic aum growth despite continued pressure on index products continued strong investment performance is supporting our organic growth with active fixed income outperforming benchmarks over one three and fiveyear time frames ntams performance is also attributable to leveraging our one northern trust strategy to deliver clients the solutions and capabilities of the entire firm yeartodate ntam has launched new products including the treasury only money market fund that has generated nearly billion inflows in less than six months largely from gfo clients our asset servicing business performed well in the quarter transaction volumes were healthy capital markets activities were up doubledigits for the second quarter and new business growth continues to be booked at attractive margins as we discussed our goal is to generate new business that is scalable weve shifted our focus to opportunities that require lower levels of incremental costs and to crossselling products and services to existing clients as an example this week we announced an expansion of our relationship with artemis a leading ukbased asset manager with more than billion in aum wherein all trading activities for artemiss equity funds and all otc and exchangetraded derivatives will be outsourced to northern we will now support the complete life cycle of these investments from execution to custody including fund administration depositary global custody and transfer agency services for its uk and luxembourgdomiciled funds while it will take time to realize the full benefits of the pivot in our strategy it should lead to more profitable growth as our business mix shifts during the third quarter we proudly celebrated our companys 135th anniversary the core principles of service expertise and integrity upon which our company was founded still guide us today as we look forward were taking steps to strengthen the foundation position the firm for higher underlying growth and enhance our operational efficiency all while continuing to invest to meet the evolving needs of our clients and to create value for all our stakeholders for years to come and with that ill turn it over to jason to review our financial performance for the quarter jason jason j tyler executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our third quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page this morning we reported third quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was our reported results included a million pretax gain on an equity investment and a million escrow payment associated with our existing visa swap agreements together these two notable items boosted other operating income by million pretax and million after tax trust investment and other servicing fees totaled billion a sequential increase and an increase compared to last year net interest income on an fte basis was a record million up sequentially and up from a year ago our assets under custody and administration were up sequentially and as compared to the prior year our assets under management were up sequentially and yearoveryear and overall our credit quality remains very strong excluding notable items in all periods other noninterest income was down sequentially and down over the prior year revenue was up sequentially and up on a yearoveryear basis expenses were up slightly less than sequentially and up over the prior year and earnings per share grew sic turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend reflecting a yearoveryear increase asset servicing fees totaled million custody and fund administration fees were million up yearoveryear reflecting the impact from strong underlying equity markets and a weaker us dollar both comparisons were dampened by the client exits we discussed last quarter which are now fully reflected in our run rate assets under management for asset servicing clients were trillion up over the prior year investment management fees within asset servicing were million up a strong yearoveryear due to favorable markets and to a lesser extent new business activities moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarterend up yearoveryear trust investment and other servicing fees for wealth management clients were million up yearoveryear due primarily to strong equity markets moving to page and our balance sheet and net interest income trends our average earning assets were flat on a linkedquarter basis as a decrease in loans was offset by an increase in securities our average liquidity levels remained strong with highly liquid assets comprising of our deposits and more than of total earning assets on average the duration of our securities portfolio is years and the total balance sheet duration continues to be less than year net interest income was million and our net interest margin was this strength was attributable to several factors first deposits came in modestly better than our expectations average deposits were billion down less than from second quarter levels and noninterestbearing deposits remained stable at of the mix second deposit pricing improved we had several large client deposits with very thin spreads rolloff and they were replaced by a similar level of more attractively priced deposits and as expected we realized a very strong deposit beta on institutional accounts relative to the recent rate cuts and third given especially conducive market conditions we saw higherthanaverage quarterly contributions from transactional and other items in the aggregate these items elevated third quarter nii by approximately million to million turning to page as reported noninterest expense was approximately billion in the third quarter down sequentially and up as compared to the prior year excluding notable items in both previous periods as listed on the slide expenses in the third quarter were up approximately sequentially and yearoveryear northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 now lets go back and review our core expenses from the quarter which exclude all notable items compensation expense was up over the prior year reflecting the impact of this years base pay adjustments modest levels of hiring associated with our modernization initiative and underlying growth in the business and unfavorable currency movements compensation expense was flat sequentially outside services expense increased relative to the prioryear period largely due to incremental modernization and resiliency spend it was also flat sequentially equipment and software expense increased sic yearoveryear mostly related to higher depreciation and amortization expense sequentially it was up sic excluding notables we generated over basis points of trust fee operating leverage over basis points of overall operating leverage and our expensetotrust fee ratio improved by basis points on a linkedquarter basis as we look out to the fourth quarter we expect our total operating expenses to be up approximately relative to the third quarter turning to page our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter and we continue to operate at levels well above our required regulatory minimum our common equity tier ratio under the standardized approach remained flat at as capital accretion was offset by a slight increase in rwa levels our tier leverage ratio was up basis points from the prior quarter at quarterend our unrealized pre tax loss on availableforsale securities was million we returned million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of million and common stock repurchases of million now before starting the qa portion of the call on a personal note i want to offer a quick thank you it has been a joy and an honor to serve as cfo for northern for the last five years its been a pleasure to work with the analyst community and the worldclass investors we have as shareholders i wish dave fox the very best as he takes on the new role i work closely with dave since he joined northern years ago hes a strategic forward thinking executive and hes going to play a critical role in driving impactful change within the company and ensuring that its positioned for longterm success and with that please open the line for questions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from steven chubak with wolfe research jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning steve sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning this is sharon actually filling in for steven this morning jason earlier this year you had talked about the asset sensitivity across the different categories on the balance sheet so cash sensitivity to short rates loans and securities about a third floating can you give us a quick update on the floating rate mix just given that youve done a couple of securities repositioning actions since the last time you updated it jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp im sorry i didnt catch i just want to make sure i answer your question really precisely can you do it again a little louder sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc yeah sure sorry so earlier this year you had talked about the asset sensitivity across the different balance sheet categories cash sensitive to short rates and loans as well and securities book about a third floating just given some of the securities repositioning actions youve taken since that update can you give us like a quick marktomarket on the floating rate mix jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp yeah floating is about at this point sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc okay great and then as we look at our expense forecast beyond can you just frame how much of this years expense growth was inflated by investments in resiliency when those investments should be completed and whether we should expect those investment dollars to fall to the bottom line or get redeployed elsewhere in the franchise jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp and just to clarify youre asking about the expense investments in modernization and resiliency and how thats going to trend over time northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc yes jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp so yeah so we do expect that that will continue for the next at least two three quarters but at some point likely late next year well start to see it decline we dont have any plans to dollar for dollar thematically redeploy that somewhere else this is more of a distinct effort to try and address our desires to improve modernization and some other technology and automation efforts in the business sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc okay great thank you very much michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning ebrahim how are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good and congrats jason and david on your new roles just maybe following up on expense and more broadly going back to the leadership changes that were announced back in september maybe mike jason give us a perspective of i think higher frustration from investors from time to time around just the focus on operational efficiency kind of not translating into bottom line results should we read into these changes realignment as something a little bit out of the ordinary in terms of what it means for operational efficiency going forward would love any perspective there and how we should think about incremental expense spend i heard what you responded jason but im just wondering if all of this is baked into the expense base as we come out of the fourth quarter or will there be more additional expenses and investments tied to resiliency thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 sure ebrahim its mike ill start off so i would say we believe in structure following strategy and so the organizational changes that we announced in september reflect the strategy that weve put in place going back over a year ago and weve tried to keep very straightforward which is focused on strengthening the foundation optimizing our growth and driving productivity and we already mentioned the changes with jason and dave but importantly one of the other big changes was creating the role of a coo chief operating officer which pete cherecwich will be the coo or is the coo of the company and with petes decades of experience in managing both complex client relationships but also global operations hes really well positioned to drive operational excellence resiliency and also scalable growth so to your point we are very much trying to align the organization in such a way that we can get greater scale and operating efficiencies and resiliency out of the company on that front teresa parker took over the role of president of asset servicing for pete to work through that organizational transition to ensure that we do it in a way that we continue to be clientfocused and differentiate ourselves in that way and likewise steve fradkin is vice chair and importantly is focused on the one northern trust strategy and operationalizing all the things that we do on that front so feel very good about the organizational changes to help us drive the strategy ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess if i may follow up on just the nii question jason for you it was a positive surprise this quarter when we look at that million in nii this quarter if we get some gradual rate cuts given the positioning of the balance sheet if the deposit backdrop is stabilizing should we expect nii continues to grow from the third quarter levels jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp well theres some good news in the nii results for sure and even though it looks like deposits were just flat underneath that we had meaningful exits of some very thinly large deposits and we knew that coming into that those were going to leave coming into the quarter thats part of the reason we anticipated deposits being down but we were pleasantly surprised by the fact that in other areas of the organization that level of deposit was replaced with much more attractively priced deposits you add on to that we didnt see the typical seasonal decline that we go through in august in particular and so its not just the deposit levels holding in but its the underlying nature of the deposits and where they are now is much better that said if you look into the fourth quarter were anticipating rate cuts and as much as we feel good about the strength of the deposit book right now its hard to offset the deposits fully and so an increase from here wed have to call it unlikely its possible but thats why we think in general were looking at a million to million level for fourth quarter in nii which is still good still very strong but would be slightly down ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you ebrahim northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 operator we will take our next question from alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp hey alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks hey good morning everybody and congrats to the whole team on various moves just to level set the nii discussion just one more time so jason sounds like q3 had million to million of sort of elevated transactional activity do you expect that to basically fall off in q4 and thats whats partially driving the kind of the sequential decline and maybe expand on kind of what those were and on deposits this is the right jumping off point to use as far as cost of deposits go right and then obviously deposit betas are likely to be fairly high from there but im just kind of trying to level set on the goforward potentially beyond the fourth quarter guidance that youve highlighted jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp sure so let me try and go in the reverse order on deposits on the launch point feel like this is a good level and then if i come back to the third quarter items theres the core this asset and liability pricing but theres also another element of you get fx swap activity fhlb dividends premium am fte adjustments repo activity leverage and theres a whole basket of other things it doesnt add up to a lot but and theres usually theres puts and takes in that most of those went in our direction this quarter and so thats that million to million elevation but the way you ask the question is thoughtful because we actually dont expect all those to just go away into the next quarter its just part of it is the environment the way it is right now with the way rates are it gives us more of an opportunity to do more fx swaps and to have other activity that adds to nii and so we dont expect that lift to fully come down it gives more of an explanation of why we saw the elevation going from second to third quarter and so that million to million largely is a reflection of some of those items going to more normalized levels but also impact of rate actions with different central banks that are going to have a drag on the million alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right thank you for clarifying that and then a question on expenses for you guys just with respect to maybe longerterm expense growth algorithm and mike i heard your answer to the previous questions around the organizational changes i think you guys have made which are obviously substantial and hopefully can further align the growth in the business with the expense structure but i guess in the past you talked about maybe this 5ish percent bogey for expense growth over time hoping to be below that this year is obviously shaking out to be north of and theres some marketrelated items and stronger revenues to come along with that so its good news but maybe help us sort of summarize given these changes where you expect the firms kind of longerterm expense growth to be over the next kind of a couple of years northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp so alex were continuing to be focused on driving positive fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage with the level of our expensetotrust fee ratio at this point for this quarter yeartodate its still above our target range of to so we want to continue to grind that down into that target range and likewise from a margin perspective pretax margin i want to be in the low as a target area as well so thats the first driving goal and then to accomplish that weve had strong revenues this year which has enabled us to achieve the leverage that we have that said cant always count on the strength in the markets and a rate environment that may drive that so we need to bring the absolute expense growth rate down further and so that will be the objective as we go into is to achieve that operating leverage and also increase the probability of hitting it by driving down our expense growth rate below the level that its been alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats helpful thank you guys michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning hi good morning how are you doing michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp very good jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp how are you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so couple of questions here one on mike you mentioned the deepening of relationships as a key focus for growth going forward could you help us understand how that pivot is affected is that different from what northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 youve been doing before is it more just thinking of the last conversation is it more resources to hire or is it more products to deliver and then how should we be thinking about where in the organization you have the most opportunity is this asset servicing asset management is it investment management is it the wealth platform help us understand how youre thinking about where the pockets of opportunity are richest for those deepening of relationships michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so betsy to your point that is our one northern trust strategy which is to ensure that all the businesses and all the groups within the company are working together to produce the best outcomes for our clients and likewise for other stakeholders and from a client perspective it is a combination of a number of things so first it is the businesses working more closely right from the beginning if you will so going to market and opportunities so for example with asset servicing and asset management providing an overall solution for clients as opposed to necessarily starting with one and then trying to crosssell if you will the second opportunity on that front as far as where the opportunities are definitely between asset servicing and asset management but i would also highlight with wealth management as well a lot of work has been done to ensure that the linkages between those two businesses are very strong and that we are thinking about the needs of our wealth management clients as we produce new investment management products as i mentioned we launched a number of new funds this year that were really off of the back of the research that was done for some of the needs of our specific client base well continue to do that in order to provide the right solutions for them also as far as the types of capabilities that we have to deliver to your point it is new products or new services so i mentioned the artemis example thats just the latest client where were providing a new capability to them of outsourced trading what we call integrated trading solutions which we launched a number of years ago and weve built that business up and taken this to a level where that capability works for clients of size like artemis so a lot of opportunity on that front as well and so as you can see oh go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc no you finish up sorry michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp no go ahead betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks very much for those examples that was very useful i just wonder holistically then as were thinking about not just the expense line but just the overall impact on profitability when you think about what youre looking to accomplish and the opportunities you see in this pivot how do you think thats going to translate into return on tangible or return on common equity michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 yeah so theres no question that to the extent we already have the client relationship that the incremental services that we provide to them are more scalable for us and so thats where it translates into more profitability overall the second thing i would mention betsy on that front is in thinking about the type of business that were pursuing the most as we say we want more scalable growth on that front and what we really mean on that front is focusing on new opportunities that require less in the way of new resources so to the extent that we can win the business that is again more scalable for us areas where weve had a lot of success for example this year with asset owners in america but also in europe where were providing custody to them in a way that the incremental resources required both in people but also in technology are less than if we are adding other services or to other segments that would require that that translates into a higher level of profitability overall so thats the objective on that front betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks so much really appreciate it michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning mike how are you mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good well i see years bestinclass private banking relationships all the one northern trust initiative and everything else happening and then i see a stock price that has lost its premium versus its trust bank peers and even trades points below morgan stanley or something so im just wondering how much and maybe this is an opportunity and if it is youre going to let us know why but how much of this is business mix how much of this is the environment and how much of this is execution and i hear what you have to say strategy drives structure drives execution should drive results and i guess that would drive the stock price but im just trying to wonder that how or why the same cast of characters can generate better organic growth in their new roles and i saw the press release come out with the cfo and ceo and head of wealth and head of asset servicing and head of family office all changing at the same time i just havent seen something like that or i dont recall something like that so mike you have a big perspective on that so if youd give that perspective on why you think this will change mike thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so mike its a combination of both putting people into the new roles where we can leverage their experience but also weve brought in talent from the outside so just over about a year ago year and a half ago we brought in daniel gamba to run asset management and so we want to have both the benefit of people who really understand everything you talked about as far as northern trust and how were clientfocused but also new blood and new ideas from the outside and well continue to do that as we go forward also to drive it it does come back to execution i mean as to where were focused and so thats what were trying to drive thats where we spend our time on that front and that will then ultimately drive not only the earnings but also the multiple for the stock i think that another big part of this is the strategy around where that growth comes from so thats why when we talk about the one northern trust aspect of it and the type of growth that also affects the stability and growth rate of the earnings as well so its not just the earnings themselves but its the quality as you know so thats what its all directed at to ultimately create value through the earnings and the multiple to drive the stock price mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then maybe just to ask one followup so the incremental extra that we might be able to expect by that fresh perspective the managers bring in their new roles maybe dave as it relates to the cfo function i know jason is right next to you but incrementally what would you like to emphasize a little bit more maybe its already started and jason what would you like to emphasize a little bit more in wealth to take it to the next level thanks michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so what i would emphasize with those two and then i do think its a good opportunity for jason just to give his initial thoughts here but it is around the more scalable parts of our company overall so not just products or service but company and that is our wealth management business and our asset management business so we are trying to grow those businesses organically faster than we have in the past and so thats the tilt or the push mike on that front and i think what dave you and others will quickly get comfortable with his deep understanding of the business his strategic approach to it and also understanding of value creation but jason do you want to talk just a little bit about just some of your initial views jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp yeah sure mike so obviously ive already been on the road a lot and i know the business reasonably well and just spent time just the last few weeks la new york texas im going to a really good client event tonight in san francisco but i do think theres opportunity for us to do more and a framework to think about mike is one way you can think about the business the markets that were in the segments that were in which gets to where do we have specialization that we can deepen and hope to leverage more and then different solutions for our clients and you know really well we have a phenomenal client base and great talent across the organization and so i think its very clear that there is more that we can do and using that framework as a way that i think we can talk about it in the future where were putting the initiatives in each of those different dimensions to try to grow the business faster northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator we will take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning brennan how are you brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc im good im good thanks for taking my question so i actually wanted to circle back on expenses and totally appreciate the commitment that was made to operating leverage in driving down the expenses to fees but based on the fourth quarter guide i think my quick math suggested that were going to be north of on expense growth in and jason as your sort of last act as at least cfo in name right right before the press release went out you had said that you made another commitment to keep sub5 and so dave is an internal candidate so does that commitment hold with the new cfo how should we think about it and like importantly i understand operating leverage matters and whatnot but expense growth has really been an issue its gotten more elevated here recently in recent years compounded a bit with inflation but its not a new issue for northern how is it that you guys can get this under control to a point where you can have a more steady cadence of operating leverage without having the bar quite high michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so brennan part of it is the organizational change so just fundamentally that will involve centralizing a number of operations that are now more distributed and so its more than just ill say committing to it its actually making changes to do that the other part of it is you have to make the investments where theyre required and when theyre required thats part of managing this for the long term and in the environment that weve been in as far as just the ill call it the level of volatility and risk thats in the broader environment we felt that making these investments in the foundation is the right thing to do longer term now that does require or create some level of variability in what those are but when we think about what were doing on the technology front for example the modernization that jason has mentioned where its quickly trying to move off of endoflife platforms transitioning to the cloud which definitely requires investment to do increasing the automation of the changes we make within technology ensuring we have redundancy to the extent that there are incidence doing more testing of all of those platforms to ensure that we have the stability on that front making sure that when we are working with thirdparty providers that we understand their resiliency as well so theres a number of things that weve done and are doing to kind of harden and solidify that core because we think thats a good investment for it not just from a ill say risk and resiliency perspective but also from a client northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 experience perspective and also from an efficiency perspective so thats why weve tried to be very clear on what were doing and why were doing it and why we think ultimately not only is that good for the clients but its good for shareholders as well its going to drive highquality growth as we go forward and thats the plan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay i look forward to getting some meat on those bones in the coming quarter so thats great if i could transition to the balance sheet it looks like loans pulled back a decent amount this quarter i dont think you touched on it what caused that and how should we be thinking about loan growth or the outlook for any growth or further decline in balances from here jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp sure ive noted before the loans and deposits can be very spiky and the headline is theres nothing strategic or creating of a trend that we see and what we experienced in the quarter and then in terms of growth going forward weve had initiatives in the past to specifically grow the loan book we dont have that initiative right now were not trying to shrink it either and so you should think about growth in the loan book coming alongside growth in the overall client franchise a lot of our lending ironically the deposits are more on the institutional side the lending is more on the wealth side of the business and so the correlation will be more tied to growth in the wealth business brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from glenn schorr with evercore jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp how are you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning maybe another question on the wealth side like we always want to grow wealth its a great business and youre great at it you talked about the concept maybe drill down a little bit more because i think youve been making some investments in people products and new geographies maybe talk a little bit about that and include maybe a comment about the hamilton lane collaboration that you mentioned that you had a press release on yesterday thanks so much jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp yeah so ill start so i think what you should see is us investing even more aggressively at the upper end we do really well at the high end of the market and you see it very clearly in what dave has been able to do with the gfo business because thats the on average those are our largest clients and thats been growing faster than the rest of wealth if you were to look beneath that youd be able to see that even within the regions were doing better at the higher end thats where our franchise and thats where our value proposition holds well and we feel great about that we can invest even more heavily there in revenuegenerating in clientgenerating professionals and in the talent that supports those clients from an experience perspective so a lot of rias brag about having one or maybe two actec fellows and those are the most respected people in trust and estate planning northern has or and so when clients are trying to go deeper in their estate work more complicated planning weve got the professionals to do that and thats part of the reason why just in that area we do well but also the same thing in investment advising and in banking and so the more we invest at the upper end of the market thats where we feel were going to have a better return so we announced a distinct ultrahighnetworth group just this past quarter and were dedicating professionals to just that area where theyre going to be dealing with clients at the very upper end of wealth advisory and working closely with the family office business to bring those capabilities into the more traditional wealth space for us and so theres a lot of things we were excited about that where we feel were planting seeds for growth and then i also look at just the talent were able to bring on board really exciting hires across the franchise that we think are going to be helpful to growing the business growing the client franchise michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp and glenn on hamilton lane that is a partnership that were excited about which is with our asset servicing business to provide even better data and analytics on the private investments of our large institutional clients as you know as asset allocators portfolios have moved more and more to private markets and alternatives the capabilities required to due diligence them analyze them has gone up and weve had our offering front office solutions which looks across the entire portfolio that weve been very successful with and this is an addition to that that will provide even better as i said data analytics to it so very positive and promising glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right thanks so much for all that michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp okay northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 operator we will take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp hey gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good how are you congratulations jason mike you touched on northern one sic one northern a number of times in your prepared remarks as well as your answers to questions as outsiders investors how should we measure the success of what youre trying to achieve i mean your peers are using similar types of programs as well or strategies and i was wondering if you could somehow point us to some metrics that we can review regularly just to measure your success in pursuing this strategy michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure gerard so to your point using one is not unique the fact that one northern trust is what is unique about it because its our business that were focused on with it and its something that gerard is really important id say within the company but also in the marketplace within the company we want to make sure that were breaking down silos and that everybody across the company regardless of what business or group youre in are working together in order to get the right outcomes and that can be certainly as weve talked about on the client front but it can also be in ensuring that were getting the right efficiencies across the businesses so that cuts across that way and then as i mentioned certainly going to market and with the client were stronger as northern trust than we are as any one of our businesses alone so thats whats behind it to your point on measuring it the way that were doing it is we start with the specific objectives of what were trying to do so thinking about specifically i mentioned okay how many times did we go to market with a new opportunity where involved two or all three of our businesses to do that thats something that we can measure granted its an internal measurement or metric but it has to start there if its going to flow through to the kpis that the key performance indicators that were then looking at which really then its going to be in our organic growth rate and so thats what were trying to drive is a higher organic growth rate and so to do that we need to see that collaboration between the businesses that then flows into our financial performance overall when you add into it the markets and the impact from that so ultimately youre going to see it in the financial performance and we can provide ill say some kpis as we go forward here thats part of what i mentioned with steve fradkin who as you know has worked across all of these businesses in one way or another over his career and thats why were looking to not just say one northern trust but actually ensure that were doing it by operationalizing a lot of those activities gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and i apologize for screwing up the name northern one with one northern trust but thank you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jason coming back i know you touched on the net interest income expectations for the fourth quarter and with the balance sheet duration i think you said the entire balance sheet is about a year and securities portfolio is a little longer than that if the forward curve is correct and we do see a fed funds rate by the end of next year in that range lets call it and the long end of the curve stays anchored above so we get a positive slope in the curve im not asking for a guidance number on nii but generally is that a favorable net interest income environment for you folks or can you share some color there jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp for various reasons we came shorter on the securities portfolio and so the rest of the balance sheet is pretty stable cash is what it is and the loan book we havent done anything to strategically change the duration of that effectively so the duration of the balance sheet and nii moves largely with what we do with the securities portfolio and we did come shorter that played out well for us we did it for a variety of reasons one was a view of the yield curve and again that played out well for us at this point if we look at what the yield curve is telling us its obviously going to be more of a headwind going into next year so especially if we see five six seven rate cuts theres were not going to change our risk tolerances our philosophy our approach on how we manage the balance sheet so thats going to be a headwind that said there are some offsets to it that are occurring just in how we normally manage the portfolio for advancements one we are feeling better about the stability of the deposit level so that gives us the ability to consider using more indiscernible second is we did see a rise effectively in the base of the deposit book and so we think deposit levels are positive and then theres still a slight benefit in the next year from the reinvestment of securities that are maturing not as much as what we would have seen before but there is some and so those are just some of the puts and takes and youre right its too early for us to give a guidance but i did want to make sure people realize all the different factors that are playing into it there are some puts as well as the takes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and is it fair to say that i think you pointed it out to us in your q when you give us the interest sensitivity table that you guys are asset sensitive presently at the end of third quarter is that a fair statement jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp yeah and thanks for clarifying that i should have mentioned that in my summary of where we are gerard so there is slight asset sensitivity at this point just largely coming from the actions weve taken in the balance sheet over the last couple of years northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc appreciate it thank you so much jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp you bet operator we will take our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thanks good morning and congrats to you and everyone else on the organizational changes hey a question for you jason and mike could chime in too maybe but just going back to the organic growth comments and i appreciate all of the comments youve discussed in qa in the wealth segment first and foremost i think were focusing on organic revenue growth as opposed to asset growth so i just want to confirm that and do you see more of that organic growth coming internally so from lets say selling more or providing more northern trust investment managed product say doing more lending potentially within the wealth segment other things that you can do internally as opposed to getting new customers so would we see more of the organic growth revenue growth coming from that and if you could just think of maybe just what type of target organic growth rate are you looking for in wealth over time jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp yeah so let me start with the end we have talked about somewhere around a level of organic growth for the business overall weve historically said that wed like to see that we should expect a higher amount coming from asset servicing and a little bit lower amount from wealth i think we should try to be more have more of an expectation that thats balanced and so i think in the mediumterm a to number for wealth is reasonable if we start to break it down of where thats coming from its got to be a combination of both new clients and doing more with existing clients but within the existing client base theres a lot of different categories that people should think about and i want to try and focus on a couple to give a sense of where were focusing because its less for us about thinking about more product utilization weve talked about that but its not something that we would aggressively target and even more lending if that comes organically within our philosophy and risk tolerances great but not an area where we see were going to be pushing the envelope and changing our risk tolerances northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 and so its more thinking about our wallet share with clients thinking about different solutions we can do with them and also at the upper end of the market to the extent that our overall client base shifts that way those clients are still in a mode of they still gain wealth and so their growth becomes our growth and our view is that thats organic as well if theyre creating more flows into our business not their market growth which we dont think of as organic but their new flows coming into the company then you couple that with what we should be able to do from a new client perspective and thats how were thinking about getting to that organic growth target level brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc super helpful and then maybe just a couple cleanup questions just one on loan pricing it looks like the yields went up is that a factor of the lag i think youve got about correct me if im wrong but i think three quarters of the book prices within three months thats variable rate and then theres a portion that prices over a longer time period so just maybe if you can talk about the pricing relative to rates in that book and then just one on expenses and thanks for all the commentary on expenses its great one question there would be that expense growth which just looks like this year youre targeting to bring that down if you have a really strong revenue year and youre generating positive operating leverage on total revenue and your expense trust fees is moving towards your goal is it possible that youd still have expense growth that could be or higher in that scenario jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp well first on the lags you got them right in terms of the month lag but just keep in mind theres a small portion in both business that is daily as well thats tied more to the extent that clients have more mutual funds but thats a small dynamic but youre right in general on the month lag and then on the expense growth and mike likely would want to comment on it here one of the things we talked about last year was that we want to try to decouple this the concept of if we have a strong revenue growth that should lead to a higher expense growth now some of that is inevitable because if were growing the business there are some expenses that are going to come along with it weve talked about the impact of markets on expenses but in general were trying to get away from that dynamic of projecting higher revenue growth and therefore tolerating higher expense growth it has to be more of an absolute and so thats why next year we came into this year with good confidence about being able to do or less coming to next year confidence level is even higher michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp agreed again same framework that weve talked about brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 yes yes thanks for that just on the pricing i was talking about the loans the variable rate loans on that not the market so is it three quarters of the book i think was of the loans were variable rate and reset within three months and the quarter resets later so the lag is what drove the yield up this quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp no overdrafts were a little bit higher thats what drove the yield up thanks i really appreciate you clarifying that and it is about its to thats floating in the loan book brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you so much yeah michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you operator we will take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp morning jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc jason yeah good morning just maybe on the capital return you guys have been stepping up the buybacks capital ratios are pretty flat and as you pointed out still well above the minimum so is this something we should expect this level for the intermediate term as profitability improves and rates are pretty stable so oci looks good can you keep this level up or is this sort of a high watermark on the buyback side jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp its maybe neither and so it is elevated but it could stay elevated for a while and if i walk through the pieces if you think about we have about a third of the net income going to dividends at this point we talk about it being to over time and its right at about a third right now if you take out the or even actually including the equity investment and the visa dynamic but us being at or thats the upper end of where we have been in cet1 now weve been at that level before and so were comfortable at that level but its the upper end but visa monetizing that obviously put a lot of liquidity available for share repurchase and so we are deploying that over time and we could continue to do that and still be at approximately this level maybe it comes down a little bit and the reason we tolerate that is we know at this point we still have other visa tranches coming over the next year or two and so it will be another roughly equivalent benefit and so would be okay for us to see northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 the cet1 come down from this a little bit but were thinking about it working through it and not trying to be overly aggressive at any point in time trying to take more of a thoughtful approach over several quarters not trying to do anything too aggressively jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right great and then when you think about the monetization of the second half of the visa shares thats obviously a tailwind do you contemplate maybe in longer term intermediate term of a lower than cet1 given the excess you have can you take it to or lower jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp were talking that far in the future i should let mike or michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp as jason say is a very strong level of capital and thats fine given say the broader environment and yet at the same time yeah absolutely are comfortable at lower levels as well so we feel very good about the capital position and the higher level of repurchases that we had in this quarter and as we move into next year jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp thanks jim operator we will take our next question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks morning couple of questions firstly mike jason you all mentioned the incremental spending for resilience modernization et cetera thats whats driven your expense growth to the level how much has that added would you say its a couple hundred basis points to the growth rate this year and if that goes away in three quarters does that bring you down to indiscernible below in the second half of next year any more clarification on that any more color on that michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 yes so vivek i think its difficult to ill say do an attribution on the and then project that all going forward i do think that one indication of the growth in the areas that i talked about there you see it in the higher growth rate that we have in equipment and in services so thats where youll see most of that technology spend come through but its not the that doesnt make up if you will jason has broken it down before there are other components that drive overall including the fact that we are levered to the market both on the revenue side and on the expense side so thats an aspect of what drove the rate to this year as we go forward as weve talked about vivek certainly looking to bring that down but well make the investments we need in technology and just more broadly to be able to accomplish what we want to overall vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah separate question for you mike there was a question earlier about the organizational changes why not use this opportunity where youre making such a lot of changes at one shot to bring in some more talent from the outside michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah over time vivek we will continue to do a combination of both and so there are a number of roles some of which we talked about here but other roles which we will go to market and bring in external talent for some time period that has been the strategy on management i mean as you know as much as you might say jason or dave or myself have been at northern for some time period but we had actually been at other places longer than weve been at northern so its a mix between promoting talent within because we think we have strong talent that we developed and having a strong talent development program if you will is a big part of what we want to do and at the same time bringing in talent from the outside so there will be plenty of opportunities to be able to do that vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for my followup jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2024 yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah so did i hear you right you said youre targeting organic growth in wealth of to how does that compare to the last few years and when you benchmark that versus peers how does that stack up when you see growth in the offstage private equity some other brokers it just seems like its more than that and maybe its just the sandbox where you compete thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president presidentwealth management northern trust corp sure so couple of things one its that would be higher than what its been over the last couple of years its been lower than that over the last couple of years before that we had been within that target range and so weve done it before and thats why we feel confident we can do it again and then from comparative purposes there are some firms that are doing better than that and some that are doing worse we want to be a winner we want to be at the top end of that range and i also think its very hard to compare some firms include banking some firms dont some firms include their product fees some firms dont and our model also is from a profitability perspective because of our financial model that we can do better from an earnings perspective if relative to our peers if we do same amount of growth thats our the profitability and the incremental profitability of our wealth business is very strong thats why thats part of the reason its such a good business the clients are embedded and theyre institutionalized and it makes it so that our growth leads to better economics for shareholders and so we feel really good about the feel good about that target and what it would mean for shareholders mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you operator we do not have any further questions i would like to turn the call back to jennifer childe for closing remarks jennifer childe senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp thanks for your
