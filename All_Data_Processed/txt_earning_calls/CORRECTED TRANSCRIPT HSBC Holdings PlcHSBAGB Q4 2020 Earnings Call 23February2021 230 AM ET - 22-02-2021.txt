management discussion section noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning to everybody in london and good afternoon to everybody in hong kong we have two objectives today the first is to take you through our q4 and full year results for and the second is to update you on progress against the change agenda we shared with you last february and the additional actions we are taking to deliver returns above the cost of capital ill start with a few reflections on the year just gone ewen will then take you through our full year and fourth quarter results then myself peter wong nuno matos and john hinshaw will share key details of our future plan ewen will then return to cover the financial implications of that plan let me start with first and most importantly our people provided amazing support to our customers and the communities we serve throughout the world we provided more than billion of wholesale lending support through government schemes and moratoria more than billion of additional relief for personal customers and more than trillion of loan debt and equity support for our wholesale customers however the numbers dont do justice to the efforts and energies that went into delivering them my colleagues acted with great purpose on a global scale they broke down silos they innovated and they delivered repeatedly in the toughest of circumstances they were customercentric in the truest sense of the term and our customer scores in the uk hong kong the us the middle east and mexico ph they decide second the economic impact of covid19 hit our profitability but we still delivered billion of adjusted pre tax profits and billion of reported profit before tax we also finished the year with a strong capital base of and increased our liquidity by around billion this proves two things this is an incredibly strong and resilient business particularly in asia which delivered billion of adjusted profit before tax but also opportunity exists even in a difficult year we increased mortgage lending in the uk and hong kong we grew our share of trade in asia despite the fall in volumes we grew our wealth balances in our target markets and we made billion of pbt in our india business which will be hugely important in the years to come third it was an incredibly important to us to resume dividend payments and we have declared a dividend of per share we are also resetting our dividend policy in the future to strike a balance between providing good income and supporting future growth in future were aiming to deliver sustainable cash dividends while transitioning towards a payout ratio of to from were no longer going to offer a scrip dividend and well consider share buybacks beyond the near term when no immediate opportunity for capital redeployment exists this is a measured policy that gives us the flexibility to invest and grow the business in future clearly fundamentally challenged many businesses so we also embarked on a major exercise to refresh our core purpose as an organization we consulted widely on this over a number of months speaking to thousands of colleagues and customers looking deeply into our history but also assessing the world of the future and we kept coming back to the same things hsbc has always focused on helping customers pursue the opportunities around them whether its individuals families or businesses our renewed purpose opening up a world of opportunity both captures this saying and sets a challenge opportunity never stands still it changes and hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 evolves with the world around us it is our job to keep adapting with it and to find and capture opportunities with the same spirit of entrepreneurialism and innovation that i feel represents hsbc at its very best we also saw in the power of an organization that can respond positively and at pace to radical change on a global scale hence you will see a new behavior within our value statements we get it done its deliberately expressed in uncomplicated language we can talk about what we want to achieve forever but execution is everything last february i promised we deliver our plans with pace and conviction which is exactly what weve done weve taken more than billion of costs out of the business and expect to exceed our billion cost saving target ahead of schedule and despite the pause in our redundancy program following the covid19 outbreak weve reduced our fte and contractor head count by around in achieving those head counts and cost savings we created a combined wholesale banking back office function serving both commercial banking and global banking we merged wealth and personal banking we reduced our senior management population by we appointed new people to just under of the top senior positions we reduced our us branch footprint by more than and cut our us adjusted cost base by we reduced ftes in our european nonringfenced bank by and we achieved billion of gross rwa savings in taking us more than halfway towards our threeyear gross riskweighted asset reduction target in just a single year however given the impact of low interest rates and covid we no longer expect to reach our targeted level of returns by that said we recognized the fundamental shifts in our environment in and reacted to them quickly the plans we are announcing today will build on this work and enable us to target a return on tangible equity at or above over the medium term and thats with the assumption that base interest rates remain at todays ultralow levels ewen will now take you through our results ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all a few quick words on the full year results the combined impact of covid19 and ultralow interest rates significantly impacted our reported profit before tax down from the prior year to billion on the positive side our asian business held up well with billion of adjusted pretax profits this included the second year running of billion of pretax profits from our indian franchise and further market share gains in our trade franchise in the region we did a good job of controlling operating costs down billion or well ahead of what we promised wed achieve a year ago we achieved exceptional growth in our deposit franchise up billion in the year or some and we strengthened our core capital base with our core tier ratio up basis points to as we move into its the interest rate environment thats most negatively impacting our returns outlook and its why were shifting our revenue mix towards noninterest income accelerating our capital allocation people and investment towards asia and investing in a multiyear technology plan to significantly improve productivity turning to slide on the fourth quarter it was a solid set of results with reported pretax profits of billion adjusted revenues were down on last years fourth quarter mainly driven by the progressive impact of ultra low interest rates expected credit losses were basis points or billion in the quarter this compares to basis points or just under million in the fourth quarter of last year total ecls for the full year were billion at the lower end of our targeted billion to billion fullyear range while operating costs were up q4onq4 by ex the bank levy this was mainly driven by a decision to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 increase the variable pay pool accrual in the quarter which was down yearonyear and tangible net asset value per share increased by in the quarter to as you model please note that the weakening of the us dollar towards the end of will materially impact both costs and revenues if you adjusted our results to average january exchange rates it would have added billion to our revenues and billion to our operating costs turning to slide and looking at fourth quarter adjusted revenues across the three global businesses in wealth and personal banking revenues were down on a year ago with retail banking revenues falling by just under billion this was due largely to the impact of falling interest rates on deposit margins wealth management revenues were down million due to a combination of lower insurance sales and the impact of lower interest rates on private banking deposits commercial banking revenues were lower due mainly to the impact of lower margins on global liquidity and cash management in global banking and markets revenues were down and thats despite another good quarter of global markets which saw revenues up even as we kept value at risk broadly stable on slide net interest income was billion thats up against the third quarter the net interest margin was basis points up basis points on the third quarter reflecting improved liability margins particularly in the us and europe as we look forward while we expect a soft start for noninterest income for net interest income due to the lower shortterm hibor rates and fewer days this quarter we expect nim stabilization and lending volume growth to progressively support net interest income over the remainder of the year on the next slide two core trends to discuss firstly on fee income we saw greater stability in the fourth quarter notably in commercial banking and global banking and markets with a small reduction in fees in wealth and personal banking reflecting lower insurance sales and unsecured lending volumes and secondly on other non interest income it was down million this reflected a combination of lower interest earned on securities held in the trading book a reduction in the value of new business written in insurance and lower credit and funding valuation adjustments in global banking and markets for we expect customer activity and fee income to recover as economic activity recovers and weve seen a good start to the year in hong kong but with the impact of new covid19 variants this recovery may be slower than we foresaw a few months ago in areas such as consumer credit we also expect global markets to have trading activity lower than we experienced last year on the next slide ecls were billion or basis points of gross loans in the quarter relative to the third quarter this mainly reflects higher stage charges and the fact that the third quarter benefited from additional releases the stage and pl charge for was around billion including around million incurred in the fourth quarter we now have stage and stage provision balances of billion thats up billion in while we remain cautious on the outlook for credit in we expect the ecl charge to be lower than and weve now updated at this point to the guidance we gave you at third quarter effectively a range of approximately basis points to basis points this year by we expect ecls to have materially reduced from the basis point charge in towards or even below the lower end of our basis point to basis point normalized range turning to slide fourth quarter adjusted operating costs ex the bank levy were million higher than the third quarter this was driven by targeted technology investment and marketing spend together with a decision to increase the variable pay pool for the year as a whole operating costs were down billion or this hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 included a number of offsetting items the variable pay pool was down by more than million covid19 impacted cost items like travel and entertainment and marketing were down by around million and our combined cost programs over and delivered inyear savings of billion offsetting this were various items including increased technology investment up million or on for we expect the bank levy to fall to around million thats some million lower than for operating costs ex the bank levy were seeking to keep them broadly flat after adjusting for the impact of dollar weakness with significant cost savings from our ongoing restructuring program offset by a combination of certain costs increasing from covid19 lows together with planned higher investment and growth spend on slide in the first year of our threeyear program we achieved billion of gross riskweighted asset saves with more than halfway towards our billion gross reduction target of low returning riskweighted assets this included a billion reduction in the fourth quarter we expect to make around a further billion of gross rwa sales in on slide our core tier ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was thats up basis points in the quarter this was driven by a combination of rwa reductions on a constant currency basis profit generation fx translation differences and basis points of software intangible benefit on the latter we expect software intangibles to be reversed out of our core tier over the next to months excluding fx movements riskweighted assets fell by billion in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of reducing lending balances the planned interim dividend of resulted on a reduction of basis points to our core tier ratio at the end of and with that back to noel noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks ewen so last february we announced series of actions to make hsbc fit for the future and we remain committed to delivering them but there were three fundamental shifts in that we must reflect in our plans for the future first the interest rate environment changed dramatically we lost around billion of net interest income or more than percentage points of rote and we dont expect rates to rebound anytime soon we reacted to this in two ways by accelerating our shift towards noninterest income including earned fee income and cutting our costs further and faster to compensate for lost revenue second the shift to digital was accelerated by the impact of lockdown as the pandemic took hold our customers digital engagement increased dramatically we were already investing heavily in digital and technology so we responded by rapidly accelerating the digitization of our business third covid19 has made everyone aware of how fragile the global economy is to an external event and as a consequence environmental issues have taken on a renewed importance thankfully we were already working on the next phase of our successful journey with respect to sustainability and we announced an ambitious new climate plan in october of last year the low carbon transition is the most transformative trend of our time and it presents an unmissable commercial opportunity for a bank of our size geography and profile so these three trends and the decisive action we took to meet them form the basis for much of what youre going to hear over the next minutes we have a plan that we think can deliver at least return on tangible equity over the medium term it will transfer material amounts of capital from low return markets to higher return markets hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 that capital will be deployed into businesses in asia where we already have a strong track record of growth and profitability and we will also invest in technology to transform our costs its a plan capable of delivering returns above the cost of capital and supporting both sustainable dividends and future growth it is built on the four pillars you see here on slide and ill take you through each one in turn slide looks at the first pillar of our plan driving growth by focusing on our strengths were going to stop trying to be everything to everyone we want to do the things that capitalize on the advantages we have and to do them brilliantly in wealth and personal banking we will continue to invest in our scale markets in the uk and hong kong but the new story here is asia wealth nuno will talk about this in more detail but were going to invest more than billion in wealth in asia in the next five years to achieve three things we want to serve high net worth and ultrahigh net worth clients in hong kong mainland china singapore and southeast asia globally we want to build out our insurance and asset management capabilities across asia with organic and inorganic options firmly on the table and we want to do more with clients who already bank with us bringing wealth opportunities to our customers in commercial banking and global banking and markets in commercial banking we will continue to be unashamedly and uniquely global we want to lead the world in crossborder trade and in serving midmarket corporates globally there are many things that are changing with respect to our strategy and our execution but this one will remain unchanged well invest around billion to drive customer acquisition to become a digital leader in upscale markets and to support the three critical product platforms global liquidity and cash management global trade and receivables finance and foreign exchange global banking and markets will retain the capacity to serve clients globally but well invest in the markets that set us apart whilst also moving the heart of the business to asia including leadership we will use our global network to connect our global banking and markets clients to opportunities in asia the uk and the middle east where we can add the greatest value well spend around million in gbm in asia to build better digital market platforms to support our wealth strategy to build better market access and execution capabilities for our wholesale clients and to expand our investment banking coverage across asia peter will talk about this in a few minutes slide shows where our us and european business is fitting michael roberts and the us team did a great job in repositioning the business closing branches driving down costs and reducing capital for the next stage we will focus the vast majority of our resources into our international corporate and institutional franchise in the us well continue to connect our us wholesale clients into our international network driving revenue growth in other regions well also defend our strength in us dollar clearing trade and foreign exchange and continue to reposition us markets and security services to provide access in a way that uses less capital in us retail our focus will be on building an international wealth platform that connects wpb clients across our global network to us wealth opportunities and we continue to explore organic and inorganic options for our us retail banking franchise for europe the story is similar nuno and the team laid solid foundations in removing rwas and reducing ftes by our strategy remains focused on connecting inbound and outbound international wholesale customers into our network and our wealth business is focused on our global booking centers in mainland europe well keep investing in our transaction banking franchises to better connect issuers and investors into europe in europe to asia and continue to reduce or access subscale retail banking and sme portfolios we are continuing with the strategic review of our retail banking operations in france and are in negotiations in relation to a potential sale although no decision has yet been taken if any sale is implemented given the underlying performance of the french retail business a loss on sale is expected hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 slide looks at the second pillar of our plan and this is incredibly important we see our digital agenda as presenting opportunities for both revenue growth and cost efficiency in the last year we spent around billion on digital and technology the impact of this is coming through our digital engagement and ratings in our revenue in our cost base and in our ability to operate a global business in the middle of covid we wouldnt have achieved what we have already done without that historical investment john will go into more detail about the future investment program but i want to take a minute or two to talk about how well pay for it we think we need to grow investment by between and on a compound annual basis between and to pay for that we need to reduce the cost of running hsbc by to over the same period we intend to save billion more on costs than we said last february on a constant currency basis well make our cost programs work harder to deliver between billion and billion of savings and well spend around billion to achieve those savings with at least half of that falling in we also intend to keep our headline costs broadly stable from onwards enabling us to reinvest further savings into the business slide is about energizing hsbc for growth so the culture the composition and the future skills we need this is about creating a dynamic inclusive and entrepreneurial organization weve already infused the top of the firm with new people and new skills more than threequarters of my senior leadership team have been in post for around a year or less and of the layer below just under half of the top took off their current roles in weve also reduced senior management numbers by removing layers and increasing accountability im passionate about creating an inclusive organization that unlocks opportunity for all and fosters the diversity of thought and experience that every business needs the diversity of our top team is improving but we want to go further both in terms of gender and ethnicity we also made good progress improving employee advocacy but there are gaps amongst some employee groups that we must bridge we also need to build skills and capabilities in areas that are different to what weve needed historically particularly in digital analytics and sustainability we can bring some of those in from our side as we have done over the last months but we also need to train from within which were doing through the newly expanded hsbc university for which i was the executive sponsor before i became group ceo slide looks at one of our biggest opportunities and one of our biggest drivers of change the transition to net zero were already a global leader in sustainability and we want to stay there as the market expands exponentially in we were the biggest underwriter of green social sustainability and sustainability linked bonds for the second year running doubling the volume we underwrote in weve already set out some uniquely ambitious plans for a bank of our scale and footprint to reduce emissions in our operations and supply chain to net zero by and to align our portfolio of financed emissions to net zero by or sooner in may we intend to file a resolution to our agm requesting investor approval for a clear sciencebased route to a net zero aligned portfolio it will commit the ban to ending financing of coalfired power it will align our financed emissions to net zero and it will commit us to evidence in it through very specific milestones and reporting let me be clear that we intend and plan to work with all our clients in every sector to map and finance their low carbon transition we are aligning every part of our business behind that aim both to achieve our net zero ambition and to capture the commercial opportunity so taking all of this in aggregate what does tomorrows hsbc look like were effectively undertaking three pivots to asia to wealth and fee income well also continue to grow our global capability in wholesale banking hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 and further leverage our unique capability to service midmarket corporates globally these are our highest return highest growth opportunities we expect to move around percentage points of group tangible equity to asia over the medium to long term and were linking this to compensation for the first time it will explicitly be part of mine and ewens scorecards we also expect to move around percentage points of tangible equity to wealth and personal banking over the same period with a broadly equivalent reduction in global banking and markets the focused investment in wealth combined with our investment in technology aims to deliver compound annual revenue growth in the mid single digits from that should accelerate the growth of fee income and insurance income from to around of group revenue over the medium to long term this is an ambitious plan but a deliverable plan and were going to move with pace and determination and belief in our ability to get it done ill now hand over to peter to talk about our asia opportunity nuno to talk about our pivot to wealth and john to talk about the technology that underpins everything we want to achieve peter wong tung shun deputy chairman and chief executivethe hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited hsbc holdings plc thank you noel i want to start by saying im very excited about asias growth and hsbc is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunities economically asia is outperforming the rest of the world it contributed of global growth in and is expected to account for almost half of global gdp by the key story in asia is rapid wealth creation by twothirds of the worlds middle class will be in asia up from just over today driving strong growth in consumer spending and this would promote trade pwc forecasts that trade flows in asia will grow faster than the rest of the world over the next five years for hsbc the opportunities lie not just in helping sustainable growth supporting trade and managing the wealth within the region but also in using our unique global footprint that connect the rest of the world to asia and vice versa we are already a leader in asia we operate in markets across the region covering of asias gdp for the majority of our markets our history goes back to years therefore we know the customers the cultures we know the regulators and we know the business flows and when it comes to global connectivity our international competitors lack our footprint and deep connection to asia and our asian competitors lack our international network within asia hong kong mainland china southeast asia and india will drive our growth these markets will benefit from an expected doubling of assets under management in asia with trillion over the next five years to expand our businesses we will continue to strengthen our position in hong kong our marketleading digital product in particular and leverage our strength to capitalize on the opportunities in the greater bay area a region with a population of million and gdp of trillion we will hire more than wealth managers in china where we expect the middle class population to double from the current million to million by in singapore in our wealth and personal banking business we will increase resources to build on the momentum created by last year doubledigit aum growth across premier and jade and establish regional wealth management hub for asean and south asia our global banking and markets and commercial banking businesses will capitalize on the more than multinational corporations that have regional headquarters in singapore we already bank some of these and we will build on this progress by scaling up our coverage teams and product capabilities including cash liquidity risk management to increase our market share in the space hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 in india we will build on our longstanding national and international relationships we accelerate the growth momentum we have already established also banking revenue grew by over per annum in the last two years and we also aim to leverage our unrivaled network to win a larger share of the ph million nonresident indian wealth management business across the world so how are we going to do this we will invest an additional billion in the region over the next five years with half of it in south and southeast asia the investment is mainly in new talent for our wealth management and wholesale banking businesses and improving our technology externally we will enhance our digital capabilities across all markets to deliver a tailored endtoend customer experience enabling our million clients who use our network to move or invest their capital globally and seamlessly internally we will invest in areas including data and analytics powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning to anticipate the needs of our customers more effectively and capture a greater share of wallet across retail commercial and global banking and we will continue to maximize the revenuegenerating potential of our global footprint and product range already of our global revenue is driven by crossborder businesses in the last months we have won awards for best global trade finance bank best digital bank and best regional private bank among many others we will continue to invest to capitalize on the huge and growing opportunities in asias wealth market and work towards becoming asias leading international wholesale bank overall these actions will increase market share and boost our revenue streams which will generate doubledigit pbt growth in asia over the medium to long term allowing the region to continue to deliver significant contributions to hsbc group dividend this is really an exciting time to be in asia and really an exciting time to be in hsbc and with that ill hand over to nuno thank you nuno a matos chief executive wealth and personal banking hsbc holdings plc thank you peter last year we created wealth and personal banking and we brought together our massaffluent asset management insurance and private banking businesses into one integrated business allowing for a significant acceleration of our wealth strategy last year this business generated close to billion in high liquidity wealth revenues with more than being fee revenue our wealth expansion is well underway weve made the necessary structural changes the plans are well defined we have bold but achievable ambitions and we are in full execution mode particularly in asia but also in our global wealth hubs and thats what i would like to talk about today we believe that wealth management is one of the most compelling opportunities for growth in financial services today the affluent and high net worth population expansion lower rates for longer and the capitallight profile of this business makes it very attractive and while the opportunities are global asia is no doubt the fastestgrowing region for wealth assets in this context hsbc is perfectly placed to capture this opportunity we have a compelling starting point with million customers and trillion of wealth balances making us a leading international wealth manager the lions share is in asia accounting for more than of our wealth revenues we are the second largest wealth manager in asia leveraging the strength of our brand which is built on a 155year heritage of serving customers and the full capabilities of a universal bank last year we grew our global wealth balances by more than billion a doubledigit growth hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 second as the wealth opportunity becomes truly global our international network gives us the ability to deliver transactional banking and wealth management services in the most relevant markets to our internationaloriented affluent and high net worth customers we have a strong presence in the worlds top eight crossborder wealth hubs and third we have unique access to our prospect customers through our leading cmb and gbm businesses and their extensive client base in more than of net new money from asset management and private banking came from our wholesale relationships so over the next three to five years we will invest more than billion to leverage these advantages and accelerate development of our wealth business particularly in asia our investments will be focused on two areas firstly developing new products technology and platforms to deliver a leading client experience we will build digitallyenabled financial planning platforms across the client continuum and scale up our insurance health and wellness platforms we will integrate our wealth management capabilities with a mobilefirst approach and create a single core banking platform for private banking across asia and emea we will differentiate our asset management business with a focus on highvalue higher margin products and well deliver high conviction products in areas like alternatives esg and equities well deliver bespoke wealth products for our jade and private banking customers in partnership with global banking and markets and well grow and deepen ultrahigh net worth clients through a dedicated client coverage model focusing on asia and the middle east and on products which make best use of groups capabilities in parallel twothirds of our investments will aim to significantly expand our distribution capabilities these efforts will focus on hiring more than customerfacing wealth planners equipped with remote digital capabilities particularly for our flagship pinnacle expansion in mainland china and high network coverage in singapore on significantly growing our private banking reach on mainland china to cities and more than doubling our jade customer base in mainland china and singapore and finally in expanding our asset management footprint in emerging asia particularly india and malaysia these investments will enable us to grow our aums in asia faster than the markets and grow revenues by more than cagr significantly increasing the contribution of wealth to our total wpb revenueswe have strong credentials to deliver on this ambition our leadership position in hong kong is well known having delivered strong growth over the last five years and consolidating our number one wealth market share our uk integrated digital wealth capabilities are now very credible with recent rollouts of flexinvest well and benefits today more than of our customers equity trading in hong kong is now done in mobile we will be leveraging these capabilities to differentiate our wealth proposition in the rest of asia in mainland china we are the largest foreign bank and despite the challenge of the pandemic we have launched pinnacle in four cities and obtained the first ever foreign fintech license in mainland china our hiring plans are well underway in six months we have approximately wealth planners and we will scale up to by and by the way we are also exceeding our financial targets our rollout of a leading adviceled private banking in mainland china will also benefit from our private banking in hong kong which was recently voted number one for the sixth consecutive year and in asset management we will aim to take a majority stake in jintrust following changes in regulation and we will execute to become a top international asset management in mainland china hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 finally our global footprint is unique and particularly important in the wealth space as our client needs increasingly are global with material expansion in many wealth corridors we will invest in our booking centers in singapore switzerland the uk channel islands and the us as key wealth hubs in india we will target to be the number one foreign bank for nris and having already the leading market share among the overseas chinese diaspora as asians wealth expands cross border we are well positioned to grow with it i have great confidence in the prospects of our wealth business the combination of our unique competitive position our integrated business structure and our investment in people and platforms will deliver solid growth with our global and asian position wpb is well placed and organized to accelerate our wealth growth and deliver at pace and i look forward to updating you on our progress i will now hand over to john john m hinshaw group chief operating officer hsbc holdings plc thanks nuno i want to expand upon what youve heard today and describe how technology will be a differentiator for the group our focus is to shift away from costs across the bank that arent adding value to customers and to make investments that drive revenue growth and a better customer experience but first let me explain digital business services you probably knew it as host in the past which stood for hsbc operations services and technology its my view that this was a fragmented approach to our task at hand which is digitizing our business endtoend ph thus we are digital were focused on improving our business results and were a servicesbased organization digital business services the first slide explains our approach you probably wont be surprised that we spent more on technology especially given increased customer demand due to covid but more importantly the amount were spending is that were developing technology in a fundamentally different way our approach to building technology platforms has shifted from building bespoke local solutions to leveraging our scale we will build once and deploy globally were also laser focused on reducing the banks cost by digitizing endtoend processes and eliminating manual work to do this were dissolving the boundaries between the front middle and back offices so work is processed with the limited or ideally no manual touch points in for example we processed billion payments as a bank and they were worth trillion and we increased our no touch rate on those transactions to but we can do even better our aim is to get above no touch rate in the next several years and to get those last few percentage points were going to need to digitize the most complex payment processes reducing the number of people involved in manual work means they can be redeployed into revenuegenerating roles and savings can be reinvested back into technology creating a virtuous circle of digitization that unlocks customer growth were also doubling down on our partnerships with big tech firms like google and apple amazon microsoft and alibaba as well as many small fintech firms across the globe for example we believe hsbc is one of google clouds largest and most engaged financial services clients and were working with them on intelligenceled financial crime detection which will ultimately help protect our revenues the next slide contains three examples of how were using our scale to improve the customer experience and drive revenue growth weve invested over billion in the last few years on our mobile x platform which is now a bank in your pocket and it standardizes our core digital platform across all key markets but one of the most interesting things about this new platform is the way its driving personalized interactions we marketed it extensively in hong kong last year and saw record credit card spending as customers liked the improved hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 experience weve also received app store ratings in many markets that are or higher which is up significantly from prior ratings we now have million hong kong digital customers which represent of the population and over of all retail transactions in hong kong are done digitally our global money account platform is a great example of how were taking something developed in one country in this case the us and deploying it elsewhere the internationally mobile population requires access to funds in different countries and currencies im personally a great example of that having just recently moved from the us to the uk and our product does just that it enables instant global transfers with our multicurrency card using real time fx rates built on a common platform its now being rolled out worldwide it went live in the us in august with planned launches this year in the uk for expats in the middle east and singapore and shortly the rest of the world will follow and then finally kinetic which is a cloudbased mobile app for our corporate customers that we rolled out in the uk and were using the insights gained so far to see how we can apply the capabilities in asia and other parts of the world finally lets get into more details on the opportunities to drive operational efficiencies clearly covid has transformed the way weve all worked over the past year and we now have an opportunity to create a lower sustained cost base in both corporate real estate and reduced business travel weve analyzed our worldwide real estate footprint and anticipate a reduction in the order of over the next several years while also ensuring our remaining real estate has a lower environmental footprint on the journey to having our operations at net zero by therere also opportunities to further reduce our workforce performing noncustomerfacing functions overall our workforce numbers are down yearonyear despite the fact that we paused redundancies last year while we assess the impact of the pandemic on our customers and our people but over the next few years through digitizations we expect the finance function to be reduced by about a third and we will change the nature of the work the finance teams perform well do this by migrating our analytics and reporting capability to an agile cloud platform our technology head count will be optimized to focus on agile development and we will reskill our colleagues with the technology skills needed for the future theres also an opportunity to materially shrink the number of manual processes which will result in less need for the vast operations function in our bank today which currently spans resources many of these resources will be reskilled for higher value customer engaged opportunities including data and analytics skills that are in high demand our commitment throughout hsbc is to attract and retain the best and brightest and most diverse colleagues for our journey ahead few if any other organizations in the world can offer the same breadth of opportunities that hsbc does to apply cutting edge technology to solve real life problems and improve peoples lives were doubling down on creating a diverse and inclusive workforce i have an entirely new senior management team that has half promoted from within half recruited externally and has threequarter female executives we will continue to do more to improve gender balance and diversity across the broader team thanks for listening let me hand back over to ewen now ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks john on slide our refresh plan seeks to build returns that at or above the cost of capital and to do so in an environment where rate broadly stay at todays levels providing leverage upside of higher rates return in the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 coming years in order to do this theres broadly three buckets of return upside firstly things that we just expect to happen irrespective of management intervention into this bucket ill put two things the normalization of ecl charges that i talked about earlier and the lowering of the bank levy from this year onwards together they should have around basis points of rote over the next few years secondly the actions we talked about across revenues costs and capital together we think these plans can drive an incremental basis points of return on tangible equity over the coming years on revenues a few things that contribute to this firstly the achievement of a better mix of higher returning lending relationships this was a core part of what we announced in february last year the shifting of capital from certain lower returning western clients to the east we made very good progress on the shift out of the west in with material growth riskweighted asset reductions in our us and nonringfenced bank franchises but covid19 did slow the reallocation of capital to the east relative to what we expected to do last year however as peter has just set out we continue to be massive ph bulls on the high growth and return potential across our asian franchises over the medium term we have an ambition to have asia represent around of our tangible equity thats up from today with much of the remaining of our capital led to asia and secondly on revenues is our planned growth in noninterest income youve heard from peter or nuno our raised aspirations in this respect we see significant growth opportunities in both asia wealth and asia wholesale and were committing further material capital people technology and investment resources to underpin this on operating costs youve heard today an increased ambition from us weve raised our cost reduction target by a further billion but more importantly weve got growing confidence in a multiyear cost opportunity beyond those and an aspiration to keep costs broadly flat while continuing to achieve healthy revenue growth and jaws john just talked about this using technology to transform the whole of our organization lower front office distribution costs through increased digital delivery and higher relationship manager productivity lower commercial real estate costs as we return to work in a very different way and using technology to transform the operations and functional support model delivering much better customer and controlled outcomes at a dramatically lower cost and on capital weve got a whole bunch of initiatives underway stripping back the capital allocation to our us and nonringfenced bank franchises including trapped capital currently sitting in the us improving the optimization of capital across various subsidiaries elsewhere and investing in our stress testing capabilities to drive down the aggregate level of stress across the group thats why were now guiding to a to core tier ratio rather than the previous to and the last building block for our return on tangible equity is an improved rate environment to be clear were not baking this into our base plans we want to have a business that can generate cost of equity returns assuming this rate environment but i would note that a 100basispoint parallel shift upwards in rates would improve our returns by around basis points within two years so on slide and to conclude before handing back to noel were resetting our operating cost target for billion lower than previously guided and post an ambition to keep costs broadly stable while achieving material revenue growth our gross riskweighted asset target by the end of remains unchanged at least billion but with over billion achieved in and a further billion targeted in we have high confidence in delivery our core tier ratio of or more with confidence in being able to manage to a to range over the medium term a new dividend policy all cash going forward with no scrip alternative of dividend of for hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 and then transitioning in towards a payout ratio of to from onwards this allows for a powerful combination of both sustainable growth and sustainable dividends where we have excess capital in any given year we will look to buybacks to augment dividends but please dont model buybacks into your numbers and a return on tangible equity of at least over the medium term a return that can be delivered in the current rate environment with material leverage upside if rates improve and a return that can be delivered with a set of actions that sit firmly as selfhelp measures within this management teams control and with that thanks and over to noel to conclude noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks ewen so to wrap up we will significantly increase the groups capital and resource allocation to faster growing higher return markets we will capitalize on the opportunity offered by our network and our franchise to drive growth from fee generation products in wealth and platform businesses in wholesale banking we will leverage technology to transform our cost position offering significantly higher operating leverage and freeing up resources for investment and we expect all this to deliver returns above the cost of capital while driving revenue growth principally from asia through our new dividend policy we aim to deliver both sustainable dividends and sustainable growth and as a final comment in we executed against all promises and in we will do the same we will get it done with that wed be happy to take your questions unverified participant thanks noel and good morning good afternoon everybody we got a combination of questions mainly audio questions from telephone lines but also some written questions from the video webcast well start off with four or five from the audio lines so over to sean the operator please hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of martin leitgeb from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning and thank you very much for the presentation the first question is just on capital im just trying to understand the moving parts in terms of capital progression from here because on one hand the very strong capital trend this quarter so and the guidance in terms of capital headwind so basel iii and software intangibles so that still implies just around i mean if we were just to ph parsify basel iii for an around billion to billion excess capital spot versus your to target range and just trying to square it up with your mixed singledigit asset growth ambitions your investment spend which is over a fiveyear period i understand and the dividend payout guidance not capturing is it right to a significant headroom here in terms of capital whether that could mean either faster growth whether thats organically or inorganically or is there anything im missing in terms of the potential headwind and the second question i was just wondering on rate sensitivity and thank you for the disclosure on slide with a parallel shift in yield curve could you help us quantify the impact from purely arising from a steepening of the yield curve that we have seen obviously over the last couple of weeks months in us dollar but also in sterling is there fairly a limited impact arising from this steepening of the yield curve given limited ph hedges in particular in hong kong or is there any more meaningful impact coming thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay well look ill start off in the first question martin on yeah maybe to deal with it through riskweighted assets i mean if you we obviously finished the year at just over billion of riskweighted assets yeah we are telegraphing an expectation of loan growth in sort of midsingle digits over the next few years so i think for this year its probably going to be backend weighted as various economies recover from covid we have around billion of regulatory pressures this year and yeah in total about billion to billion if you go through including the impact of basel weve got an rwa rundown program thats still got billion to go that largely offsets that billion this year and call another billion next year and then on top of that which has surprised us but yeah we had meaningful credit rating migration during there was about billion of credit migration were anticipating that to be less in it could be materially less depending on how economies recover and then a decent amount of that reverse out in onwards so when you put all that together we are anticipating riskweighted asset growth on distributions we do expect to be above the to payout ratio in and then migrating within that payout ratio thereafter as i said no buybacks this year but its certainly something that we used in the past as you know we do see them as a legitimate means of capital management and if we have excess capital in and beyond its certainly something well consider and on rate sensitivity yeah the steepening of the yield curve in the us dollar provides some support but not material support were far more sensitive to the near end of the curve hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc next question from the audio lines please martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of adrian cighi from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse okay thank you very much for taking my questions i have two questions one followup on capital and one on net interest income on capital just to understand youve very helpfully outlined the riskweighted asset bridge but is there in your capital target any sort of part of that surplus capital as it were earmarked for potential opportunities and could you maybe outline how much youre thinking and over what period of time and then on net interest income youve had a nim contribution of basis points from the liabilities side can you give us any insight how much of that is sort of recurring and how much more you could do from either changing liability mix or repricing going forward and then on loan volumes youve sort of shown a decline on quarteronquarter basis from the developments despite a weaker us dollar yet you expect a midsingle digit going forward sort of where do you expect this to come from thank you very much ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes on capital were not allocating or precisely allocating any amount to inorganic but within that dividend policy of the to payout ratio we are giving ourselves some flexibility to do bolton acquisitions and i use the word bolton quite carefully so dont expect us going out and doing material ma any time soon but if we see things that we can bolt on that accelerate our strategy and that some of the areas we talked about today well certainly consider it on net interest income nim generally i think q4 there was the repayment of the ant ipo in hong kong which i think had a material impact on lending volumes together with our traditional cramming down of corporate borrowings towards yearend so i wouldnt read too much into q4 of last year on net interest income for this year we do expect on the positive side some asset growth as i said a bias to the second half i think the news flow out of the uk yesterday was very positive vaccination program has now started in hong kong youll have your own forecast for china but we see significant growth opportunity i think in asia coming out of the covid and continue to see a significant opportunity here in the uk mortgages for example where weve been consistently running at about a market share during the year last year on both the liabilities side and the assets side we see some repricing opportunity dollar weakness should add about million or so to noninterest income this year and offsetting that obviously when you look at our roll hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 forward interest tables were going to have some headwinds from the lower interest rates from last year and we currently got a very weak hibor so and you know that were very very sensitive to one threemonth hibor so noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc adrian id also add on loan volumes i think what we saw towards the end of last year particularly in asia was a lot of customers wholesale customers positioning themselves with facilities available to fund future growth but not yet drawing down on those facilities so i think theyre ready with their balance sheets to take advantage of an upturn and theyre waiting to see that upturn come as we start to see the world come out of the covid crisis hopefully on the back of the vaccination program but there was certainly a lot of activity towards the end of last year on getting ready for that upturn adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse thats very helpful thank you very much richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc another question from the audios please operator thank you your next question comes from tom rayner from numis please go ahead your line is open tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes good morning everybody a couple please first one on the impairment guidance for either at the bottom end or below the basis point to basis point range can i ask if youre factoring in anything significant in terms of the releases from the stage and reserves so whether that sort of number is going to be representative of sort of through the cycle rate and ive got a second question please just on sort of distributions you mentioned obviously share buybacks are a possibility but in the medium term i noticed that the medium term you define as three to four years so just wondering whether youre effectively ruling out buybacks for both this year and next year or whether thats reading too much into the terminology and im assuming that over and above the maximum dividend payout it will be the to target range on equity tier that sort of calibrates your maximum distribution potential thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks tom for picking me up on the use of the term medium so ill be more careful going forward no weve only ruled out buybacks in so i wasnt intending to also put a block on us participating in buybacks in on impairment guidance weve talked in the past about a normalized range of basis points to basis points through the cycle we were obviously more than double the top end of that in included in that was a very significant buildup of stage and stage if you back that out we were running in probably the low in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 as we think about there may well be some reserve releases in that guidance but i do think if the world is recovering out of covid we should be able to operate at or below basis points for onwards for a few years until the cycle turns again tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay thank you and just on the other question thanks for the clarification on the the total distributions i know youre leaving room for some bolton acquisitions you said in your maximum payout im just thinking if there arent any acquisition opportunities at all would you be prepared to distribute everything else that kept you within the to the target range ph on your core equity tier noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so the important thing is the first call on any excess capital will be to try and use it to drive growth but profitable growth in our strategically important markets in a focused way and then if we dont see opportunity for growth then we do reserve the option of buybacks but i think its too early to make that call at this point in time so i think we will clearly look to use the capital in profitable growth in the focused areas and resort to buybacks if we dont have a realistic opportunity for profitable deployment ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah and also remember tom and what i was talking about in one of the previous questions is yeah there will not be there will still be some decent amount of rwa inflation in both and coming from regulatory change noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think the important change weve made with this dividend policy is to provide an opportunity to both generate strong return and strong growth for the bank and thats what we try to position with the dividend policy going forward tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay thank you very much richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc one more audio question please and well take a couple of written questions thanks operator thank you your next question comes from the line of aman rakkar from barclays please go ahead your line is open aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning gents thanks for the questions so just a couple please can i just confirm quickly on the cost targets that youve given in does it include anything for french retail and the north american retail hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 business thats currently under review or should we be looking to kind of adjust those targets incrementally for anything that may or may not get announced noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thats not included within our cost targets any actions on those two areas would be incremental aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd okay noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc so therell be a loss of revenue as well so you need to take both of those into account aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd okay cool ph can i just ask then on cost management more broadly then i mean how are we thinking about the cost managing that cost base i mean are you looking to target jaws as well as given the kind of absolute cost target if the revenue environment doesnt come through are you looking to manage it on a jaws basis should we be looking at costincome ratios i mean how are you thinking about cost flex if the revenues dont come through noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ill give you a couple of comments first and then ill ask ewen to go into more detail but were targeting an absolute cost number in the medium term and on a constant currency basis that is now billion when we talked a year ago we talked about billion in were now talking billion on a constant currency basis in the medium term but that is also having taken into account a willingness to invest so that billion is post investment and clearly were investing in the business because we see growth opportunities and we believe its right for the bank to invest in those growth opportunities now clearly thats a dynamic we have to keep under watch as to how much growth is starting to return into the economy and how much growth we should be investing in but that target absolute number weve given you is on the assumption of growth and on the assumption of investing in growth and in total around about billion over the next five years in asia but ewen do you want to add any more ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean i actually think weve done a pretty good job on cost save in the last couple of years remember in we grew our cost base by about in that year last year we shrank it by thats a percentage point delta in the cost run rate as noel said i mean i think it really were not targeting either jaws or what were targeting is to get returns up materially and in order to do that we need to control costs well john talked about earlier growing confidence internally about a very material productivity uplift that we can get from the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 investment in technology and that gets you on a very virtuous circle the more productivity you drive the more affordability you have to invest but i mean also i think over the last couple of years what youve also seen is weve been flexible if wed seen growth come down revenue projections come down weve adjusted our cost trajectory so we think we have got a decent amount of growth ahead of us and we think the cost plans that we set out are realistic for that cost for that revenue trajectory but if things change well change our cost plan noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and the other important thing when you look at the slides youll notice there below the number in absolute terms remains the same from onwards at about billion on a constant currency basis billion on an fx adjusted basis the nature of that cost changes so youre seeing a higher proportion of that cost base going into investment and technology thats the red part of that bar chart and youre seeing the bau run costs the operating costs become a smaller percentage of that total cost base and that for me is where we then start to get the payback in terms of return on capital because were deploying more of our investment into taking out bad costs investing in the good cost that can drive revenue and drive enhanced customer experience and thats the balancing act that were trying to achieve aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd okay thank you very much richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc a couple of questions from ronit ghose from citigroup first one is on the wealth business the wealth business in hong kong is up and obviously doing very strong why do you think your wealth business in asia excluding hong kong has been less strong and what should we do incrementally about it noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think its a great question and to be honest i dont think weve invested enough outside of hong kong and outside of china in the past and thats why over the next three to five years were embarking upon a material investment program of which will be deployed outside of hong kong and china so thats an important aspect of why we think we can succeed the other thing id say on success is were investing on a platform that is already very very successful in hong kong so weve taken the learnings from there and taken them elsewhere and weve taken the clients that weve fostered in asia in our commercial banking and global banking business and were working and were taking those clients into our wealth business so were investing on an already successful platform just to give you some statistics from of the private banking net new money that came into the private bank last year came from our wholesale banking relationships commercial banking and global banking and of the net new money from our asset management business last year came from those same very those same sources commercial banking and global banking hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 now across asia including south and southeast asia we have a very successful commercial and global banking business which were also investing in and we see that as a source of growth for our wealth business as we put resources on the ground and as we enhance our product capability in wealth in asset management and insurance so thats why i think we can drive growth at a faster rate than we have done historically richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc and the second question is more of a technical question again from ronit from citi given your strong capital position why youre not paying quarterly dividends this year please noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to pick up that ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look i mean i think a couple of reasons i mean firstly on our side just caution i mean i would note that we are coming out of a in a 100year recessionary event and were not out of it yet so were pretty pleased with how we managed our capital resources last year but we do see value in having strong capital ratios at the moment as we recover out of covid i think secondly also just from a regulatory perspective you would all know that the annual cyclical scenario didnt get run by the bank of england at the back end of last year were sort of in the middle of running that stress test at the moment and yeah i think the news coming out of the uk overnight was pretty positive around covid so were not expecting any surprises out of that but i think well take yeah well pay one interim dividend this year in the middle of the year if we can and then well revisit the approach to quarterly versus semiannual dividends next year richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay operator back to the audio lines for our two three questions please operator thank you your next question from the phone line comes from edward firth from kbw please go ahead your line is open edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah morning everybody thanks very much ewen i just had a quick question really on the targets and in particular indiscernible word you used but you said that if we were to redo our forecasts for the current exchange rate we should add about billion of costs for does the same go for revenue and im thinking obviously about consensus but obviously the revenue you mentioned was about billion higher it would have been if you had it at the current exchange rate so should we be thinking about that when were looking at our forecast for as well thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 yeah when we looked at consensus it was obviously hard for us to know whether or not a weakening dollar had been picked up we thought it probably hadnt in most peoples forecast that we published a few weeks ago but as i said if you would use average january exchange rate for last year revenues would have been billion higher and costs would have been billion higher so as you work your numbers i think you definitely have to think about the impact of the weak dollar it also impacts why were sticking with a billion cost target for which we think is billion higher than what it was previously and amongst that billion of revenue uplift its roughly half and half across noninterest income and net interest income edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay thank you so much richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc another question from the audio line please operator thank you your next question comes from manus costello from autonomous please go ahead your line is open manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hi everyone i wanted to ask a couple of questions on the commercial bank ph please if i look at this year you delivered a rote and if i normalize for provisions maybe you get that up to or ph and its the biggest consumer of rwas in the group divisionally and it will be the biggest consumer of tangible equity so whats constraining the commercial bank in terms of its rote and how are you planning to focus on that specifically and then also specifically on the commercial bank are you still planning to recycle the rwas out of us gbm and into us commercial and if so why would it not be better to think about a restructuring of that us commercial business and maybe adding that to your capital return plan thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc manus thank you firstly the commercial banking rote in was impacted by two things firstly the ifrs line provisions which youve drawn attention to and you would need to normalize for that and secondly the impact of lower interest rates on what is a very liquid balance sheet in commercial banking so it had a material impact on the revenue of commercial banking in now were looking to reposition that aspect of the revenue decline by a greater focus on fee income a greater focus on repricing some of the asset book and driving greater collaboration with some of the gbm and fee income product range which weve had a very successful track record of doing particularly in crossselling more capital market opportunities to cmb clients more trade generated fee income products to cmb clients and more ma activity as well we were particularly successful on that in the uk and in asia but its still early days on that transition into a low interest rate environment and rebooting other sources of revenue and fee income for commercial banking with respect to the commercial bank in the us actually precovid that was generating good returns both within the us and when you add in the crossborder referrals to other parts of the world the inherent return from our commercial banking clients in the us was strong so i dont think strategically that is an underperforming business hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 the way we have an underperforming business in retail banking in the us and its one that we think can continue to generate good returns going forward as the economies normalize after covid manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp thanks noel ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah manus maybe just one other thing to add yeah as you model it too i think customer activity was pretty muted in a number of areas so youll see in some of the fee income lines they were pretty depressed last year and again we would expect those to recover as activity recovers manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp got it okay thank you very much guys richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc one more from the audio line then we go to a couple written indiscernible in hong kong thanks operator thank you your next question comes from raul sinha from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning everyone thanks very much for taking my questions perhaps if i can start on the tangible equity allocation slide again im just trying to understand this percentage point shift per year that youre talking about to get to about asia over time long term what are the constraints to going faster than that do you think thats the sort of addressable market and obviously your franchise in asia looks very strong too is that the fastest you can go within the addressable market of asia or are there other constraints that we cant really think of right now which might be bringing maybe some conservatism in there and also does that assume the us is ph bold in terms of your sort of target mix of the businesses and ive got a second one on nim if thats okay noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc let me just clarify a couple of comments on the reallocation of tangible equity what we talked about was a reallocation of around about basis points essentially from west to east we also said there was a reallocation of tangible equity by business line as well and thats about basis point or percentage point shift out of global banking and markets utilizing that equity into other business lines such as wealth and commercial banking and those two things obviously overlap to a degree its coming from the west principally out of global banking and markets in the us and continental europe which are low return markets for us relative to the return opportunity in asia hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 so were in the process of as we said running down parts of our book in the us and europe and reinvesting those saved rwas into asia and thats got to be done in an orderly manner it cant be and weve made good progress on that are gross rwa savings in the first year alone so i think you should view it as were pulling the rwas out of a lower return business global banking and markets in lower return geographies europe and us and redeploying into asia in wealth and commercial banking and in global banking in asia raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc got it thank you the second one i guess was more on nim and ph im wondering if ewen wants to tackle this one i was just wondering if you think hbap nim has now stabilized it was only down basis points in the last quarter ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc well i mean as you know raul the hbap nim is very short dated in both the asset and liability side so both sides effectively repriced both on a one or threemonth basis and its highly dependent on the path of nearterm hibor which continues to be very volatile so i would be hesitant to say that weve reached the bottom i mean certainly so far this year hibor has been very very weak i think were more optimistic that there was some upside during the year but im not going to predict the path of hibor and say that were theres no further weakness in nim as a result in hbap raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc got it ewen but if i look at slide where youve got your hibor assumptions laid out i think youve got basis points on hibor up from basis points and then rising up ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah no no but ive noted its also been basis points so far in q1 so raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc great and i was just wondering whether other factors apart from hibor might be more at play here but it sounds like hibor is still the main driver ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hibor is still weve repriced most of the liabilities at this point theres probably some modest but the biggest driver of that nim will be the trajectory of hibor this year raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks so much richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 ive got a couple of written questions which ill read out ph well ill just say the return on equity reallocation is organic a couple of questions one from ph winston pang of manulife in hong kong how do we measure the success of your digital investments in terms of increased revenues costs or risk management what are the sort of mix if we should measure the success of your digital investments please noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think its a great question i think we need to do more on disclosure on the return we get in on those digital investments i mean we measure that internally we have every project tracked understanding the digital penetration rates the automation thats taking place but i think we should share more of that information with you as we go forward john is there anything youd like to add john m hinshaw a group chief operating officer hsbc holdings plc yeah a couple of thoughts i mean we have a technology strategy that spans the bank that is aligned with every single business objective both on the revenue side and the cost side and the risk management side i think your question ph winston asked about all three and there is a very extensive process and an ongoing process to tick and tie all of those so when you hear peter talk about growth in asia theres technology that underpins that when you hear nuno talk about the wealth program thats all connected to the technology objectives when you hear our cost targets there are specific technology objectives to take those costs out and we are investing a lot in operational resilience as well from the risk management perspective so as noel says we got all that internally happy to share that as appropriate in more detail ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean if i sort of look at what were doing in finance as an example yeah it really depends on the project and the metrics so were putting all of our reporting onto the cloud and creating a single data set as part of that over the next few years yeah weve done liquidity reporting over the last year or so were just starting on risk weighted assets in one of the markets at the moment yeah were processing times more data times faster so times improvement weve taken out a whole bunch of manual intervention so the control environment materially improved and we think when we finish their project well be able to take cost down and finance by a third but the main benefits are going to be much much better mi much better reporting and a much better control environment together with the significant uplift in productivity so were tracking all of the above on that project noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc let me give you a couple of facts just quickly but these are the sort of things we should probably share more regularly with you of our personal banking transactions globally are on a digital platform we had billion logins to our personal banking mobile apps in we had over million chat conversations with our personal banking customers last year online and we had nearly downloads of the hsbcnet corporate treasury mobile app which we recently developed and upgraded in that represented around about a improvement yearonyear on its utilization rates now theyre the sort of things that were tracking on how digital investment is transforming the way we do business but well come back to you and share more information on future updates hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i think the only thing to add to that the other side of it is also a very meaningful shift that obviously got accelerated last year in a reduction in traditional banking so cash transactions across the atms and branches were down last year contact center volumes and what we describe as traditional contact center conversations were down so one thing covid has done i think is dramatically shift away from some of the old economy stuff towards digital richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc second question from the written questions from yafei tian from citigroup in hong kong can you cite a bit better for us the opportunity in the pinnacle and wealth investments particularly in the greater bay area are we talking about hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars can you give us a bit of quantification there please noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc nuno do you want to pick up some of your thoughts its still early days on pinnacle but do you want to share some of the early results and what you see nuno a matos a chief executive wealth and personal banking hsbc holdings plc sure so in mainland china as we know we launched the pinnacle wealth venture we started with the first foreign fintech license in mainland china by the way in the first six months we hired wealth planners they are very well equipped and trained they are performing above expectations at this moment both in terms of the value of the business and ticket size we expect to scale up by by and cover cities and by the way this year we expect to scale up that number by another we believe we can do it and what i would like to call the attention is this is not just an insurance strategy this is a wealth strategy okay and thats the way we are actually growing in southeast asia in mainland china its a nonmass market nonbranchbased strategy its a digitalenabled strategy with personal wealth planners richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc is there anything that you can share with us on what you see as the opportunity for wealth in china for hsbc particularly in the greater bay area nuno a matos a chief executive wealth and personal banking hsbc holdings plc in february theres an mou signed between pboc cbirc between them and also with hong kong and macau what the mou is about is about mutual investment between the greater bay area and hong kong and that will have substantial potential for us the pinnacle project that were doing right now is actually also getting ready for that because when the investment when the mutual investment is pushed between the two is pushed between greater bay area and hong kong were the leading bank in hong kong with the quality products and were also the leading foreign bank in china and so the pinnacle will work very well with the strategy because they will be selling wealth planning in the greater bay area hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript

then reflect some loan growth as you suggested for later this year would it be fair to assume interestearning asset should be up quite meaningfully versus the q4 position at least in dollar terms perhaps of midsingle digit and then on the nim obviously it grew in q4 but you pointed to some headwinds from hibor et cetera if one was to assume midsingledigit reduction in nim from here given that interestearning asset balance growth it seemed to point to the uplift to consensus nii in just trying to get a sense as to whether that sounds reasonable or whether im being a bit too optimistic given where hibor is on sort of back end nature of the loan growth this year and then just a quick followup on rwas thank you very much for the disclosure on the billion to billion regulatory headwinds just wondering whether you might be able to break that down at all between frtb other basel iii components and other regulatory changes and is there anything sort of beyond we should be factoring in indiscernible anything sort of residual beyond that you would expect to be much less in magnitude thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so on indiscernible yes that will have an impact on us on the current modeling in about but its a long time away and we would expect to have done work on how would we mitigate some of that impact so i think ive given you all of the inputs out to i am not going to comment on the individual breakdown of all of that into a subcomponent part but on net interest income yeah relative to consensus i guess just two things id note one is i dont think consensus as it was modeled or as we disclosed included the impact of dollar weakness which we think would have added about million so i dont know where that was in your numbers and i think we are more optimistic as you would expect us to be but probably more optimistic than consensus which had quite low loan growth this year but some of the other headwinds i think would act as a partial counterweight to some of that guy stebbings q analyst exane sa united kingdom okay thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay we have time for one more question from the audio lines please and then well wrap up hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 operator thank you your final question from the audio lines comes from fahed kunwar from redburn please go ahead your line is open fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd hi and thanks for taking my questions and thanks for all the details there just two quick ones i guess tangentially on nim the first one is your rate sensitivity on a 12month basis has gone up it looks like its pretty much all in the uk can i just understand whats really driven that and why you dont think your us rate sensitivity would have gone up as well and in hong kong as well of course and my second question was just an earlier answer you gave on the commercial business talking about asset repricing as being one of the pillars of revenue growth normally when we see an excess liquidity weve seen the opposite in the sense that actually competition brings margins down can i just understand like what do you see on the ground of underlying asset margin competition given i guess very high liquidity across the board all of your peers both global and local thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc well just we are seeing some early signs of asset repricing taking place particularly in asia i dont want to overpromise on the quantum of that but we are seeing some early signs of that in the second half of last year so we do believe that is a viable option for mitigating some of the overall pressures on nim from lower interest rates and ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i think in the uk again in the mortgage market actually weve seen better spreads and actually our share of new business has gone up and so yeah i mean were not its not on the come we are actually seeing improved asset side margins in a number of parts of the business at the moment yeah on the interest rate sensitivity in the uk i think it was mainly driven by higher shortterm asset and liabilities balances particularly on the liability side which has gone up materially if you look at the liquidity in the uk its very very strong at the moment fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd thank you actually a followup how do you reconcile i guess looking ahead the high liquidity youre talking about the uk and then obviously in asia where you have sustainable asset repricing what do you think is different this time for us to kind of think okay repricing can hold and stay there with that much liquidity around thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i went through the gfc and life after the gfc and we saw our asset repricing taking place there as well and i think peter your track record in asia of dealing with low interest rates environment post gfc do you just want to share some of your thoughts about how youve handled that in the past hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23feb2021 peter wong tung shun a deputy chairman and chief executivethe hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited hsbc holdings plc yeah we remember back in after the lehman crisis the interest rate scenario was extremely low however we were able to between to our total income went up on a compounded basis by if we look at to it would be so were accustomed to dealing with a low interest rate environment and were able to reprice our asset our asset portfolio and also change the mix of our deposit portfolio richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc okay back to you noel to sum up thank you noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc well thank you very much for your questions and for taking the time to be with us i just want to remind you of some of the key messages we shared with you earlier in the morning first we have executed our promises in and
