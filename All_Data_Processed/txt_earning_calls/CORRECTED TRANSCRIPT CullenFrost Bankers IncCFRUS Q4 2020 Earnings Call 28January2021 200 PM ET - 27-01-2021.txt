review fourth quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will also provide additional comments before we open it up to your questions in the fourth quarter cullenfrost earned million or a share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year and million or a share in the third quarter of for the fullyear cullenfrost earned million or a share compared with earnings of million or a share reported for our team continues to manage expenses while at the same time pursuing the expansion of market share and investing for longterm growth overall average loans in the fourth quarter were billion an increase of compared with billion in the fourth quarter of last year but excluding ppp loans fourth quarter average loans of billion represented a increase compared to the fourth quarter of average deposits in the fourth quarter were billion an increase of compared with the billion in the fourth quarter of last year for the second consecutive quarter weve seen the highest quarterly average deposits in our history this growth reflects that frost has always been a safe haven for customers in times of uncertainty and also our success in building new relationships our return on average assets and average common equity in the fourth quarter was basis points and respectively we saw a reduction in our credit loss expense to million in the fourth quarter down from million in the third quarter of and this compared to million in the fourth quarter of last year net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were million compared with million in the third quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were basis points of average loans nonperforming assets were only million at yearend down from the million at the end of the third quarter a year ago nonperformers stood at million overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the fourth quarter were million or basis points of periodend loans those numbers will remain within our standards and comparable to what weve experienced in the last several years regarding payment deferrals in total weve granted 90day deferrals to more than customers for loans totaling billion and at the end of the fourth quarter only about million remained in deferment total problem loans which we define as risk grade and higher were million at the end of the fourth quarter in line with the million at the end of the third energyrelated problem loans were million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to million for the previous quarter and million for the fourth quarter of last year to put that in perspective total problem energy loans peaked at nearly million early in energy loans continue to decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to of our nonppp portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter as a reminder that figure was at the end of the third quarter and the peak was back in we continue to work hard to rationalize our companys exposure to the energy segment to appropriate levels throughout the pandemics economic impacts on our portfolio were negative but manageable and our overall outlook for credit quality is stable to improving in the second half of we discussed the nonenergy cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 portfolio segments that have had an increased impact from the economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic restaurants hotels entertainment and sports and retail a total of these portfolio segments excluding ppp loans represented just under billion at the end of the fourth quarter and our loan loss reserve for these segments was we saw the largest reserve increases in hotels and restaurants where our allocated allowances as a percentage of outstanding balances are now and respectively we continue to monitor credit in these areas closely and we will have a good and we have a good handle on our risk and as a reminder hotels and lodging represent approximately of our total loans and restaurants represent approximately of our total loans to me a really bright spot is the growth in our commercial relationships in they were up by compared to a year ago were great at building relationships its what we do its in our mission statement but clearly for us national recognition with success in going above and beyond to obtain ppp loans for its customers had a positive impact in the market in addition our houston expansion is also contributing to our success here new commercial relationships in houston grew in and represented of the new commercial relationships companywide during the year for the year our loan commitments booked were down compared to the prior year and reflected the impact of the pandemic regarding new loan commitments booked the balance between these relationships has stayed steady at larger and core at the end of the market remains very competitive the percentage of deals lost to structure increased from this time last year to this year our weighted current active loan pipeline in the fourth quarter dropped by about compared with the end of the third quarter reflecting the continued impact of the pandemic on business activity consumer banking continues to see good growth overall our net new customer growth for the fourth quarter was up compared to the precovid fourth quarter of samestore sales is measured by account openings or branches opened less than a year were up by though the end of the fourth quarter when compared to the fourth quarter and up compared to the prior quarter here again our houston expansion is helping this growth for example despite currently representing only about of our total consumer households houston contributed of fourth quarter total company consumer household growth in the fourth quarter of our account openings came from our online channel including our frost mobile app online account openings were higher compared to the fourth quarter of the consumer loan portfolio was up billion at the end of the fourth quarter up by compared to the fourth quarter last year our houston expansion is nearing completion with two new financial centers opened in the fourth quarter for a total of of the planned new financial centers covid has had an impact on our rollout but we expect to open the remaining three in the first half of this year overall the new financial centers are exceeding our expectations and the new locations were wellplaced and welltimed to leverage our success in obtaining ppp loans for the market the fourth quarter also saw the opening of our new financial center in college station with a second financial center to open in nearby bryan later this quarter so far in january our newest location in dallas the red bird financial center location also opened for business we remain committed to consistent sustainable above cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 average organic growth we also remain committed to managing cost and operating as efficiently as possible this month we took the difficult step of eliminating positions across the company where business needs have changed where technology could be better utilized and where responsibilities could be consolidated this along with broadly successful efforts to improve efficiency which jerry will discuss positioned us well as we move into i talk often about the dedication skill of frost bankers and about their commitment to the frost philosophy and culture throughout a difficult and now into a new year that promises to be challenging in its own way the people of frost have been and will be ready to provide the level of worldclass customer service frost is known for im thankful for them im proud of what weve accomplished and im optimistic about the longterm wellbeing of the company and the communities we serve now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease was almost all a result of a higher proportion of earning assets being invested in loweryielding balances at the fed in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter interestbearing deposits at the fed earning basis points averaged billion or of our earning assets in the fourth quarter up from billion or of earning assets in the third quarter the taxable equivalent loan yield for the fourth quarter was up basis point from the previous quarter average loan volumes in the fourth quarter of billion were down million from the third quarter average of billion the decrease was driven by a decrease of million and average ppp loans as a result of those balances being forgiven excluding ppp loans average loans in the fourth quarter were up about million or on an annualized basis from last quarter looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the fourth quarter down about million from the third quarter average of billion the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the fourth quarter down basis points from the third quarter the lower portfolio yield was driven by a decrease in the yield in our taxable portfolio the yield on that portfolio which averaged billion during the quarter was down basis points from the third quarter to as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency mbs securities given faster prepayment speeds and lower yields associated with recent purchases our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the fourth quarter down million from the third quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of up basis point from the prior quarter at the end of the fourth quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psfinsured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of fourth quarter was years compared to years last quarter during the fourth quarter our investment purchases were less than million and consistent primarily of mbs securities as we look out into we currently are not expecting to make a significant amount of investment purchases in this market we are currently only expecting to make purchases in the neighborhood of about billion which will help to offset a portion of our maturities and expected prepayments in calls cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 regarding noninterest expense for the fourth quarter ill point out that noninterest expense includes about million in onetime restructuring costs with million of that related to severance impacted by the eliminated positions phil noted as we mentioned last quarter and as phil mentioned in his comments in this environment we continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending and looking for ways to operate more efficiently we have worked and continue to work in a collaborative manner across our organization to look for ways to operate more efficiently without affecting our customer experience we challenged ourselves to eliminate open positions where possible and reorganized operating areas including using technology where it makes sense to further automate processes we use a thoughtful process to reorganize positions where the business needs have changed where technology could be better utilized and where responsibilities could be consolidated we asked our teammates to question discretionary spending and visited with vendor relationships to reduce costs where we could all this was done without losing sight of our core values of integrity caring and excellence we believe that we have always been prudent in managing expenses but in this zero rate environment our approach has become even more focused we began this process in the second quarter of last year as we began to deal with the challenges of the pandemic and a zero interest rate environment our initial guidance for expense growth for was around and we actually ended up with a growth rate of under on reported noninterest expenses to over obviously the changes resulting from the operating environment and lower incentives affected the decrease somewhat but overall it shows our teams commitment to managing expenses in this environment now looking forward into to we expect an annual expense growth of something around the to range growth off of our total reported noninterest expenses regarding income taxes we currently expect our effective tax rate for to be a little higher than our effective tax rate of just as a reminder income tax expense included a discrete onetime credit of million regarding the estimates for fullyear earnings we currently believe that the current mean of analyst estimates of is a little low this assumes a steady operating environment with no unexpected credit event with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry and well now open up the call for questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw your line is now open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i wanted to start with the ppp loans i know some of those got forgiven in the fourth quarter what was the dollar amount of spread income impact from ppp in the fourth quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah give me a second here ill say that the fee portion i know was around let me grab it here just so i dont have to give you any false information it was about million brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i know you guys were pretty successful in round of the ppp theres over million of earnings if i remember right what about round i know its early but any idea how big that could be at across round of ppp phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady were seeing really good volume our people worked around the clock once the sba gave us the information about how wed be integrating with them and it was a new system frontend i think we have about days to stand up our portal and our processes and it was we have so far gotten well lets see its the the piece paper i have right now has over applications i think earlier today i got one maybe or so and we got around applications approved by the sba back to us so the process is working really well its an automated process weve seen good application volume the this number that i was looking at that i told you about was lets see the which in ppp it used to be an eon but lets say its pretty good and that was close to billion worth of volume so weve seen bit lower average loan cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 size than we did in the first round i think our first round had a number that was i will say 180000ish number this time so far its been about average size i will say that weve seen a volume slow more recently it looks like the people that needed this money were lined up to really get in line and weve seen that of the numbers that are coming in are from first time ppp borrower or excuse me second time ppp borrowers so weve seen good activity there brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats good color and then finally for me its uncommon to hear about cullenfrost going to lay off i think the last time you all did that might have been a couple of decades ago i know those times are tough especially with this yield curve those layoffs i think theyre about of your staff is that a oneanddone deal or will you continue to look not just at the workforce but elsewhere as far as expense reductions this year phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah brady youre right it was a tough thing to do and it was one of the first thing we started really was the last thing and as jerry has kind of been reporting hes modestly been trimming that number he got indiscernible first of the year down to i think it was under or so down to right for the year so there were so many different things that we did we got a fair amount of visibility when we as an executive team we cut our salaries and in our last quarter call i told you about how our board was they immediately in their private session decided to cut their compensation just a vary frost thing do its so we started with those kind of things and everything thats discretionary when we got down to the end of it we did need to reduce some of these positions because it was the right thing to do we didnt take out a hatchet and made the reductions they were very thoughtful i think one thing though that we decided to do is reduce the amount of open positions i mean wed much rather reduce a position for someone we dont know and havent hired yet than doing that for someone we have hired and so there were many more positions that were open that were reduced than there were reduced recurrent staff so no its not something that were planning on doing and its not in our outlook right now its also true though all banks have been reducing expenses on staffing related to business activity for years right i mean i can go back and look at i think it was prefinancial crisis i was looking at our average assets per employee it was something around million each and then i think if you just go back to a couple of years ago it was literally double that level so weve been using technology more effectively and efficiently i think were using it smarter and were giving better customer experiences with it and so that will have an impact on our growth and people which we wanted to and expect that to be the case but no were not anticipating anything similar to what we did in january jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady this is jerry the one thing i will say though is that were not shifting our focus away from expense management so i think phil is right that the layoffs were tough to do and were the last thing to do but we continue to work with the executive team and really the whole organization looking to them to continue to participate in trying to save expenses where we can to be smarter about the things we do and try to find more cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 efficiency so hopefully in this environment thats something that our staff will continue to hear us talking about and hopefully continue to focus on brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities sir your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yes first if i could just follow up jerry on ppp a couple of just question around the model could you remind us what the balance was of ppp loans at the end of the year and how much of fees are left to be accrued tied to ppp jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure theres about million left to be earned and we expect all of that to be earned in and at the end of the year our ppp balance was billion down from billion at the end of september ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and do you expect the vast majority of that to come through in the first quarter i think you expected that last earnings call jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i think that what weve seen we had million roughly im going to say i dont have the number right in front of me but i think its right between that paid off or that was forgiven if you will between september and december it really seems to have slowed down towards the last part of december and into january i would expect right now based on the best information we have is that will bleed in to the second quarter as well so a little bit slower than we expected here in january cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and again just another question around is i appreciate what youre trying to do in terms of making the franchise more efficient i guess nothing wrong with that but just talk to us in terms of growth outlook means and one of your competitors had a call yesterday and talked about all the great things happening in texas indiscernible headquarters being moved folks moving from the coasts to texas given that frost is probably the largest sort of texas bank what does this mean for earnings growth loan growth for the bank like talk to us that there and in terms of what are you doing in terms of actually hiring and putting more investments on the technology frontline personnel phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim well with regard to texas and texas growth i mean i would agree to them the people have been moving here for a long time weve seen a stepup in growth its amazing to see the relocations coming from other markets some of the brokers that we have business relationships and these are very successful brokers i remember one telling me its awesome that it used to be of the relocations that they saw from out of state were from california now its about half california and half mid and east midwest east coast and so its i think its gaining momentum i think were trying to understand the longterm impact of it particularly in austin i mean its theres been a consistency to this kind of thing but the rate of growth and momentum in the austin market has really been remarkable over the last several months and were trying to understand the longerterm impact for that in that market and then what it means to us in terms of capital allocation and how we approach that market so i think thats literally developing as we all read the headlines and experience the growth as far as our expectations on loan growth i mean things still are really driven by the pandemic and impacts were seeing there i mean we you saw you heard me talk about new relationship growth i mean i think its remarkable to have that kind of relationship growth in a pandemic situation where you really cant get out and visit customers the same way you used to be able to do it and so thats really positive at the same time our pipeline is down and its and i really believe thats related to the pandemic and were just going to have to see the general level of business confidence increase and get healthy before we see that go up i think we tried to achieve highsingledigit loan growth through the year i dont expect us to do that without the ppp loans i dont expect us to do that i expect us to be below that and then well work hard to beat it but its a tough environment but nothings changed in terms of the fundamental outlook for the for texas and for our company i mean were being successful i think were taking market share and were the investments were making that i know were hard for our shareholders to when we were spending current operating earnings for houston i really see them paying off as we continue to move forward and were going to continue to do that kind of thing so im really im optimistic about the future but this year its going to continue to be under pressure from covid ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for taking the questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc sorry oh thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley your line is now open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc phil you mentioned i forgot the numbers right something like of your new account openings were through the digital channels where were those customers located because im trying to understand if those customers are if they live in the same towns as your existing branches or are they coming from outside of your existing footprint thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc ken we found a number that i thought was interesting it looks like houston for example of the accounts that were opened online were within a fiveminute drive of an existing frost location so i think there are a number of factors at work i believe people more and more its been our experience more and more doing their research online which is a positive for us because youll see really if you take the time to research youll to see very positive reviews and reactions to us and then they are i think the fact that say houston reported how its an outsized percentage of our growth not the only growth were having but it is its an outsized percentage people are seeing new locations where they live and theyre opening up and just we just had a lot of success online so i would say that they tend to be theyve tended to be inmarket in the markets that were in and they tend to be proximate to locations we have but as i just said were within a fiveminute drive of our locations in houston and so that means work so there is some indiscernible ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah that is an interesting statistic i guess more taking it a little bit more broadly does that imply because i know a lot of the banks are obviously focusing very heavily on digital but does that imply that to continue to grow your new customer base banks also would have to continue to open new branches to expand their potential customers who would apply online cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i hate to make that broad statement but i can tell you that just looking directly at our expansion in houston right where it was almost a doubling of our locations and youre seeing the account growth that ive talked about in the commercial side and the consumer side i mean its certainly helpful and its additive to the process i mean its one thing i always like to point out about our strategy though in houston because its fun to talk mainly about consumer because i think we all relate to that as individuals the biggest revenue piece of that strategy has to do with small and midsized businesses if you look at our company overall what is it 90orso of our loan book in round numbers comes from the commercial side commercial real estate commercial ci lending and our deposit base is really the last time i looked at it it was about commercial so what were doing is really trying to replicate our business model in these markets and that means its a very strong small to midsized commercial banking market so one of the things that ive mentioned before is back when i could do customer calls and facetofaces back in a number of times i was with people that were doing live or ftes for new banks and our nearest locations so id like to keep that in mind theres very much a commercial focus there as well and weve seen really good growth in our commercial relationships in houston ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you very much phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities your line is now open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 can you just talk about whats driving your expense growth for this year in terms of your guidance and you talked about the indiscernible growth that austin is seeing will you be putting more branches at market jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc regarding the expenses jennifer a couple of things ill mention that as i mentioned in my comments obviously there was some benefit if you will in expenses related to the fact that a lot of incentives werent paid right we werent meeting the targets that we needed to meet and so our projections for do represent that well have some increases there we also have the impact of the houston expansion we talked about that we have planned on that they would all be open by the end of they that process has been a little bit slower than we expected and so we still actually have three more branches to open and we opened quite a few in the latter part of so theyre having a full year impact on im going to say those are primarily the big things that were affecting the growth between and phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc and jennifer with regard to austin yeah i think when i talk about were evaluating the what the really dramatic growth austin is seeing at least in the headlines but more than that i was looking at the numbers with the fed job growth its pretty remarkable what theyve been able to do recently when we say were looking to understand the impact of that yeah it could result in us i think it will result in us at some point of adding to locations there and maybe above what we otherwise would have done well i think theres some work that needs to be done understanding it because its changing pretty rapidly but its an opportunity i believe jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point your line is now open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey dave phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey on the margin you guys hit your guide for the level just above for how are you guys thinking about that trend from the or the nii going forward whatever view here exppp given youre maybe muted for loan growth at least at this point in the year and then what do you see for new loans and indiscernible right now and what are your thoughts on the timing of that billion on securities purchases you were talking about jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc let me see if ive got all the pieces here on the nim i think you were asking about exppp as i mentioned in my comments right now were really not projecting a lot of investment purchases weve only i think our modeling billion weve got north of billion billion even billion some days at the fed and so obviously that net interest margin percentage is going to be reacting to that but theres definitely pressure obviously on the net interest margin right now the guidance i would give is if i look at that fourth quarter nim i would expect that well probably see highsingledigit movement downward there just given some of the rolloff of the loans that are that are maturing and being replaced by loweryielding loans and kind of the same thing on the investment portfolio and then again the net interest margin is were just having such a big impact from the level of deposits that weve got i was looking at it weve got i think indiscernible right now in todays market dont like what we see and so wed like the optionality that we have by sitting a little bit on the sidelines there david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah that makes sense what is the differential now on the front bookback book on the loan book at this point jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i guess sure yeah i guess ill just say if im looking at probably the most pressure were seeing im going to say is in the ci book i was looking and its probably about basis points if i look at the new book just being the stuff that we put in put on in the in the fourth quarter versus everything before that and i would david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i would think you would still have to see some deposit growth this year you will i would imagine still expect to see nii growth from the level you might see more nim indiscernible is that fair jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc well i think that thing with as far as nii growth is concerned is really dont forget that we do have ppp in there and we really i guess i should say that the guidance that we gave really doesnt include ppp that was almost intentional on our part we still need to see kind of what sort of volumes we get in there and weve had conversations internally cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 obviously there could be some impact on our projections for the loan growth by this ppp round if you will so in the and in weve recognized about million a quarter in ppp fee income in each of those last three quarters of the year and weve got about i think i said right under million to million left to earn that i expect well earn by the first couple of quarters of next year so well feel some pressure of that ex this new ppp fee but if you layer those back on yeah we still havent really brought that all into our model and looked at what we think will happen to our models loan growth david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your last question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so when you indicated that consensus of for is a little low id imagine consensus includes an assumption for a reserve releases do you assume reserve releases in your comment that eps for is low jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no we do not were not thats not part of what were assuming at this point in any guidance that we give steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then on expenses im honestly a bit confused over the message on expenses last quarter you talked about the need to get more efficient given the revenue headwinds or that you were cutting senior management base salaries but now youre guiding to to in which ive always considered a fairly normal year is the intense focus on expenses continuing in or is that a really event cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i mean the thing that was asked earlier is we are being impacted again were projecting a more normalized year as far as revenues and income growth and so there were some incentives obviously they didnt get paid out in that were projecting to increase so basically to get back on if you will in as i also mentioned houston expansion is really more expensive to us in than it was in it probably is a little north of a impact on our expense growth guidance but no the focus on expenses continues thats what i was saying in my comments well continue to do that but were not going to cut technology costs for example thats just not going to happen in this environment and so what well continue to focus on is ensuring that from a people standpoint that were doing what we need to do and that we really question all the open positions or all the requests for new positions within the organization but i think for us opening those houston branches and having them come all online as we think into is going to have an obvious impact on our growth and expenses versus what we had in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then final question you guys have always been the standout bank in your markets from a client satisfaction view but as we listen to all of your local competitors theyre all investing in technology seemed to be more focused on client experience are you seeing tougher competition in the markets more general phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc are you talking can you be a little bit more specific are you talking about commercial deals are you talking about steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah all of the above i mean when you talk to its just about every bank right theyre investing in technology theyre investing in digital theyre focused on friction points right client experience and you guys have had the highest client satisfaction score in your market and im wondering if you are in the past you were talking about losing deals primarily over price and structure but are you starting to lose more deals because other banks are just doing a much better job and thats commercial and consumer both phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc indiscernible no i would not say that at all i mean weve its kind of a broad question but i mean if you look at the it really has to do with it starts with culture and its a combination of technology and people i mean our technology is elegant and its branded its very userfriendly its smart and we were i was looking at some numbers on account opening online from a peer that i cant talk about because its risk got a confidentiality agreement but were one of the top banks of a large group of banks in terms of the account openings online so were starting from a good place and so i feel like the changes that were able to implement and have been implementing in technology still are able to were still able to move beyond the competition they can spend money and we are too and were all competing but ill just give an example we put a dark mode on our iphone cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 app and indiscernible dark mode that time and indiscernible dark mode i can go down the list i mean so they are chasing a moving target is what i would say about that and then on second thing i would say is as far as commercial competition and everything absolutely its bad and its getting worse i saw i think i already said it in my comments we went up from lost deals from structure it was i think people are hurting for volumes theyre stretching for deals they want to do and so yeah its worse were losing more to that kind of thing but ill tell you im prepared to lose deals for bad structure there is no greener pasture across the fence of good credit quality theres nothing there but a wasteland and i dont intend to go over there so yeah its complicated i mean its complicated but its also competitive and were ready to compete and ill take my team and compete with anybody in this market steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you for the color that was really helpful phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc absolutely operator we have a question from michael rose with raymond james your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hi thanks for taking my question are you guys doing anything on any of your fee businesses making any sort of targeted investments maybe you can give us an update on the trust business and the insurance business and then just quickly was there anything that drove the increase sequentially in other fee income thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well first of all broadly i mean in our feebased businesses yeah weve been investing in those too the one that comes to mind is we had a major system upgrade and conversion in our trust business which i cant tell how long weve been working on that but it was its been a positive to us and went just flawlessly so proud of the team and how they were able to do it and they did it from home during covid if you look at the our treasury management systems weve upgraded both of those we got really great scores from greenwich associates for treasury management and for years still do but for years we did it with a system that we were using a partner that we felt we could do better and we knew we could do better and there were features that we were frustrated when we werent able to bring to the table and we really got those high marks because of the quality of service our people give now we have systems which we have put in place to upgrade which has increased mobile capability et cetera for both the larger more sophisticated customers and then also for the smaller customers as well so were attacking the market there with a much better product offering on the technology side there cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 and one thing ill say about the major customers and the implementation that new system we did not lose any customers to attrition as a result of that system conversion ive never heard of that as it relates to treasury management system conversion usually what happens is if that happens you really go after those companies who happened to go through that because if theyre going through a conversion they might as well convert your system but for us to not have really any attrition for that system just speaks to the quality of the service that our people have been providing and also i think the quality of the system so yeah weve been putting some money there and jerry i think he had some questions with jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah regarding the linkedquarter other income yeah most of that is related to some debit card incentives that we recognized in the fourth quarter so from compared to the fourth quarter a year ago you dont see that sort of variability but in the linked third to fourth quarter youll see that there and then we also had a good month and our trading activity was higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the third and our public finance underwriting group had a strong quarter so those things impacted the variability on the linkedquarter basis michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc got it i appreciate all the color thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator operator instructions there are no further questions at this time you may continue phillip d green chairman chief executive officer
