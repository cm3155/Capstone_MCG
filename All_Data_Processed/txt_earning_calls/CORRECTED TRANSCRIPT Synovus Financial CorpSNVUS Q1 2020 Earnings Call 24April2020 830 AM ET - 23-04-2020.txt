chief executive officer synovus financial corp well thank you kevin and good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call id like to begin by thanking our extraordinary team members who continue to go above and beyond to support our customers during this difficult time we have two main stories today and probably many more one is of our strong core operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival the other equally important story is of the strength and resilience of our company which has again proven our ability to innovate to execute quickly and effectively manage day to day operations while also shifting priorities and resources to meet emerging needs from the very beginning of this covid19 healthcare crisis the decisions and actions taken by our team have been guided by two principles doing whats best for the physical and financial wellbeing of our team members and doing whats best for our customers with those principles in mind in march our branches were converted to drivethrough and appointmentonly and we implemented aggressive cleaning sanitizing and hygiene protocols at all of our company facilities more than of our team members are now working from home and our it team did a fabulous job quickly repositioning our workforce weve offered additional paid time off to team members who were sick who are quarantining or dealing with childcare or other covid related family hardships and were offering bonus payments to hourly team members required to work onsite to serve our customers synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 to help our customers through this period of financial distress were waving nsf and monthly service fees and offering payment deferment and other loan relief as appropriate although social distancing has more or less eliminated the inperson handson approach we usually take toward community service were doing everything we can to support needs across our footprint including matching contributions to the american red cross providing financial support for feeding america and funding meals for first responders and frontline healthcare providers i am especially proud of the effort our team has made to deliver paycheck protection program loans to our customers since the launch of p3 on april the 3rd our team has processed approved and funded more than billion in loans for customers were continuing to process submissions in our pipeline preparing to fund as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week kevin blair will talk more about the key aspects of our covid19 response later in his remarks before i cover highlights of the first quarter i want to talk about our confidence in our ability to manage through this current crisis and to emerge from it in an even stronger position since the last crisis our company has continually taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment including efforts to strengthen management into key risk areas of capital credit and liquidity we routinely deploy stress testing and sensitivity analyses to inform business decisions and we believe were well positioned to sustain an economic downturn such as were facing today as well discuss during this mornings call weve enhanced our portfolio monitoring and our credit profile includes improved mix metrics and outlook and our allowance build under cecl guidelines provides further protection against credit losses on capital our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain strong capital ratios in stressed economic environments and our liquidity position remains strong were also assessing and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our synovus forward program kevin blair is going to share more details later in the call on the steps were taking to ensure were addressing the shortterm imperatives while also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company longterm so before i turn the call over to jamie i will briefly walk through highlights of the quarter on slide adjusted diluted eps was compared to a year ago this yearoveryear decline was driven by basis point reduction in the fed funds rate the scheduled loss of loan accretion from acquired loans and a significant increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of covid19 under the cecl framework we were very pleased with the fundamentals of our core performance including periodend loan growth of billion deposit growth of billion and core transaction deposit growth of more than million core net interest income which excludes purchase accounting adjustments was flat for the quarter however the core net interest margin declined basis points from the prior quarter slightly more than our original expectations due to the more significant reduction in interest rates adjusted noninterest revenue of million grew million from a banner fourth quarter benefiting from significant activity in mortgage capital markets and fiduciary businesses this was despite lower seasonal core banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to serve clients during this covid19 disruption adjusted noninterest expense totaled million for the quarter up million versus the previous quarter largely due to the million increase in seasonal payroll taxes that were referenced during our fourth quarter earnings call we also had an incremental million in expenses associated with the covid related bonus payments for certain frontline team members provision for credit losses was million and resulted in an synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 allowance for credit losses ratio of these metrics incorporate the impact from covid and the first quarter of cecl ill now turn the call over to jamie for a more detail look at the first quarter beginning on slide and ill rejoin with a few more comments in questionandanswer after jamie and kevin blair have given their report andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel before i get started walking through the quarterly performance id like to highlight that we have withdrawn our guidance we will give some nearterm indications of financial performance on key metrics throughout my commentary and we are committed to reestablishing longer term targets when the economy stabilizes we discussed our increased productivity a bit on the fourth quarter call and it continued on to the first quarter with billion in total loan production our wholesale banking team on boarded new customers during the quarter which represented billion in new loans in march we saw million increase in line utilization ci line utilization plateaued at in march as some customers increased draws out of an abundance of caution related to the economic situation we are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we remain disciplined in our underwriting in the second quarter we expect loans from the paycheck protection program to serve as the primary engine for loan growth as traditional pipelines have declined the rate cuts in march led loan yields of excluding purchase accounting a decline of basis points from the prior quarter the full quarter impact of these march cuts will have a greater impact on the average loan yields in the second quarter unadjusted for hedges approximately of our loans have a floating rate as previously discussed we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in shortterm rates on our floating rate loan portfolio at quarter end we had billion in receivefixed swap associated with these hedges with an average rate of versus onemonth libor slide shows deposit growth of billion which included a continued increases in core transaction deposits of million in the first quarter we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increase balances and replace highercost singleservice deposits we will continue to monitor these markets for opportunities in what remains a dynamic deposit environment and remain focused on growing our core deposit base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile in terms of overall deposit pricing weve certainly seen a response to the recent fomc actions and as you can see our total interestbearing cost in march was approximately basis points lower than the average from the prior quarter in this easing cycle the fomc cut their target rate by basis points and our general expectations is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid as deposits repriced throughout the year as you can see on slide net interest income of million declined million from the prior quarter the majority of that decline or million was attributable to the expected decline in purchase accounting adjustments the core net interest margin which excludes paa decreased basis points from the prior quarter to as we look into the second quarter we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat as a result of significant loan growth associated with p3 however this growth along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 cash position is expected to weigh on our net interest margin excluding those impacts we reiterate that we expect the margin to decline basis points to basis points per basis point decrease we expect the majority of the impact from march rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter on slide you will see that we have had continued success in fee revenue generation which increased to million adjusted thats an increase of million from the prior quarter and up million or versus the prior year in the first quarter we continue to have diversified strength in our fee revenue businesses mortgage revenue driven by high production levels and elevated secondary gain on sale margins increased million capital markets volumes were higher by million as our commercial clients locked down lower rates on their borrowings and income from brokerage grew million driven by increasing contributions of new hires in and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility these increases more than offset reductions in areas such as service charges on deposit accounts primarily due to a decline in retail nsf fees however covid is already impacting customer behavior including significant declines in capital markets activity lower debit and credit card transaction volumes and overall business disruption for commercial clients this disruption will likely result in fee revenue declining to in the second quarter from our recent run rate of approximately million we would expect an increase in noninterest revenues as the economy stabilizes moving to slide in the first quarter noninterest expense was million or million adjusted adjusted expenses increased million from the prior quarter generally in line with our prior guidance with the increased levels of the covidrelated expenses which we currently estimate at million to million in the second quarter we expect adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable quarteronquarter before declining in the second half of the year as kevin will discuss in a moment we remain confident that our efforts over the past six months to identify ways to improve our operating efficiency will result in positive operating leverage over the longterm we are tailoring the timing of our synovus forward initiative to ensure they do not distract from our focus on team members customers and communities this doesnt change our commitments or strategy it simply adjusts the timing slide shows our credit quality metrics as well as a summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance net charge off at basis points remain within prior guidance the npl ratio did increase from the prior quarter to basis points and this is up basis point from the prior year additionally past dues returned to the low end of the recent range at basis points while we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as it progress through the current economic environment it is important to note that we are entering this downturn well positioned from a credit quality standpoint with npas npls past dues and chargeoff ator near lows for this economic cycle provision for credit losses and allowance for the quarter were impacted by the adoption of cecl on january which generally results in higher provision for credit losses compared to the incurred loss method this is amplified by the forwardlooking aspects of cecl and how it is impacted by the heightened economic stress from the healthcare crisis and resulting economic slowdown as you can see on slide the day reserve increase was million or we did elect the fiveyear transition period for regulatory capital treatment our 10k referenced a two year reasonable and supportable period used in cecl estimates but it was deemed more appropriate to reduce that to one year horizon during this period of heightened economic uncertainty a one year reversion to the mean follows the reasonable and supportable period the deterioration in the economic environment since january 1st due to the current synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 healthcare crisis resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of march 31st than was modeled in the day cecl implementation and is currently at our modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform cecl estimates the internally developed economic forecasts used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of march 31st was approved on march 20th at the time the approved forecast aligned with rating agency and wall street economic forecast between that approval date and quarter end we saw further deterioration in the economic outlook which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses the qualitative overlay of million adds basis points to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the total allowance with the economic indicators and forecasts at the end of the first quarter significant economic uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and they ultimately impact our government stimulus efforts if our economic outlook on june 30th resembles these more recent forecast we would expect to see further increase in the allowance for credit losses capital ratios on slide include the impact of cecl and incorporate applicable regulatory transition periods as weve shared in the past our target capital ratios were determined through our routine internal capital adequacy assessment process and included the capital optimization efforts completed in these capital ratios give us comfort that even in a severely adverse scenario we have a sufficient buffer to withstand the losses and remain well capitalized in the first quarter our cet1 ratio declined largely due to the increase in riskweighted assets which accounted for reduction of basis points our continued strength in ppnr generated basis points of capital which more than offset the basis point impact of cecl related allowance build as a result of cecl we anticipate capital ratio degradation earlier in a recessionary environment than under prior accounting guidance however it is that allowance which will provide a significant buffer to absorb any realized losses later in the cycle and affords us the ability to return to our capital targets over time currently the allowance build was reflected in the total riskbased capital ratio which increased basis points from the prior quarter to based on the same framework that was established and utilized for stress testing under the doddfrank act we continue to leverage our internal capital management processes these processes coupled with our risk appetite framework provide a road map and outlines capital preservation strategies in the event we see a more protracted period of economic weakness as we navigate through this recession we will be very diligent in how we deploy our balance sheet with a clear prioritization towards core customer relationships these processes also govern how we consider share repurchases in our common equity dividend through this process we determined to suspend our previously approved share repurchase program we continually evaluate our approach to common equity dividends in our capital planning process which is guided by our assessment of capital adequacy as well as our projection of sustainable longterm earnings we believe a change to the common dividend is not warranted at this time as discussed we remain confident in our capital adequacy and we continuously assess our longterm earnings outlook liquidity management has always been a priority at synovus and we continue to improve our liquidity profile in the first quarter we issued million of bank debt at very attractive levels and we increased our collateral at the federal home loan bank by approximately billion as shown on slide you can see that we have approximately billion in readily available balance sheet liquidity synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 while we expect loan balances excluding p3 loans to remain fairly flat over the near term we do anticipate considerable second quarter growth associated with our p3 lending effort to best manage our risk and to maintain our existing funding sources for other customer needs we anticipate using the federal reserves p3 lending facility to support funding for at least a portion of these loans we believe that this is the most effective way to manage our overall liquidity position and to mitigate the associated impact on our capital ratios kevin will now share a deeper dive on credit portfolios most impacted by covid some details about our responses to this crisis and provide an update on synovus forward kevin blair president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie and turning to slide before i go into deeper detail on several industries where the covid crisis is currently having a greater impact on business operations this seems like an appropriate time to take a deeper dive into the composition and the quality of our loan portfolio by category as well as the significance of the diversification and derisking benefits that have been realized since the last financial crisis the chart on this slide shows the key components of each of our three portfolio categories with a table on the bottom right showing the shift in the composition from our ci book totaled billion and is primarily comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries within ci the specialty division such as senior housing and premium finance comprised about of total loans and have been a significant contributor to our growth story while also possessing some of the best credit metrics over the last several years the overall portfolio is welldiversified by industry and geography and is extremely granular with almost loans with an average original loan balance of approximately the cre portfolio is billion and of the book is comprised of incomeproducing properties with multifamily office shopping center and hotel being the largest property types within the portfolio we do adhere to a disciplined concentration management philosophy thus our largest cre loan is less than million with an average loan size of approximately million this portfolio is diverse both from a geographic and property type standpoint with strong loantovalue and debt service coverage levels as a result this portfolio has continued to perform well and as it relates to net charge offs the cre book is in a net recovery position over the last five quarters the consumer book is billion almost threequarters of the consumer portfolio is in mortgage and heloc categories with the remainder in lending partnerships credit cards and other consumer you can see by the credit score and loantovalue statistics that this portfolio is super prime and remains very healthy under the existing economic conditions we expect our consumer portfolio to decline in the near term as we decrease our appetite for unsecured lending and thirdparty partnership purchases the last point i want to cover on this slide is the substantial improvement that weve made to the diversification and derisking of the entire loan portfolio from until first quarter in we have significantly reduced our exposure to to family residential land and investment properties as well as cre in aggregate by simply utilizing historical loss rates the remix of our portfolio alone would result in a reduction in losses combined with the improvements in underwriting and portfolio management we would expect losses to decline even further when evaluating the impact of the severely adverse scenario synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 moving to slide while our entire loan portfolio is continuously assessed we have introduced enhanced monitoring for the segments noted on slide these segments totaling billion had been identified as having a more direct and immediate impact from the covid19 crisis we are continuously working with our customers to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting their business operations and ultimately their cash burn rate we are leveraging payment deferments as well as the cares act stimulus program to help weather shortterm financial effects solid underwriting and strong credit performance coupled with stronger balance sheets that has been built during our extended expansionary period give us confidence that these portfolios enter this downturn in the best possible position in the appendix on slides through you will find more detail around each of these portfolios but i will touch on a few of them now our hotel book is over franchised and primarily contains nonresort properties more than of our hotels are rated upper midscale or above this portfolio has strong credit metrics with an average loantovalue of and debt service coverage ratios of times we have about billion of shopping center exposure to centers that arent grocery pharmacy or discount store anchored based on our southeastern footprint these locations are situated in markets that has continued to see good population and household income growth which has created growth and stability for these businesses as such these portfolios continue to perform well from a credit quality standpoint the restaurant book is million with of the book in limited service restaurants and in full service over of our restaurants are franchises and have an average loan size at origination of roughly million the next two industries are nonessential retail trade and arts entertainment and recreation combining for billion in outstanding both of these portfolios have performed well precrisis and are also very granular with average loan sizes at origination of million and million respectively lastly i will mention our relatively small exposure to oil related industries at less than of total loans given our five state footprint oil is not a prevalent industry particularly as it relates to exploration and production most of our exposures in transportation operations and support related to the industry this portfolio has exhibited strong credit performance but given the current state of the oil industry we are more closely monitoring our exposure our bankers and credit team members continue to work with and provide financial advice and consultation to our customers and ensure we are providing the necessary support to mitigate the shortterm disruption in cash flows as with our entire credit portfolio each of these portfolios has exhibited strong performance over the trailing quarters and years and was as well positioned as could be expected coming into the current environment the duration of the downturn will obviously determine the impact on these businesses and how quickly these industries will return to more normalized cash flow levels bob derrick our chief credit officer is with us this morning and can answer additional questions during the qa portion of todays call as we turn to slide and i address synovus forward i think its important to reinforce the message that kessel led off with in todays meeting despite rolling out our synovus forward playbook in march we quickly reconfigured our efforts to focus on our covid response starting with the safety and wellbeing of our team members who are vitally important to support our customers as well as the communities we serve we effectively exercised our business continuity plan which enabled our employees to work remotely while continuing to provide customer facing roles in our branches and call centers to meet the needs of our customers and quite frankly that was our other primary focus the safety and continued service of our customers although we continue to practice social distancing we are here to serve our customers and continue to provide advice and new solutions to help them navigate the changing business climate and support their business operation synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 in fact during the first quarter we implemented over new services in our treasury and payment solutions area which represented a increase over the first quarter of this is another proof point of our continued commitment to serve our customers and our ability to do so in a difficult climate and despite the crisis our bankers continue to call on and onboard new prospects as our relationship based approach is serving as a key differentiator in this trying environment were going to deploy our capital in areas where we receive optimal returns and while this business approach may produce lower loan growth in aggregate we will continue to focus on acquiring new full service relationships and deepening our current relationships with new opportunities as we have mentioned weve also taken a proactive approach to providing relief to our customers when needed from waving fees to increasing atm and mobile deposit limits to granting deferments on loan payments our loan deferment program is constructed to allow smaller loans upon request to receive a shortterm 90day deferral of interest and principal to the maturity date of the loan for larger loans we have initiated a credit driven approach to review the specific circumstances of each request analyze cash burn and obtain updated financial information while determining the need for the deferment to date our percentage of total deferrals is around of the overall portfolio with those industries more directly impacted by covid19 carrying higher percentages we also have closely monitored all of the stimulus actions and programs made available by the cares act obviously the paycheck protection program has had the greatest impact on our customers to this point we began the p3 process on march with an online expression of interest portal we began taking applications on april 3rd the day the program went live as kessel mentioned earlier as of today we have secured funding for over customers or approximately billion as i close let me transition to the future and synovus forward as we shared during an investor conference in march synovus forward is our newly formed program that was built to generate an incremental million of pretax income in the coming years and to lead the top quartile performance amongst midcap banks in terms of profitability and efficiency during the development of this program we evaluated over unique and distinct initiatives that included a combination of expense and revenue opportunities during our presentation in march we shared at a high level we expect to realize expense benefits of between million and million and revenue benefits of between million and million were confirming today that the incremental opportunity is still very achievable however many of the benefits have been delayed due to the focus on the current crisis many of the expense and revenue initiatives that were planned for the first half of will be recast into the second half of the year or in early while we have had to delay some initiatives we are also accelerating actions in others this includes increasing the efficiencies gained from the thirdparty spend initiative accelerating the development of digital and analytical capabilities to drive growth and manage risk and leveraging our remote environment to aggressively think about our physical distribution and locations we have also continued to invest in technology and more specifically my synovus our consumer digital portal in march we deployed major updates to enhance the bill pay and transfer experiences of our customers and as weve made improvements weve seen higher levels of enrollment and utilization while seeing our overall app rating increase and its important to note that the current crisis is creating opportunities to add new initiatives to the portfolio and resize current initiatives that we had planned the synovus forward portfolio is not rigid and will continue to evolve we are committed to delivering and growing the value as we address new economic and customer behavior realities synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 there is much work ahead of us and we understand the need to balance both shortterm and longterm priorities the end state benefits their timing and sizing may continue to evolve in this fluid environment but our synovus forward goals and objectives remain intact kessel let me turn it back over to you to closeout our call kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin and before we move to qa i want to again thank our team our customers and our shareholders and for a brief update on the weeks activities just wanted to share that on wednesday we hosted our first onlineonly virtual shareholder meeting among other actions our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the elimination of our for voting structure and supermajority voting requirements these changes reflect our boards continuing commitment to bestinclass corporate governance operator were now available for questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america securities please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess if we can just start with capital so when we look at this obviously you have enough capital from a regulatory perspective but when i look at this cet1 at just talk to us jamie kevin kessel in terms of how important is it for the capital cet1 just to be over versus where it is and what are your expectations in terms of when we look at the ppnr given basis points that you showed for do you expect that to lead you back to over what are your expectations on growth in other risk weighted assets given ppp should not really impact that just if you can to all of that that would be helpful kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 yeah ebrahim let me start and then ill turn to jamie i think your first question was how important is it weve said that we believe the target of was an appropriate target leading into this and so we dipped slightly below that quite frankly there was the big driver was the growth in riskweighted assets this quarter and driven by great production by our team as you saw nonppp long growth over billion so certainly it has now dipped below we dont expect that level of riskweighted asset growth that will diminish we believe in the second quarter and again youll see the ppp loan growth but that will not have effect on the capital ratios you had multiple parts of the questions im going to flip to jamie to go a little further andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks ebrahim and kessel just to tag on with that youre right ebrahim thats the question we feel really good about cet1 as the starting point we do a lot of stress testing in our capital adequacy process and we refresh with many different scenarios and when we look at severe adverse scenarios if you went back to our dfas from a couple years ago few years ago you would see that we had about capital degradation today when we run our stress test and severe adverse scenarios its a shade more than so right there again we feel really good and we expect capital ratios to decline when you head into an adverse scenario however youre right we have ppnrs as the first line of defense against that capital degradation you can see in the first quarter even though we had a large build in our allowance ppnr was more than net allowance build and as kessel said it was the billion of loan growth that really depleted cet1 so as we look forward theres definitely some uncertainty in this environment we dont know how everything will play out we feel good about our ratios where they are i did give some guidance you will see ppnr decline a little bit in the second quarter due to declines in nii predominantly nii should be fairly flat and so as we think about it we feel good about where we are we think that ppnr is the first line of defense really covers us on our need for allowance at this point however we would acknowledge the uncertainty in this environment ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful and just on the margin so the comments you made exppp essentially we should assume like basis points kind of basis points of degradation somewhere around the margin would be kind of where you would land in the current rate backdrop and can you talk about just how ppp will work through the system if these are forgiven should we see a spike at some point in on the yields tied to these loans kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp you would ebrahim again this is kessel because obviously you know this that were in theory able to fund on that basis points if we were to match fund through the facility and we put them on the books at and then therell be some fee associated based on the average loan which will flow in through the loan yields and then when theyre forgiven that will come back in i think through the nii lines so you would see an increase in margin there thats just a lot of uncertainty there todate we have seen those fund we have seen kind of corresponding growth in dda deposits but we know that behavior wont continue hopefully those customers are using the funds to pay employees you will see that come down and will begin accessing the ppp liquidity facility but i think youre right in your thinking there about how that will play out synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and ebrahim let me just add one thing to that when you look at our margin forecasts youre spot on with the basis points to basis points per basis point and the impact of the basis points in march and then theres two other things on top of that you talked about p3 we would say that p3 is about basis points to basis points of nim impact per billion just to kind of give you a way to toggle that then the other thing the other consideration that would not be in our typical sensitivity is holding elevated cash and so were holding more cash on the balance sheet today than we would in normal times and so that will be a little bit dilutive to the margin ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking the questions stay safe kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator the next question comes from jennifer demba of suntrust please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc kessel long term how do you think about some of these portfolios that are kind of more pandemic sensitive over the near term are these loan portfolios you think youll continue to be active in over the long term and specifically how do you guys feel about senior housing credit and the future demand for senior housing depending on how this pandemic plays out kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah well let me start jennifer since you addressed it to me and then ill ask kevin blair to jump in as well im going to reverse order on senior housing were very confident in that part of our book theres a in the appendix slide on senior housing thats about billion and again thats a vertical that has performed well since we on boarded that team in no credit losses in that book its a diverse book spread across states not much on the west coast large majority of thats private pay and again there may be some short term impact related synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 to new admissions if they were in theory a facility that had an outbreak reports ive had our facilities are in good shape but you have to be careful about what information you know but to the best of our knowledge those facilities are in good shape so longterm theres going to be a lot of demand there again shortterm if you had a facility that was slowing admissions it could be a shortterm but we again we think that part of our business is certainly a strength and i would put the team up against any in the industry as to some of the other books and then im going to turn it maybe to kevin yeah i mean in hindsight if you knew there was going to be a pandemic that would shut down the hotel business you probably wouldnt make hotel loans we like that part of our book its to loantovalue its got good operators mostly franchised not really focused on resorttype properties a lot of operators that have a lot of experience a lot of equity a lot of external sponsorship and so shortterm thats certainly going to be a stress book but one that we think over the longterm will rebound we think ours are really well underwritten and so again ill just touch on a couple of the others the shopping center youve got the anchored the grocery store the discounts the pharmacy those are in good shape with pretty good cash flow and then youve got the nonanchored where weve got a lot of attention so i mean yeah this is a chance for us to look at everything were doing thirdparty sponsorships everything thats consuming capital on our books today were looking at that as we go through this crisis making sure that capital isnt consumed longterm by a business that we think doesnt give us the appropriate return so again we feel good about the book we feel really good about the senior housing book and those stressed areas weve got we referred to it as enhanced monitoring i can assure you there is enhanced monitoring of everything in our book we want to highlight those that you all would find of interest kevin blair let me kick to you for anything else youd like or bob derrick would like to say about that book kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah kessel ill start and ill give bob a chance to mention some of the actual statistics but i think jennifer to your question if you think about all of these industries we believe that theyre going to return to some level of normalcy at some point i mean these are needed services and so many different ways and the way that weve thought about them as we underwritten them as we brought them on the books for the years theyve been here they are lower ltv higher debt service coverage borrowers that generally have recourse and so we believe that the shortterm nature of this crisis will have an impact but the longterm viability of many of these industries are going to return to normal and in many situations youre going to see revenues pick up because people have been social distancing and they are going to be more prone to go in and use these services so i dont think theres any second guessing but to kessels point i mean if you knew there was going to be a global pandemic you might think about so many different industries differently bob robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hi jennifer this is bob just a quick followup i wont belabor it kessel is exactly right and so is kevin if you go back and look at these portfolios specifically the cre portfolios and what it looked like in the previous crisis in terms of percentage of income producing properties that amount is way up so we now have a more cash flow centric book of real estate the underwriting is obviously comparatively speaking a lot stronger than it was from an equity coverage perspective in that book in the ci space in terms of strategic industries that we want to evaluate or play in probably nothing materially changes we like the spaces were in and the customers were in and they generally support our communities where we serve so i dont think strategically its going to change us synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 in an industry and as kessel mentioned our largest vertical is the senior housing vertical and we still think that has merit long term jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you operator thank you the next question comes from brad milsaps of piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brad andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co i appreciate all the detail and the color in the slide deck that was great just wanted to kind of followup on the margin discussion jamie i think i heard you say that you may be expected total maybe deposit base in the if i heard that correctly if i look back i think synovus interestbearing deposit costs were around basis points in i know that you have florida community now with that a little bit higher deposit cost relative to legacy synovus but just looking at a few of the categories jumbo time retail times some of the others the money market accounts do you feel like youve got an opportunity here to really kind of rightsize their book with kind of legacy synovus and get back to that level just kind of curious how youre thinking about the deposit side of things and the opportunity this might present andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thats a great question i mean as we look forward in we really we see opportunities to continue growing core deposits we have a steady trend there great performance and we expect that to continue in and when you marry that with flat loan growth due to what weve talked about a little bit of shrinking in thirdparty it really does position you well on the deposit side and so as we look into the second half of this year and in the early we do we agree with your premise there that there are opportunities for us to further reduce deposit costs and we will be looking at that brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just as my followup im sorry if i missed it but just kind of curious any early indication on the greensky portfolio kind of what you guys are monitoring there just kind of any update that you can give on that relationship and how youre thinking about it synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp hey brad this is kevin ill take that so look one of the things we have been monitoring is their level of deferment theyre a little lower than most of our consumer categories about so its holding up well i know that that team has been modifying their underwriting criteria on new flow to make sure that they are bringing in the right type of customer but for us as weve shared in the past this is really for us a return discussion and today with the waterfall arrangement that we have there we still feel very good about that relationship and about those asset classes but over time as jamie has mentioned in terms of capital conservation and making sure were getting proper returns i think youll see us reduce our appetite in general for thirdparty purchases and flow arrangements just so that we can use our capital for full relationship based opportunities and so it will over time become a in the near term will become a lower percentage of our balance sheet brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great and kevin it sounds like your approach to the deferrals is a little more strategic rather than wholesale have you seen the pace of those requests remain pretty steady or are they started to tail off at all just kind of curious on what your thoughts are kind of where that kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yes brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co that number of deferrals could head kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp its a great question because we did see an inflow of deferments request for deferments very early on and i give credit to our line of business leaders kevin howard wayne and barton singleton working with our credit team because any loan greater than million dollars had to go through a credit driven process so think about it as like a credit committee where theyre going through each individual requests looking at the underlying aspects of that bar gain new information on the financial statements trying to analyze cash burn so its really served the two functions number one helping our customers when theyre in need but two giving us an uptodate view on the underlying financial stability of that customer so yes it was i think a wellrun process in terms of the timing as i said a lot came in in the first week or two weve seen it trail off considerably to the point now where were really not adding many deferments to that book and just want to make sure that were clear on it its really just a day program brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it thank you guys synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you brad operator the next question comes from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi brady kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc when you look at synovus forward i know nearterm things are kind of moving around but i think you had targeted the million of preimprovement to be realized by year end is that timing still on track or has that been pushed off andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp our commitment remains to the million but youre right that the timing has been adjusted the beauty of this strategy is that we started and we did a lot of diagnostic work a lot of work in to determine what were effective possible initiatives to help us get better and we had a list of about different initiatives that we looked at and then we prioritized a subset of those weve talked about in the past in the past weve talked about to initiatives we actually have about in slide right now and so but as we look at those we have shifted we have some initiatives that are full steam ahead still at the same page as we originally thought we had some that we said you know what we need and we need to step back in this crisis environment its not the best time so lets pause on those and then there are other ones that weve accelerated but the net impact of that to us and to the financials is that the benefit will be delayed and so the benefits that we expected to start seeing come in at the end of will be in and so youre right we will see a little bit of a delay in the impact of those on expenses the only thing i would add to that before handing to kevin to give more insight into synovus forward is that our forecast for expenses in is the same as it was in january its just were getting there in a different way so in january when we talked about it we had that benefit of synovus forward coming in in the second half of the year reducing expenses improving efficiency but now the reduction in expenses is more due to declines in business activity in this environment we havent just had natural operating leverage that allows us to reduce expenses and so our expense outlook is the same but to your point the impact of synovus forward is the way kevin synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah brady i think jamie covered it well just ill highlight one activity that jamie mentioned just in terms of one of our bigger initiatives was on the thirdparty services and weve continued to work that initiative throughout the crisis and im pleased i mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are actually increasing the expected benefit from that program so although were delaying some things there are other projects that have been accelerated and they are actually bearing better fruit than we had expected so to jamies point were going to get here its just going to be on a slightly delayed basis brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful if you look at your stock that trades at almost an dividend yield jamie i heard your comments that theres no expected change in the dividend at this time but maybe just expand further on the safety and the stability of the common dividend here andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we think about our dividend policy and how we think about its really a function of two things first and foremost capital adequacy right and as weve said we remain very confident in our capital adequacy were well positioned we run a myriad of stress tests we feel very good there the second thing is forecasted long term earnings we believe that our payout ratio target to longterm forecasted earnings of to is appropriate but in this economic environment its really difficult for any company to forecast longterm earnings and so we continuously evaluate our dividend and our longterm earnings forecast to ensure that our payout ratio remains aligned with our objectives and so based on those factors and how we see everything today we believe our dividend is appropriate but as we go through the crisis well continually evaluate it brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks brady operator the next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons of d a davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hey kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co just a quick question on i know the obvious focus here is on reserve building and you guys took an aggressive step this quarter and you implied that its possible there may be more reserve building to come next quarter but as we would probably suspect that as we get later in the year maybe thats when losses start emerging and when you think about the reserves youre establishing now do you think in terms of utilizing those in other words theres going to be some point of letting that reserve bleed down as opposed to matching those net chargeoffs when they come and is that just how youre thinking about it going forward andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah i mean as we think about our allowance for credit losses i mean it is our best estimate at life of loan losses of our loan portfolio and so we had that build this quarter that we believe positions us well allowance to loan ratio acl to loan ratio we feel is strong and it reflects a pretty severe environment as i said on the call we do think that some of the forecasts you have seen in april are more severe and so there may be further build from here but you are right that as you go through this basically cecl forces you to frontload those losses and so you take that expense earlier in the cycle and thats exactly what were seeing right now kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you and just a quick followup i know there were a couple of questions before on ppp and in terms of the impact of that over the next few quarters that we would see balances go up in second quarter or maybe presumably come down in third quarter and theres a dilutive impact to the margin that you referred to in the second quarter maybe that comes off in third quarter the origination fee should we expect that to come theoretically through the margin as a benefit in third quarter and then i believe you referred to a dollar amount of expenses i dont know if it was related to ppp or just generally but are there going to be expenses related to this program in the second andor third quarter and just trying to gauge of that origination fee when it flows through how much would conceivably fall to the bottom line versus bonuses for your employees and such andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah we mentioned covid related expenses so we kind of grouped more things in it than just p3 and that was million to million in the second quarter youre spot on with the accounting treatment as we see it for the fees and that it flows through interest income and youre right when forgiveness happens that we will realize the fee and so there would likely be a spike to us its uncertain how that forgiveness process will play out so youre right it could be the third quarter it could be later it could come in overtime but that is exactly how it works you know youre right we have expenses with the p3 program we have an army of volunteers that are working all hours of the day there used to be a saying about bankers hours being nine to three im convinced right now that bankers hours are folks are working around the clock to deliver p3 to synovus customers and so were pretty excited about that but i would say the expenses associated with p3 are fairly minimal synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co great thank you operator the next question comes from tyler stafford of stephens please go ahead tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hey tyler andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning i hopped on pretty late so i apologize if you guys have already covered this but i just had a question about the uptick in the nonaccruals those were up i think around a little over quarteroverquarter how much of that was to the reclass from pci to pcd and can you just talk about kind of the underlying i guess core trends excluding that noise if there was any robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey tyler this is bob ill try to give you a flavor for that it was slightly related to the backing out of or moving away from the acquired purchased accounting on the gross up of nonaccruals we also had a specific credit that we had previously identified it did move to nonaccrual and the credit secured and it has an impairment reserve but thats a net number as well to your question more strategically about these levels as jamie mentioned i mean the broader credit metrics we still feel really good about the level of nonaccruals and the other credit metrics in that book the credit cost for the quarter we did have were not systemic they were not in any specific market or any specific line of business so the answer to your more overall question is the levels are just pretty low bps on npl compares favorably to a year ago basically about the same number so we feel good about these levels on where they are we look a step back and analyze our past due ratios and other early warning indicators that we have and all of those numbers seem to be favorable as well so kind of going into the crisis as consistent with a lot of others credit was in really pretty good shape tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay thank you for that i appreciate it and then i know you touched on some nearterm fee income guidance i think for the second quarter and again apologize if we missed it but whats the fee waivers that youd expect to see in or provide in given the covid related synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yes tyler this is kevin so weve had less than million of fee waivers todate and so its going to be in that range its not a material amount were doing it on an as requested basis so were not just providing fee waivers across the board so at this point its minimal well continue to monitor that but its less than million tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay all right thanks kevin i appreciate it thats it for me kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah operator the next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi jared kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just circling back on the expenses i guess the million to million thats incremental expenses thats anticipated to come in second quarter or that is in the first quarter number so i guess should we be looking at that sorry andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thats a second quarter number so our guidance on expenses is we will be flat quarteronquarter and first quarter to the second quarter and thats inclusive of the million to million of covid related expenses synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then assuming sort of everything starts opening up again those arent necessarily repeated in third quarter come out and then are we seeing additional expense cuts beyond that or is that a really driving the backend to lower expenses andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp no no no its not driving the back end those are the largest line in that covid related expense is the a day bonus were giving to our front line associates and so yes youre right that will go away at some point well have lower expenses in the second half of the year really due to the changing kind of economic activity jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just looking at the allowance in the qualitative growth you saw this quarter if we sort of end the quarter where we are today should we expect to see a similarly sized qualitative growth in second quarter just with the deterioration since march 31st andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah yeah good question the qualitative should be a little bit unique if you recall at the end of march every week majors the wall street economists rating agency economists they were updating their forecast really on a weekly basis and youre seeing tremendous change in every week the outlook for the economy and what happened is we had approved our economic forecast on march 20th and by the time we got to march 31st we realized that the outlook had significantly changed and so we went back and layered in that qualitative overlays really for the delta between march 28th and march 31st and so that should not be a continuous adjustment the only thing i would add though is that model in this environment model efficacy is difficult because of the stimulus programs its hard to say what the impact of spiking unemployment really will be with these stimulus programs and so i would say that the first quarter qualitative is unique however we will always look at the outputs of our models and make sure theyre appropriate jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator the next question comes from john pancari of evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hey john synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just a clarification on that last question on the qualitative when you say that thats unique are you implying that its not likely to be as large or just not likely to occur at all because youve already adjusted for the change in the macro backdrop in the april versus what we saw at the end of march andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp i think i understand your question youre asking so at the end of march we had our economic forecast and so if you want to think just to put kind of round numbers on that you have unemployment the scenario of allowance for credit losses represents a scenario where unemployment will go higher than big declines in gdp however since then if you look at most of these economic output or forecast they are more severe than that and so should when we do this in the end of june if our base case is what do you see from some of the wall street shop today its likely we will have a further build in the second quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi right okay all right and then to frame that longer term i guess wanted to see if you can help us think about how you look at through cycle loss content in your portfolio given a crisis like this i think the last time you had disclosed the dfas data it was before florida community understandably but maybe youre looking at about andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi million in throughcycle losses at that point so how do you think about it now can you give us some idea of when you run this analysis what youre coming up with in terms of through cycle loss content andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah so the dfas results that youre referring to has a losses and if we looked at it if we were when we run our severe adverse stress losses right now for eight quarter loss the still holds and thats another thing that weve looked at when we look at our allowance for credit losses at were right around those eight quarter severe adverse losses and we think that that makes sense and its in line with what were seeing from other peers and other large banks and so we do that comparison as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks no thats helpful and then one other followup on the reserve were the atrisk portfolios that you flagged you have the amount of allocated reserve to these portfolios synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah and we dont disclose we havent disclosed that john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thank you kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks john operator the next question comes from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess just wanted to ask about the sort of how youre thinking about the cecl reserves specifically in terms of the two year versus the one year reasonable and supportable period and i guess specifically by moving to a one year forecast period and then kind of assuming everything goes back to normal after that or reserve back to normal does that reduce your cecl reserve versus if you had taken a two year forward look using some of the economic data that youre talking about andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp you know ken we made that decision when you look at the economic forecasts that are out there and we looked at pretty much all of them you see a large decline here in the near term in the second quarter third quarter and then you see a bounce back and really when you look at the two year cumulative gdp in all these scenarios you get to down down and so we thought as we look at this first there was extreme uncertainty the forecasts were all over the place and our ability to forecast for two years it was just its not there to see that far forward and so we adjusted went to one year its something that we had planned for in an adverse environment but thats why we did it if you look at the impact of the one from two years to one year its really hard to quantify because of the adjustment we did with the qualitative factor that really that gets us back to where we likely would have been otherwise ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 got it okay and then just as a followup really quick one in terms of the cet1 ratio is there a level that you just absolutely dont want to drop below or maybe at the same level where regulators might start asking pointed questions thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well we cant comment on regulatory aspects of that i mean look in our capital adequacy effort and our work we do we have scenarios where we see capital indiscernible in severe adverse scenarios obviously we have it going down approximately in severe adverse but we feel good about where we are today when you look at that we are constantly looking at this and looking at the scenarios in light of the balance sheet and the risk in the balance sheet and credit metrics and so i would say theres no hard and fast number i mean we obviously have a risk appetite we obviously have ranges that pushes to different decisions but those arent all public ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thanks operator operator instructions the next question comes from garrett holland of baird please go ahead garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc good morning and thanks for taking the questions i appreciate the detail on the appendix of the deck on all the different covid portfolios but just wanted to followup on how youre thinking about the potential loss severities for these portfolios and the collateral protection that limits any downtime kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp okay so first of all back to the earlier comment on just trying to put a separate reserve in for these we dont talk about that because the models largely formulate a view on the severity based on the underlying economics and obviously the models are going to project some sort of loss on that as it relates to the portfolios themselves obviously what sort of loss content will be determined as we said earlier in terms of the severity and the length the revenue shortfalls and so we model those and we look at those thats part of the reason weve been doing the individual deferment assessments and we look at cash burns for each of these respective customers and trying to make an assessment for what the duration and how long they have in terms of cushions and protection so its very difficult to say within any of those industries what the loss content will be theres a lot of uncertainty a lot of factors that drive that bob i dont know if you would add anything to it robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah garrett just a quick followup this is bob i would just say that as we go through our evaluation process of deferment exits as these credits begin to come out of our deferment portfolios certainly then well get to evaluate kind of where the revenue accretion they can get back make an assessment of how quickly but generally speaking were staying with sort of the risk rating as they go through the deferment process and then as we begin to graduate credits out well make further assessments and begin to build our models on loss content i know synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 thats the question everybody want to know the loss content in these identified portfolios but were modeling that and well begin to do that as we bring these loans out of deferment garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks kevin thanks bob and just had a followup on asset quality i guess what are you seeing in the legacy fcb portfolio at this point and what if any is remaining of the unamortized loan mark and what does that mean from a pro forma reserve coverage robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey garrett this is bob again ill just start and see if anybody else wants to jump in just a couple of quick comments maybe if i could take a step back we started due diligence in that legacy fcb book almost two years ago this summer a lot of those and as you recall that was a wholesale type of book with not a lot of what we would call legacy smaller business credits in there so its been almost two years since the synovus team has been in there weve gone through a number of renewals theres been external and internal exams so my point in telling you all that is i do believe weve kind of graduated this portfolio into the synovus portfolio and we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the market itself and jamie or kevin could probably speak to the accounting but the mark was more than adequate we didnt get the losses it was more than adequate to cover so weve kind of graduated beyond that sort of legacy fcb legacy synovus approach and we like to think of it as one market and we feel really good about the credit metrics that we are seeing relatively speaking out of our florida portfolio recall garrett it is about a third of our book of business when you look at it from a state wide basis so that tells some general comments about how we look at that portfolio kevin i dont know whether you want to follow kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp i mean just from a business perspective i mean we continue to grow in that south florida marketplace it represents a big percentage of our growth and those loans are similar loans to what theyve been doing in the past and as we said in another calls in general the portfolio that we acquired from fcb and what was there today performs at a better level than the aggregate credit metrics of synovus in total so we continue to be very pleased with the credit quality there garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks for taking the questions kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks operator the next question comes from steven duong of rbc capital markets please go ahead steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question just first question on your billion ppp was that all with your clients and do you have an industry breakout of that kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp steven it was a mix it was primarily clients but gosh if its early on i really wont may be talk about other banks but lets just say our team stood up our portal quickly a very efficient process the large majority of applicants were customers because of a lot of reasons obviously your customer and other policies you really could process in more quickly however in a lot of our markets given ill just say frustration with maybe a customers other banking partner we did see great opportunity and in fact i think our small business new deposit accounts in the first couple of weeks in april hit record levels i dont have that detail in front of me but hit record levels as customers of other banks established banking relationships in order to then apply as a customer so kevin you may want to say more but id say large majority customer but a lot of new customers that just felt like and ive been really deluged with letters of thanks from new and old i will say this though on the ppp program were not celebrating or highfiving the fact that weve put billion out is ive said to our team and kevin and the great people that are working really theres no cause for celebration until the last application in our queue gets processed we cant guarantee funding we dont know how long this next appropriation will last but for every one whos really happy we know there are others that are waiting so again well hopefully i mean ive heard different indicators today of when the etran portal may open back up it seems like most people are pointing towards monday we were hopeful that it would happen before then because we were ready and again well celebrate is probably not the right word because in this environment were not celebrating but i can tell you our team is passionate and determined to get that last one through our queue kevin you may have some more on the customer new customer breakout kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah no kessel you nailed it its about its existing customers we did bring in some noncustomers who came in and just as from an industry standpoint its just as you would expect its going to follow some of those other industries our top industry is only a combination in food service side the arts and entertainment recreation some physician services are higher as well as retail trade so ironically it follows some of those industries we mentioned earlier in terms of the enhanced monitoring steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats really great to hear and then just a followup just on the loan deferrals i dont know if i missed it is there a number and amounts of the loan deferrals kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yes so we said its about of our entire books so its less than billion and its a little less than a notes and i think whats important to note there is of those notes of them are on the under million side so as weve talked about our process under a million were more of an automated process over a million went through our credit driven process so of the deferments were on the under million and then has over a million and that was really spread out amongst cre and ci and some of our private wealth loans synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and thats a typically a three months deferrals is that right kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thats right it would be very rare for anything to be more than days steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it all right i appreciate thank you operator and due to time constraints the last question today will come from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hi andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc just first in terms of the billion on the loan deferrals could you just break that down into ci cre and consumer andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah so when you look at deferrals in total if you break it down to those categories we have about of our cre book is deferred and about of our ci book and of our consumer book steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect and then one final one for kessel so a branch is now operating with only a drivethrough how is that going and based on what youre seeing could see a future where you only need a drivethrough thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 24apr2020 kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hey steven thats a great question and the answer is maybe yes now just to be clear all of our branches are also operating as appointmentonly we just need to know who were admitting control how many come in and make sure that theyre properly distanced but not just to the branches to our whole way of doing business yeah absolutely i think we could look at because you know what our team has responded remarkably but so have our customers and other than maybe some complaints about longer waits in call centers which we dont like as it relates to our branch service our customers have adapted well and then lots of notes about the use of the drive through and the appointmentonly and gotten the special treatment they get that way so as we go further and i was going to segue into synovus forward and look at branch rationalization i think wayne akins and his team are looking at how we have served customers whats the right staffing model going forward and whats the right physical capacity going forward and just on synovus forward i actually want to come back to one thing kevin commented on i think brady you asked about the timing of the expense and revenue and i want to take full blame for any delay in timing as we went into this crisis i said to our team one day i dont want to see any more consultants in the building in columbus in atlanta distracting our team from what needs to happen and then quickly we realized that our effort really needed to be focused on again what we said are two guiding principles were the physical and financial security of our team and again the same thing for our customers and their safety so we paused it but i can tell you to stevens question and others i believe its been an eye opener to our team about how we can do business differently and so while synovus forward paused kevin mentioned procurement we are also again vetting all of our initial thoughts and throwing new ones onto the table because of again the way we change so steven that was a long answer but the branch system has worked very well with drivethrough and appointment and it certainly is allowing us to think about again number of physical locations and levels of staffing to support what weve been supporting steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for all the color kessel d stelling a chairman chief

know kevin fitzsimmons ask about the cost related to ppp and there will be costs related to overtime related to all that were doing with bonus but theres also probably a cost of weariness and working
