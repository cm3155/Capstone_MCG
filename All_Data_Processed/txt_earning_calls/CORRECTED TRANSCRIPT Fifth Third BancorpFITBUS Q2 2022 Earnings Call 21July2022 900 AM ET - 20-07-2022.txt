questions with that let me turn it over to tim timothy n spence president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thanks chris and thank you all for joining us with this being my first earnings call as ceo id like to say what an honor it is to follow a great leader like greg carmichael lets jump right in earlier today we reported a solid second quarter reflecting our focus on profitability organic growth and throughthecycle returns we generated record adjusted revenue and maintained our expense discipline producing adjusted ppnr growth of compared to last year we extended our track record for strong organic growth adding new quality relationships in commercial and new households in consumer and both our recent acquisitions dividend finance and provide achieved audio gap originations chargeoffs remained low npas and earlystage delinquencies improved sequentially and we saw no decline in the liquidity buffers that our consumer households built during the pandemic with that said there is no question in my mind that the economic outlook is blurrier today than it was at the start of the year due to the potential forward economic challenges we are maintaining a prudently cautious view on credit as reflected in our reserve coverage turning to the balance sheet loan growth was solid and diversified across our franchise average commercial loan growth was driven by ci which included a increase in utilization on revolving lines of credit we fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 generated robust loan growth in nearly all our corporate banking verticals and our chicago cincinnati north and south carolina and florida regions led the way in middle market lending average consumer loans grew in almost all categories our results include a small benefit from our midmay closing of dividend finance were very excited about dividend as rising energy costs and the trend of homeowners improving their existing homes versus trading up only enhances our market opportunity switching to deposits our second quarter results were in line with our prior commentary with average balances intentionally down billion sequentially and stable from the prior year as we focused on margins over volume given our overall liquidity position we have a very strong deposit base with a higher allocation of consumer deposits in the stable retail category than any institution that reports as part of the lcr rule consumer transaction deposits grew sequentially and increased on a yearoveryear basis driven by continued growth in momentum banking and doubledigit deposit balance growth in our southeast markets commercial transaction deposits were down sequentially partially reflecting the anticipated movement of excess balances to higheryielding alternatives combined with some seasonal impacts as of yesterday total deposit balances have remained stable since midmay despite the fed rate hikes that occurred late in the second quarter as a result of our loan growth and deposit pricing discipline net interest income increased sequentially or excluding the impact of ppp ginnie mae and the securities prepayment penalty income as we indicated in the investor conference last month fees were softer for the quarter reflecting the impact of market conditions on debt capital markets mortgage and wealth management i am however quite pleased with the strength and diversification of our underlying fee growth engines in payments our gross treasury management revenue increased and credit card spend grew both compared to a year ago quarter in capital markets financial risk management revenue increased and ma advisory revenue grew the majority of which was sourced from existing middlemarket relationships in wealth management despite the market volatility personal asset management revenue was up yeartodate and we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of positive net aum flows we continue to manage expenses very diligently throughout the bank reflecting our multiyear continuous improvement discipline which has funded a significant portion of our organic growth and tech modernization strategies looking forward our proactive actions over the past several years with respect to our minimum wage and other employee retention strategies should provide us a buffer against inflation relative to peers with respect to capital we recently announced our stress capital buffer requirement from the feds stress test exercise the minimum under the regulatory capital rules our top priorities for capital deployment remain funding organic growth and paying a strong dividend we recently announced our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by up to in september subject to board approval and economic conditions given our robust loan growth and our desire to run the bank slightly above our capital targets in the current environment we do not anticipate executing share repurchases for the remainder of the year at this time while credit quality remains benign we remain cautious of the impact of the feds continued aggressive monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics could have on the economy over the past several years we have built fifth third to be resilient and to produce strong results under any market environment we have been consistent on fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 our strategic priorities and have had the discipline to fund investments in geographic expansion product innovation and technology through continuous improvement and pruning noncore businesses we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on highquality commercial relationships and on homeowners which are of our consumer portfolio we maintain the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in commercial real estate and in nonprime borrowers among our peers and of the mortgages on our balance sheet are fixed rate we have protected nii through a series of actions including our securities portfolio positioning adding cash flow hedges to protect the down rate scenario for the next decade and by maintaining a strong deposit franchise with a focus on primary relationships through the dividend and provide acquisitions we added fixed rate loan origination platforms that will be especially powerful in a lower rate environment our allowance for credit losses provides greater loss absorbency than virtually any of our peers under my leadership you should expect us to continue to make decisions with the long term in mind to hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do and to invest in product and service innovations that generate sustainable longterm value for customers and shareholders alike in closing on behalf of the entire leadership team id like to say thank you to our employees who are listening today as you know banks inhabit a special place in the communities where they operate and with that comes a special responsibility to be a proponent for positive change you work hard every day to live our purpose including delivering million meals to fight hunger across our footprint as part of fifth third day as well as positioning us to achieve our new billion environmental and social finance commitment i also want to thank you for the myriad of small things you do every day to improve our customers lives with that ill turn it over to jamie to provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and our current outlook james c leonard chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today our second quarter results were solid we generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and remained disciplined in managing our deposit costs expenses were once again wellcontrolled even though we continue to reinvest in our businesses fees did underperform our april expectations due to the market volatility but even with that softness we generated core ppnr growth of on a yearoveryear basis as a result we achieved a sub55 efficiency ratio and generated points of positive operating leverage from the second quarter of the acl ratio increased basis points sequentially to which includes a 4basis point impact from the dividend finance acquisition combined with million in net chargeoffs we recorded a million total provision for credit losses moving to the income statement net interest income of approximately billion increased sequentially and yearoveryear as tim mentioned the underlying nii growth was around compared to last quarter fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to higher market rates and half from the combination of investment portfolio growth and loan growth primarily in ci our interestbearing core deposit costs were wellcontrolled at just basis points this quarter up just basis points sequentially and helped drive the basis points of nim expansion during the quarter total reported noninterest income decreased sequentially and increased on an adjusted basis compared to the prior quarter we generated improved financial risk management card and processing gross treasury management fees and private equity income which was partially offset by weaker performance from our marketsensitive businesses including commercial capital markets and mortgage and the impact of higher treasury management earnings credit rates noninterest expense decreased compared to the prior quarter driven by a decline in compensation and benefits expense from the seasonal peak in the first quarter lower incentivebased comp in the current quarter due to market dynamics that impacted fees and overall continued expense discipline throughout the company expenses in the quarter included a million benefit related to the marktomarket impact of nonqualified deferred compensation which has a corresponding offset in security losses this compares to a million benefit in the prior quarter excluding the nonqualified deferred compensation impacts from both periods total noninterest expense decreased million or noninterest expense decreased compared to the yearago quarter moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases increased sequentially including held forsale loans total average loans increased compared to the prior quarter average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter primarily reflecting growth in ci loans commercial loan production remained robust throughout the franchise outperforming our original expectations our production and pipelines are the result of our strategic investments in talent as we continued to see strength in new quality relationship generation during the second quarter with muted payoffs and a increase in the revolver utilization rate to periodend commercial loans increased sequentially and compared to the yearago quarter average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter driven by residential mortgage and the dividend acquisition which are recorded in other consumer loans this growth was partially offset by a decline in home equity at quarter end total dividend loan balances were million reflecting our decision to hold some loans the dividend would have otherwise sold combined with their postclose production volume average core deposits were stable compared to the yearago quarter and decreased compared to the prior quarter including the impact of the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits this runoff was in line with our expectations and reflects our pricing discipline from our strong overall liquidity position compared to the yearago quarter average commercial transaction deposits decreased and average consumer transaction deposits increased reflecting our continued success growing consumer households given the improved entry points during the first and second quarters we deployed cash into the securities portfolio which resulted in second quarter average securities balance growth of approximately billion we completed net purchases of billion in securities during the second quarter compared to billion in the prior quarter fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 the higher than previously expected security purchases in the second quarter were the result of accelerating planned second half of purchases given the attractive entry points in late may and june we currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year we have continued to focus on adding duration and structure to the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows consequently our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increased from to at quarter end and our duration increased from to years moving to credit as tim mentioned credit remained healthy and in line with our previous expectations the npa ratio of basis points improved basis points sequentially with net chargeoffs of just basis points the ratio of earlystage delinquencies to days past due relative to loans was stable in the second quarter and the amount of loans days past due is less than half of what it was a year ago we continue to closely monitor the same areas we have previously discussed such as central business district hotels senior living and office cre we are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leveraged loan portfolio our acl build this quarter was million of which approximately was from strong loan growth including the million acl impact from the dividend acquisition and the remaining was attributable to worsening economic projections relative to march net of reductions in certain pandemicrelated qualitative adjustments given the incremental clarity on the economys ability to withstand geopolitical tensions and the pandemic fallout with vaccine efficacy and other measures we elected to return to our standard approach for scenario weights of to the baseline and to the downside and upside scenarios we believe our models are better suited to appropriately evaluate economic scenarios and outcomes from monetary tightening on our loan portfolio than on humanitarian crises such as pandemics and wars despite the scenario weight change we increased our reserves in specific portfolios such as cre where we continue to believe there are elevated risks our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains relatively stable with unemployment ending our threeyear reasonable and supportable period at around which is slightly weaker than our previous estimate additionally gdp growth and home price forecasts have weakened relative to our march forecast in both our baseline and downside scenarios our expectations incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains including aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated our june allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment moving to capital our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at compared to in the prior quarter the decline in capital was primarily due to strong rwa growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities and the impact of the dividend finance acquisition we expect to accrete capital to the area by year end given our strong earnings capacity and we will evaluate resuming buybacks after that time moving to our current outlook for the full year we continue to expect average total loan growth between and compared to or around excluding ppp and ginnie mae impacts reflecting strong pipelines and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 dividend finance is generating strong origination volumes we expect loan originations of around billion in the second half of which is more than our original estimates similarly provide loan production remains strong as we expect over billion in total production in dividend and provide together are expected to contribute a little more than of the total average loan growth for the year we expect average commercial loan growth of to or to excluding ppp we expect total average consumer loans to be stable in reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital we expect around billion in auto and specialty production for the full year which will still result in doubledigit growth in average indirect consumer secured balances in our outlook also assumes growth of approximately in other consumer loans reflecting the benefits of dividend finance shifting to the income statement we continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of to which will be a record year of revenue for fifth third given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of july which assumes a fed funds rate of by yearend we expect full year nii to increase to our outlook incorporates the impacts from runoff of the ppp and ginnie mae portfolios excluding those portfolios nii growth would be around our current outlook assumes average deposit balances decline a couple billion dollars in the third quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the second quarter runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits and seasonality and then return to growth in the fourth quarter since the onset of the rate hikes our deposit betas have been muted at lowsingle digits for the cycle to date we expect increases to our interestbearing core deposit costs to accelerate over the next two quarters due to the timing impact of deposit repricing lags from earlier hikes and continued aggressive rate hikes from the fed we continue to expect a deposit beta on the first basis points of rate hikes and a marginal beta of around to on the next basis points of rate hikes the ultimate impact to nii of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements balance sheet management strategies including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas we expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be down to in reflecting softer second quarter performance combined with the high probability of continued market volatility reflecting a more aggressive rate outlook including lower wealth and asset management mortgage and capital markets revenue as well as higher earnings credit rates offsetting strong gross treasury management fee growth despite the expected decline in capital markets revenue we expect full year capital markets revenue to be up nearly from the prepandemic levels which highlights the success weve had over the past few years in growing a diversified capital markets business we expect full year adjusted noninterest expense including the impacts of dividend finance to be stable to down compared to an improvement from our previous guide of up to we continue to strategically invest in our franchise which should result in low doubledigit growth in both technology and marketing expenses our outlook also assumes we add to new branches primarily in our highgrowth southeast markets in our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to per hour that went into effect on july fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 we expect these investments in our people platforms and franchise to be offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives reduced servicing expenses associated with the ginnie mae portfolio a decline in leasing expense given our lasalle solutions sale and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company as a result our full year total adjusted revenue growth combined with our expense outlook should generate points of improvement in the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage of around full year adjusted ppnr growth is expected to be to which is an improvement to the range compared to our april estimate reflecting the strong nii and expense outcomes partially offset by the marketrelated fee headwinds our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects the benefits of our ability to grow our customer base combined with our strong balance sheet management and expense discipline for the third quarter of we expect average total loan balances to increase sequentially reflecting to growth in commercial and stable consumer balances we expect our average securities portfolio to increase billion to billion reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during the second quarter shifting to the income statement we expect third quarter adjusted revenue growth of to compared with the second quarter we expect nii to be up to sequentially reflecting strong loan growth the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our balance sheet positioning we expect adjusted noninterest income to be down to compared to the second quarter we expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to the second quarter or up compared to the yearago quarter due to the acquisitions of provide and dividend finance excluding the second quarter nqdc benefits on expenses we expect noninterest expenses to increase around sequentially we continue to expect third quarter and full year net chargeoffs to be in the to basispoint range in summary with our balance sheet positioning ppnr growth engine and disciplined credit risk management we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to deliver strong performance in this type of environment with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call up for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of betsy graseck your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one on the buyback i just wanted to understand the thought process around when the reinstatement would be is that a function of a certain cet1 that youre looking to achieve and should we take it to mean that youll restart it in thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah betsy its jamie with given the environment that were operating in we as you can tell from our results are clearly positioning to be a little more cautious in this environment so we think accreting capital for the remainder of the year would be appropriate and then well evaluate resuming the buybacks in the first quarter of and certainly that would be outlookdependent but thats the current plan as we sit here today betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then on the deposit side i know you mentioned that deposits have been stable since the middle of may and its interesting that you didnt see that deposit outflow continue in june im just wondering is there a certain kind of depositor that you think will be that the outflow came from a type of depositor that will not be incented when the fed raises rates next week and the corollary here is if you have deposits stable but loan growth continues to be robust as youre indicating how are you thinking about funding that what type of borrowings are you looking to access thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah great question and ill start and turn it over to bryan for some additional color actually i think it was at your conference in early june that we talked about our plans on managing the balance sheet from a deposit standpoint and frankly for the past year yearandahalf we said wed like to see about billion of the deposits run off fortunately this quarter we were able to really manage the balance sheet almost exactly as we had intended again at your conference i think we said wed end the quarter at a loantodeposit ratio of and we finished fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 at so i do feel good about how we positioned the balance sheet and our ability to rightsize it and maybe with that turn it over to bryan to give a little more color on what weve seen on the outflows bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely we made the deliberate decision to not match market rates on certain high beta lower relationship depth customers as weve said all along we estimated about billion in excess balances in our commercial deposit book that we believed may not be sticky we do not have a lot of appetite for beta balances that want to be priced at fed funds or fed funds plus we were in a position to let about billion of these balances find a new home weve not lost customer relationships we know what it would take from a pricing perspective to get these balances back a decent amount of these funds ended up in our liquidity portal which gives our customers access to money market investments we also saw some heightened seasonality this year betsy as it relates to tax payments that were a little bit larger and we estimate the tax payment impact was another billion to billion of the runoff our commercial balances as we said were stable since midmay our consumer balances continue to be very stable and sticky and overall were pleased with our cost of total interestbearing core deposits of bps up only bps from the first quarter in terms of how were thinking about funding balance sheet growth from here were always going to be focused on being core deposit funded we have a lot of levers that we can continue to pull to grow deposits from here and were confident in our ability to do that that being said we will use shortterm borrowings as a mechanism to help us manage volatility in the balance sheet monthtomonth quartertoquarter and that includes funding opportunistic investment portfolio purchases that weve done additionally over time weve obviously run down our longterm debt portfolio well be looking to reenter the banknote market we do think its important for us to get some structure back into our liability framework and so thats something that well use as well but we continue to be confident with our ability to be core deposit funded were still sitting here at a loantodeposit ratio and so we feel very good right now about our overall positioning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys thanks for taking the question i just wanted to ask a followup question on deposits so it sounds like exclusive of the runoff or pardon me the continued impact of the decisions you made in the second quarter wed see sort of stable deposits or growth otherwise jamie what are you thinking in terms of what will grow are those consumer or commercial deposits as we look during the year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i talking on the consumer side first obviously we have a great retail franchise with tremendous products with momentum and the de novo plan and the southeast buildout so retail deposits we would expect to continue to grow in the back half of the year on the commercial side as i said in my prepared remarks well probably see a little bit more runoff a couple billion in the third quarter before we experience a return to growth in the fourth quarter and again thatll be driven by our treasury management business where i think weve presented at different conferences talking about how our tm business is bestinclass in the regional bank space in terms of tm fees as a percent of revenue or tm fees as a to loan commitments to help show that share of wallet and i think bryans comments are very important to realize that these werent lost relationships this was just excess money going to a better home and we expected it and from here itll just be business as usual timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp i think if i could add one thing there that maybe has been less fully appreciated i think to jamies point weve talked a lot about momentum banking weve talked about treasury management but among our investor peers we also have the highest percentage of our branch network that has been open less than five years and the majority of that time has not been in that environment where we were focused on deposit gathering out of those locations so much as we were household growth and otherwise and the byproduct of that is we think theres a lot of latent new deposit generation power that will come out of the call it de novos that have been opened in the southeast and in addition that are going to come between the second half of this year and the first quarter of next year that will provide an additional kick in terms of core deposit generation above and beyond what were getting out of momentum banking and the treasury management business r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then if i could ask separate one just maybe jamie your thoughts on sort of drivers of the continued weakness in fees in the third quarter i think some of them are probably i think logically what they would be but would just be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of puts and takes james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think in this environment the accelerated rate hikes and magnitude of the rate hikes just continue to weigh on the ratedependent fee businesses so the outlook for mortgage capital markets and tm earnings credits are the biggest drivers of the change in our fee outlook as tim mentioned in the prepared remarks the fee equivalent growth has actually been very strong its just as we get that additional nii benefit from the rate hikes we give a portion of it back in the rates paid on earnings credit so from here i would expect the strong consumer household growth to help carry the day on a combination of card and deposit service charges but as a reminder we are implementing or did implement july the elimination of the nsf fee so that will weigh a little bit on the back half of the year fee guide fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 and then on wealth and asset management fees weve done a great job of new customer acquisition as well as our aum net inflows but obviously the market headwinds have an impact on the fee revenue there so that again is in the updated guide and then commercial banking is really a fascinating tale of two cities where our ability to help customers manage different exposures that they want to hedge whether its rates commodities or fx along with our institutional brokerage business is just growing 30plus percent but the disruption in the capital markets having a big impact on the corporate bond fees and loan syndication fees and we dont really in our outlook expect significant improvement in the capital markets activity in the back half of the year and i guess when you add up our fee outlook in total we made about billion in the first half of the year were saying well make billion plus or minus a little bit in the back half of the year and the tra of that million of growth the tra is half of it so at least for now thats how we see the back half of the year playing out r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you guys very much operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi tim hi jamie timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hello gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc technical difficulty for the organization can you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp gerard i apologize you cut out right at the beginning there could you start the question over yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure can you hear me now tim timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp we can yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 okay thank you jamie you pointed out some very strong loan growth numbers for the commercial and industrial portfolio can you guys share with share with us where youre seeing this growth both geographically and by industry and then as and in addition to that i assume youre probably going to expect to see utilization rates go up as well as that growth comes in james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah ill take the second part of the question first when it comes to the line utilization and im glad you asked the question what we saw in the second quarter was that in total line utilization moved up point and were guiding for the rest of the year for that to actually be stable so well see how things play out and in the second quarter the movement in the line utilization the biggest group that moved was actually the middle market group was up several points and so that was nice to see from a production standpoint it was pretty widespread and again a very strong quarter of middle market production i think tim mentioned several geographies in his prepared remarks but cincinnati carolinas florida its a consistent story for us where a little bit of softness in east michigan northern ohio is more than offset by strong performance in the rest of the midwest and the southeast and then from a vertical perspective the renewables team continue and energy continues to go very robust as well as our tmt business so we feel good about frankly the ability to acquire new customers in this environment the sales teams with the rm expansion play out west as well as in the southeast has worked very well were just mindful of what appears to us to be a slowing economy and therefore were trimming a little bit on the edges but frankly the core is performing very well and you see that in the results this quarter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question and pivoting to credit quality for a moment obviously you guys have very strong credit quality and you built up the reserves as you pointed out in this quarter and i understand that with the numbers being so small with you and your peers one or two loans can move the numbers so with that as a backdrop can you give us some color on two questions on the commercial portfolio first is the transfer to nonaccrual status that was an increase of about million this quarter versus million in the prior quarter just any color there and second i believe you had a higher chargeoff number in that category as well at million versus million in the prior quarter and again i emphasize the numbers one loan can move those numbers since theyre so low but im just curious richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah hey gerard its richard thanks for the question youve described it in your question whats happening were at levels that are so low theres a little bit of balancing along the bottom porpoising if you will the change in both npa and chargeoffs was a handful with a handful of loans that it just finally rolled to a place where we needed to take a more direct action in terms of making them nonaccrual and charging them off i think overall the portfolio continues to perform as you point out very well well inside our appetite and were very pleased about where we sit today both today and then also with the outlook in front of us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning guys timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi as a followup to gerards question on the on credit the increase that you just talked about in the nonaccruals and chargeoffs in the commercial side so theres a handful of loans any commonality in terms of industries or businesses that would help give us a little bit of color there and then separately are you seeing any signs of emerging stress anywhere within your portfolio worth noting i know youre keeping an eye on commercial real estate and your leverage portfolio as well thanks richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah no commonality by industry in those names i think certainly the economic headwinds of inflation labor supply chain were elements to the those were the common elements but different industries different segments but they ultimately put pressure on cash flow and that caused us to able to take different action broadly in terms of pressure i mean its the same thing weve talked about weve talked about office that continues to be challenged senior living again thats another place where you see a disconnect between cost inflation and what they can get from a reimbursement rate perspective and then what were watching are places where changes in consumer behavior are shifting whether its from durables and discretionary to consumables and nondiscretionary but no large segments theres a little bit of idiosyncratic movement across the portfolio but nothing major that causes us any concern john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right great and then and my followup is somewhat related on credit to a degree the your rationale of pullback in auto i know youve been talking about that can you just give us a kind of a reminder of the reason of pullback what youre seeing is it more just about the competition in the space or are you seeing something on the credit front that is driving that decision because we did see we are having some other banks talk about that pullback as well and then separately dont know if you have your criticized asset trend or change that you can give us color on for the quarter thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah sure john thanks for the question in terms of auto when we started the year our forecast was about billion in total production for a combination of auto plus the specialty business rv and marine were now expecting to do about billion in total in that asset class and so the billion of reduction is solely driven by the returns dynamic in that sector where several large players have certainly if its not irrational its certainly very aggressive pricing and therefore we dont want to compete on an indirect asset class at such low spreads so spreads have dropped to levels that were reminiscent of when we did the pullback five or six years ago so the good news for us is we keep the dealer relationships were continuing to monitor performance we have spreads back up towards our target level and feel good about the production from a credit quality perspective as well as the spreads but its just not an asset class you want to grow with singledigit returns on capital in terms of the credits they were fairly stable in the quarter not a lot to report there john pancari q analyst evercore isi great all right jamie thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies company oh hey guys good morning just following up on the deposit side so hearing your earlier comments about the purposeful outflows just wondering if you can give us a sense of like are we at the right bottoming spot on the nonoperational side and given the good start to deposit betas where your interestbearing costs were only up basis points can you just give us updated thoughts on how youre expecting betas to trend from here relative to james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure ken usdin q analyst jefferies company your previous expectations thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think from an endofperiod perspective weve accomplished what we wanted to accomplish on the nonoperational excess deposits so again therell be an average effect in the third quarter but overall we said year and a half ago wed like to get billion of the excess out i think weve done that and frankly yearoveryear deposits are flat so its not shouldnt be a big surprise to people that we were able to rightsize it and again the loantodeposit ratio at would love to get it into the mid over a period of several years but that would certainly be driven more by continued loan growth as opposed to any more deposit runoff fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 in terms of the betas it is difficult i think to track betas by quarter when the fed is moving in such big chunks but how we see it playing out is that wed have a fourth quarter beta of the month of december would be and then by the time we get to midyear next year the trail effect because in our forecast we have the fed going to and then stopping for a little bit longer than normal period of time and therefore therell be a little bit of that drift effect as the lag catches up so that the ultimate beta ends up being on the basis points of rate hikes so from a rates paid perspective it looks something in the area of the basis points this quarter it goes to mid in the third mid in the fourth and then drifts to the mid by the second quarter of thats how we think this will play out and then well continue to see deposit growth beginning in the fourth quarter and thereafter ken usdin q analyst jefferies company all right thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo your line is open timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i really like your slide so your nims up basis points linked quarter and basis points is due to rates i get that basis points is due to securities it looks like your timing was good in late may and june but only basis point due to loan growth so i guess i think about the remixing of the portfolio into higheryielding securities yes but even higher yielding loans which doesnt show up so i guess on the one hand your deposits are down periodend so what was the margin on those deposits like you were i guess youve been saying thats really lowmargin stuff youre not staying around for deposit beta deposits so i get that thats probably helping you running that off on the other hand why dont you have more pickup from loan growth are you just originating lowyielding loans or what bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp no i wouldnt say were originating lowyielding loans the mix of a lot of our loan growth in our ci book just given the floating rate nature of that portfolio and where its been pricing in has been relatively neutral in terms of the nim impact but it does drive a decent amount of nii some of the consumer assets that weve been talking about especially the dividend assets in particular its just a late quarter impact so youll start to see some pickup from those in the future as those balances have a bigger average balance impact but overall we do expect to see some pickup the we will continue to see nii benefits just because of the asset sensitivity of our commercial floating rate portfolio and well see some nice kind of drive from here and our nim will continue to increase throughout the year we would expect to end the year in a kind of a to 335ish range from a nim perspective in the fourth quarter so a lot of earnings power is still to come fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then in terms of your expense control tim this is your i guess as you said your first earnings call as ceo so you probably want to get the guidance right and you guys are guiding third quarter for higher revenues and only higher core expenses actually if you look at first quarter to third quarter your run rate nii should be going up by onefourth based on your guidance even while your expenses and your guide is to be lower so i guess how confident are you in that and what is your incremental profit margin and why would it be so much better than your existing profit margin timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp all right yeah mike thanks for the question i mean to answer narrowly very in terms of our level of confidence on our ability to manage expenses i think the driver here when you think about our business right the people costs are a huge share of our overall expense base and weve been i think very public about the efforts that we have made over the course of the past few years to drive not only a culture of continuous expense discipline but also a real focus on leveraging the technology investments we have been making to drive automation and reduce the unit costs associated with core processing activities so our fte count on a is down about right now which is a big driver of the savings in terms of expense management and thats helping us so its less a dynamic around the margin on the incremental business so much as it is us continuing to make progress on the fixed cost base and the variable costs associated with our existing business activity james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and mike i would say yes your math on the nii is very good and we are highly confident in that i would say if there are two things fifth third is extremely good at one is balance sheet management and you see that in the nim expansion and as bryan mentioned the continued expansion over the course of the year and then were also very efficient from an expense standpoint and what you have happening is that as there is fee weakness back to your profit margin question as there is fee weakness fees have a higher cost of delivery than obviously nii nii for the most parts dropping straight to the bottom line and so thats certainly an element of helping the efficiency ratio but in addition to that all of the expense savings initiatives we have going on in the company as tim mentioned yearoveryear were down people if you exclude the acquisitions and dispositions and just sequentially were down people exclusive of the acquisitions and the dispositions and thats rightsizing our mortgage business closing one of our fulfillment sites rightsizing the indirect auto and specialty business given the slowdown in volumes and then all of the lpa enhancements with reducing it and ops and the branch closure benefits from the first quarter so we have a lot going on underneath to help provide those tailwinds on expenses but then were very mindful of continuing to invest and so in the third quarter in the guide you have an increase in technology and marketing and then a little bit of noise from the nqdc assuming it comes out at in the third quarter which is the driver why expenses will be up to sequentially but overall feel very good about our ability to deliver an efficient balance sheet and an efficient income statement fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc just two followup questions for me please jamie how should we think about how youre thinking of the securities portfolio from here do you feel like thats something that you will continue to build especially after deposit growth comes back or do you think it could be a source of funding as deposit pricing accelerates james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i would expect the investment portfolio to be stable from here i would not expect to be selling down the portfolio to fund loan growth it obviously in a crisis could be a great source of liquidity but that would probably be through more collateral usage at fhlb or backing backstopping public funds deposits but overall id expect it to be stable and the yield our guide for the back half of the year on yield is in the range both for the third quarter as well as on a full year basis so that yield guide is up a bit as mike pointed out with some fortuitous timing on the additional leverage weve added erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and maybe this is for richard ill give you the cecl question near the end of the hour what could you remind us when you built your acl to in what was the unemployment rate that you were assuming and the reason i ask this is at acl if we think about the scenario different scenarios of chargeoff in a mild recession for fifth third taking into account the deal thing thats been going on it feels like in a mild downturn your acl is in the right place and any guidance on this would be great because obviously everybodys now anticipating some sort of downturns sooner rather than later james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp hey erika its jamie ill take that one and ill answer your question a little bit differently than how you asked it because the only piece of data i have on the history is the unemployment level versus day one so our current scenario for the baseline has unemployment at versus the day one reserve in years one two and three were and so versus day one unemployment is a little better but the big driver of our variance to day one reserves is that the gdp outlook and collateral values both for housing and fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 auto are worse and then obviously the rate environment is significantly worse which in the modelling puts pressure on corporate profits so were sitting a little bit elevated over the day one levels but to your point we think that is a prudent place to be and frankly versus the last quarter the scenarios are certainly worse and so gdp erosion housing pricing is worse interest rates higher so from our standpoint when you have a period of strong loan growth like we did in the second quarter you have eroding economic forecasts you should have a cecl build and then on top of that we have the dividend acquisition effect which that million or so of the acl build on related to the dividend finance production is something that will continue as we commented on strong production expectations for dividend until that portfolio reaches a state of maturity and so those acl builds ultimately well see what the loss content is to your question on should there be a mild recession the moodys baseline scenario that we utilize while worse is not a broadbased persistent decline in economic activity that would result in a recession but again its certainly worse than last quarter and certainly worse than the day one build timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah and i think with that being said if we sound more cautious right i think we probably are just based on what i read in here we try to be really consistent especially as it relates to the alignment of what we talk about worrying about and how thats reflected in the actions and how we run the company and to try to be realistic about whats in front of us like jamie said that you look at whats going on in the current environment erika and i things are theres a lot of things to feel optimistic about and in our particular portfolio not only do we as credit obviously has been great and ncos are low and npas and delinquencies actually came down the ratios there came down quarter overquarter we are very mindful of the broader backdrop in attempting to gauge how to position the company for the next to to months and at least from my point of view if the goal is to have a company thats great through the cycle you always have to be asking yourself what happens if youre wrong right and if were wrong in this case and were being too cautious maybe we miss point or of loan growth that we otherwise could have gotten right but thats against the backdrop where weve done very well on that measure maybe we buy back stock a quarter or two later than we would have otherwise and then the acl drifts down naturally as the scenario outlook changes right but if were right to be cautious on the other hand the actions weve taken as it relates to the securities portfolio the swaps the total loss absorption fifth third has relative to peers and the fact that we did not take the benefit that were getting from nii and spend it in the form of different sorts of investments and otherwise are going to pay off very handsomely in terms of performance so one way or the other like even against this backdrop i think our return metrics look really good on a relative basis ppnr is going to be up highteens on a yearoveryear basis i think we feel really good about how the bank is positioned fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning obviously bought a lot of securities and added some swaps this quarter and hear you on keeping securities relatively flat rest of the year but just kind of as you step back would you consider yourself fully invested as you think about i guess securities plus mortgage plus swaps or holding deposits flat obviously james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i would say the investment portfolio is wellpositioned and at the level that we would like to manage it long term now with that said if we see great opportunities could we pull forward one quarter or two quarters of cash flow which is currently running about billion a quarter im not going to tie my hands and say i wouldnt take advantage of great opportunities but as i sit here today and what rates have done we feel really good about just stability from here matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right yeah seems like you have pretty good timing with the spike in rates in the quarter so thank you james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks matt operator your final question comes from christopher marinac your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning wanted to ask about the need to protect for lower interest rates jamie is that something that you spend much time thinking about and is that something that took place james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah thats the story of my life right now because in our outlook we expect the fed hikes to the level and then i saw a research piece the other day that talked about on average or the median of the fed cuts begin four months after the last hike now we expect the fed in order to tamp down inflation is really focused on slowing the economy so they probably hold for a longer period of time than that median and hold at that whatever the peak level is and so frankly that could tip things over into a recession maybe not but at a minimum there will be rate cuts down the road and rate cuts are ultimately the most detrimental activity to a banks balance sheet if left fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 unprotected and therefore everything weve done over the past couple of years has been building for that time that the fed does move and we have a rate decline and so weve added duration to the portfolio again this quarter its up to years we increased the bullet locked out cash flows to we grew the portfolio to billion we added billion in swaps and then as tim pointed out in his comments weve added some fixed rate loan platforms to our business model and that should also be helpful should rates decline so yes we spend a lot of time on that and i think we have a very very good team to be able to help manage through that environment and certainly deposit generation activities are very helpful especially from the retail footprint as those are the lowcost stable funding that banks like to enjoy christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thats great
