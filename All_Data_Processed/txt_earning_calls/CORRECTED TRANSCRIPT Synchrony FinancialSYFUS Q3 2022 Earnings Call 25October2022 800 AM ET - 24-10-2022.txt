level synchrony achieved doubledigit growth in our diversified value health wellness digital and home auto platforms and singledigit growth in our lifestyle platform more specifically home auto purchase volume was higher driven by strength in home furniture and autorelated spend as well as the impact of inflationary conditions on inventory gasoline and automotive parts in diversified value purchase volume increased driven by higher outofpartner spend partner penetration growth and strong retailer performance lifestyle purchase volume grew reflecting an industry specific rebound within luxury and higher outofpartner spend more broadly the yearoveryear increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected growth across the platform we experienced greater customer engagement including higher active accounts and spend per account among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches the increase in health wellness purchase volume was driven

demonstrate momentum purchase volume on these products grew versus last year and represented about of our total purchase volume for the quarter when tracking average transaction value and frequency trends across the major outof partner spend categories of these products we continue to see robust consumer demand across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories as we would expect there have been some modest seasonal shifts among a few of the major categories in favor of more educationrelated spend and less travel and entertainment spend otherwise transaction values in gas and autorelated spend have continued to show growth in line with gas price trends and inflation while grocery spend value is running relatively steady with the last few months the more recent pullback in gas prices appears to have contributed to a slight acceleration in broader discretionary and nondiscretionary spend with categories like clothing home furnishing and repair bill pay and autorelated spending experiencing higher transaction value at similar frequency putting this all together the daily and monthly touch points that synchrony has with our customers across a broad range of purchases tells us that consumer health remains strong and supportive of demand whether theyre taking care of everyday essentials like gas groceries and medical expenses or making more episodic investments like buying a new mattress or replacing refrigerator our customers are responsibly accessing financing for their needs maximizing the value they seek and managing well overall as they navigate the

over to brian to discuss the third quarter financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys strong third quarter results reflect a continued strength of consumer and broadbased demand for the wide range of products and services that our ecosystem seamlessly delivers purchase volume of billion reflected a increase compared to last year or on a core basis continued strength in consumer spend coupled with some moderation in the payment rate contributed to higher average balances per account versus last year and growth in ending receivables or on a core basis our dual and cobranded cards accounted for of core receivables and increased from the prior year net interest income increased to billion primarily reflecting a increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables partially offset by the impacts of the portfolios sold during the second quarter of on a core basis interest and fees increased payment rate for the third quarter when normalizing for the prior year impact of portfolios recently sold was approximately basis points lower than last year while still approximately basis points higher than our historical average net interest margin was in the third quarter a yearoveryear increase of basis points the primary driver of this increase was a basis point improvement in loan yield which contributed basis points to net interest margin stronger liquidity portfolio yield also contributed basis points these improvements in our loan and liquidity portfolio yields were partially offset by the anticipated increase in interestbearing liability costs which increased basis points to in the quarter and reduced net interest margin by basis points the mix of interestearning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly basis points rsas were billion in the third quarter and of average receivables the million yearoveryear decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the portfolios sold in the second quarter of and program performance provision for credit losses was million for the quarter the yearoveryear increase reflected the impact of a growthdriven million reserve build this year compared to million reserve release in the prior year other income decreased million primarily reflecting the impact of higher loyalty costs other expenses increased to billion reflecting higher employee costs and other expenses total other expense included million of additional marketing growth reinvestment of q2s million gain on sale proceeds as detailed in the appendix of our presentation we expect that the gain on sale and the reinvestment made in the second third and fourth quarters of this year will be eps neutral for the full year our efficiency ratio for the third quarter was compared to last year excluding the effects of the gain on sale reinvestment the efficiency ratio would have been and approximately basis point improvement versus last year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 putting it all together synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share for the third quarter we also generated a return on average assets of and return on tangible common equity of these strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem synchrony is consistently able to meet a broad range of our customers needs while maintaining cost and credit discipline which allows us to sustainably grow while delivering consistent riskadjusted returns next ill cover our key credit trends on slide we continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the credit spectrum of our portfolio the vast majority of our borrowers continue to perform consistently with or better than performance we continue to monitor borrower behavior closely and note that consumers are still slowly working through excess savings levels from peak levels the external data we track indicates due to the combination of summer spending and inflationary conditions the proportion of customers who received stimulus payments and have since spent the entire amount has increased approximately percentage points since july now around compared to a few months earlier the remaining of the customers still have a portion or all of the stimulus still saved when tracking consumer savings balance trends by tiers to to and balances greater than the external data suggests that during the course of the third quarter the top two tiers of stimulus customers experienced balance reductions of approximately but have begun to rebound while the bottom tier seen roughly in runoff meanwhile labor markets continue to be robust and portfolio payment rates remain elevated compared to our historical fiveyear average this suggests to us that borrowers still remain wellpositioned to support robust demand for goods and services while responsibly meeting their financial obligations turning to synchronys portfolio our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and our 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year our third quarter net chargeoff rate was versus last year this basis point yearoveryear increase generally reflected the gradual progression of our credit losses towards our portfolio underwriting target of to our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was down basis points from the in the second quarter moving on to another source of synchronys strength our capital liquidity and funding deposits at the end of third quarter reached billion an increase of billion compared to last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources increased by billion altogether deposits represented of our funding while securitized and unsecured debt represented and respectively at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion or of our total assets consistent with last year we maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least deposits we expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth and well maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 generally speaking we manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral that said as we continue to grow our deposit base and actively encourage a rotation from savings to cds were actively extending our deposit duration as a result we expect to be slightly liability sensitive over the near term while we continue to manage interest rate through term maturities its also important to note that through the mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level synchronys rsa will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business moving on to discuss synchronys strong capital position note that we previously elected to take the benefit of the seasonal transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies as a result starting this past january of and ending in january synchrony makes an annual transitional adjustment of approximately basis points to our regulatory capital metrics the impact to the cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet with that in mind we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis lower than last years level of the tier capital ratio is under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year we continued our track record of robust capital returns in the third quarter in total we returned billion to shareholders through million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends as of quarter end our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending june was billion synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return considerable capital to our shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions finally please note that our full year outlook is outlined on slide which has been updated in the following ways ending loan receivable growth versus last year is now expected to be approximately or more up from 10plus previously the net chargeoffs will be approximately for the full year down from our prior expectation of and rsa as a percentage of average loan receivables will be approximately for the full year down from previously turning to net interest margin and operating expenses net interest margin will be approximately up from approximately and incorporates our latest view on the interest rate environment and funding needs operating expenses should continue their quarterly run rate of approximately billion excluding the impact of the gain on sale reinvestment plans which are detailed in the appendix of our earnings presentation to conclude synchrony remains very wellpositioned to achieve our longterm financial operating targets as the environment normalizes ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian synchronys third quarter financial performance highlighted the benefits of our highly diversified business across spend categories product offerings and distribution channels and through our evergrowing synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings

outcomes that matter most for our many stakeholders utility and value for our customers sales and loyalty for our partners and providers and sustainable growth and consistent risk adjusted returns to our shareholders with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions we have our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial hey ryan brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so brian the fourth quarter net chargeoff guide implies a little bit of a ramp can you maybe just talk about what is driving that and then second you had said in the past that youd expect to approach more normal levels by the end of call it and obviously that implies a decent ramp from here can you maybe just talk about how you see credit progressing in the intermediate term and what does this mean for the allowance thanks synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks ryan so again the guide for the quarter better than our expectation to be honest with you as we exited out of the third quarter delinquency ph and the loss ones are a little bit better than our expectation and when we look at the attributes inside of the portfolio by credit grade theyre performing still better than so the credit normalization ramp that we see is really on target from what we had projected and really view that well get back to that mean loss rate as we exit out of absent a significant change in the macroeconomic event when you think about the fourth quarter i mean when you look at our 90day plus past due delinquencies at billion thats going to lead to a rise in chargeoff dollars but not unexpected and not anything that we look at and say that were concerned about relative to an accelerating credit normalization trend so we feel good about credit we feel good about the portfolio distribution that we have and we see migration back to levels including in the nonprime population so again were on target absent a significant change in the macroeconomic event when you then parlay that into reserves right when you think about the reserves we have in the books now clearly we look at the unemployment rate when you have credit normalization that unemployment rate is projected to be higher in the core model and then we have overlays for i would say more conservative macro environment so we believe that the reserve postings going forward again should be more growthdriven than anything else which i think is what youre seeing here in the third quarter ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color and then the margin is holding up better than expected given the pace of rate hikes but brian you did reiterate the balance sheet as somewhat liability sensitive so can you maybe just talk about what is assumed in terms of loan and deposit betas and then if you look out over the remainder of the rising rate cycle where do you see the margin and betas going in a fed fund scenario just given your balance sheet positioning thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so if you think about the betas that weve experienced todate so if i look at high yield savings roughly around when you think about your 12month cd rate when you look at that relative to a swap its between and i would expect ryan to see that tick up a little bit say high yield savings around and you may see 12month cds go to around ph again i think a lot of its going to depend upon the competition in the market and what funding needs people have we need to remain competitive with both our digital partners as well as money market funds with regard to that so we continue to be encouraged by the strong franchise weve been able to grow deposits after a couple of years of actually shrinking deposits to manage the margins so were encouraged with the franchise and what were building there and i think weve been opportunistic with regard to when we access the wholesale market and how we really operate inside both the cd and high yield savings we swung to a liability sensitive were a little bit more this quarter not materially more but a little bit more but i think locking in certificates of deposits for to months is going to set us up nicely for synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 again we will be back in january when we see where we exit out of from a fed funds perspective and what the fed anticipates a terminal rate would be and well be back to provide some color on how to think about that in next year ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you ryan brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks ryan operator we have our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks brian hoping you could kind of talk about as you think about that credit normalization obviously one of the features of your pl thats somewhat unique is the rsa and how that reflects and weve had some kind of puts and takes over the last several years and good performance this quarter but can you talk a little bit about how as that normalizes how you would expect that rsa to behave over the course of brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe again i think as weve said and i know people have been frustrated with it the rsa is acting as a design so when chargeoffs kind of troughed out the rsa peaked now we start to see the chargeoff dollars rising partially offset by higher interest and fees but really seeing that flow through the rsa which gave us a sub rsa for this quarter and most certainly weve incorporated that into the guide into the fourth quarter again i think well be back in january to kind of give you that trajectory there is nothing that we look at moshe that says as you move back towards that normalized mean loss rate of that were going to be outside of the traditional rsa range of to so from a chargeoff perspective its acting as designed and should go back clearly i think were going to have to look at how net interest margin and program performance works but again we think generally youre going to see the rsa rate trend down as charge offs trend up brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial moshe the only thing i would add there is you also have to remember that that also means that payment rates going to moderate and youll have some topline benefit as well in interest and fees moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 perfect thanks and just as a followup i mean you did highlight both the percentage of the business and the growth rates kind of in your cobrands and dual card portfolios maybe could you talk a little bit about whether how the plan over the next several years is the plan to grow that does that grow faster how do you think about that contributor to synchronys overall growth rate brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look ill start and ask brian to comment i think look we try and grow all of our products as disciplined as we can achieving riskadjusted returns so i think weve seen really good growth on dual and cobranded cards some of thats new program launches some of that is new value props that we have launched and refreshed in the last year or two we really like that product its a great product to graduate customers into over time so if we start them in a private label card with a relatively modest line once we get comfortable with their creditworthiness and payment behavior et cetera and we get to know them and we get a sense for whether or not theyre willing to spend outside of the brand then we obviously look at them and upgrade them into a dual card so thats the strategy weve had for years it works really well both from a risk standpoint as well as a return standpoint i dont know brian if you want to brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial add anything brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the only thing id highlight brian you talked quite a bit about the multiproduct approach and having the right product for our customers and when you look at our partner basis whether its paypal venmo verizon walgreens and some of the other core retailers tjx sams that product just fits nicely into the portfolio and we do it in a line structure very different than our competitors so it allows us to control the risk in the portfolio and really optimize the balance brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial and frankly some of our best most engaged customers are customers who earn rewards outside of the brand bring those points back into the brand and our partners really they really value that those are longterm very valued customers moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 yeah brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator we have our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw kathryn harmon miller a senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial actually vanessa i think mihir bhatia from bamls teed up operator please proceed mihir mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc yeah hi good morning and thank you for taking my question i wanted to ask just about the underwriting standards in general have you tightened i mean i was just looking at driving the lower new accounts this quarter and just trying to understand what could be driving that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so let me go to the latter part the lower new accounts is really the portfolios sold during the second quarter if you look at on a core basis which strips out those portfolios were up and generated again million new accounts from an underwriting standpoint we have not seen in the portfolio attributes which would require us to take kind of measures kind of measures across the entire portfolio that said mihir we always are making refinements and changes to our underwriting standards we look at channels partners and performance so again we dont see attributes where we need to take a broadbased action but we are most really taking some small refinements i also want to go back to whats really unique about our underwriting and what weve done over the last several years is we have not relied upon credit to be the primary driver of growth so we havent changed our underwriting standards we havent gone out like a lot of other issuers to use that and credit lines in order to get new accounts we have people coming to us because theyre the most loyal customers of our partners and really want to engage with the value propositions and the brand and because we get so much data from our partners because were using unique attributes which we highlighted in prism at our investor day and then you combine that you combine those attributes and roll them together we think were making actually hopefully smarter decisions on risk at the end of the day and not having to take more risks and again we see nothing that today says we need to tighten across the board but again we have the abilities and the tools to manage that risk appropriately if we see a change in the portfolio brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial we try to minimize the ups and downs for our partners as well so to brians points when times are really good we dont dig a lot deeper and take advantage of that and then put ourselves in a position where we have to pull synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 way back coming out of that i think that consistency and that discipline is important not just for our own risk and returns but obviously for our partners too so theyre not feeling the ups and downs so we try to stay as consistent as possible brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial and just one final point to that mihir just adding on to brians point if you go back we provided a chart before if you look at the volatility in credit through cycles were just generally less volatile because of the way in which our line structures are in these underwriting standards and most certainly you can go back we shown the chart a number of different times and its because the severity and the consistency kind of gives us a competitive advantage mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then maybe just kind of following along with what you said brian about being there for your partners has that conversation started changing now and particularly i guess what im asking is around competitive intensity for new partner signups and are there particular opportunities maybe even with existing partners to grow products just given the pullback in some of the valuations particularly on the fintech side are you seeing some partners coming back to you saying hey maybe you can add this product just like just trying to understand how those conversations are going and if theres any opportunities in just the competitive environment right now for partners thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure so look i would start by saying its still a pretty competitive environment out there i think given what has happened in some of the fintech space youve seen a little bit of a pullback there maybe a little bit less aggressive in terms of offers and rates et cetera but what ill tell you is that as were out targeting our partners and prospects whats really resonating right now is the multiproduct strategy being able to offer buy now pay later pay in migrating to other products in our portfolio because i think one of the things that our partners have seen is that depending on the consumer depending on the product thats being purchased and frankly depending on the macroeconomic environment pay in gets a lot more expensive in an environment where rates are rising at the pace that theyre rising and so i think partners have taken a step back and now theyre trying to rationalize their point of sale and saying hey look how do i optimize this for the economy that im operating in for my consumer for what theyre buying and whats great is we can go in and say look for this product we think its a 12month sixmonth promotional financing product with an opportunity to upgrade them into a revolving product down the road thats pretty powerful thats pretty powerful because it gives them optionality and it helps them manage the expense side of the equation too in terms of what those financing offers costs them and what it takes out of their margins so were seeing really good traction in terms of discussions that were having out there both with our existing partners as well as new prospects mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mihir operator thank you our next question is from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess first question brian wenzel on your comments related to being liability sensitive understandably might have some headwinds on the nim but im just trying to think about nii because youre yield is obviously benefiting from rates but also higher revolve can you just help us parse through that and think about nii going forward brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure good morning sanjay so when you think about nim if i think about it sequentially for the quarter we picked up about basis points of prime benefit in the yields we also picked up about basis points benefits relating to merchant discounts so when you look at the prime impact of basis points merchant discount of basis points some of the investment portfolios on the cash position picking up basis points we largely offset the interest expense increase so generally neutral the important part though sanjay is when i look at the prime rate benefit the effective prime for the quarter was we tend to be a little bit slower the way our cards bill out and change aprs so we have some more room to increase that as we move into the fourth quarter when you think about the merchant discount pricing were about to of that price through to our partners and thats something that we try to be measured on and deal with competition so we think that from a margin perspective most certainly i think in the guide in the fourth quarter we should get those tailwinds kind of coming through again some of the portfolio will be resetting as you got a full quarter price for some of the cds and things like that that we put on in the third quarter as well as the increase in the high yield savings but we feel good about it again i think locking up at these rates if you believe that the interest rate cycle is going to continue to move up here in the latter part of the fourth quarter into next year having those certificate of deposits and being a little bit liability sensitive right now should benefit us next year as we move forward again well be back in january with probably some more comprehensive thoughts on it sanjay but thats kind of how to think about it so we got a lift when i go back to the revolve rate and late fees going up with delinquencies partially offset by reversals but again the prime rate is flowing through sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then maybe a question for brian doubles just following up on what mihir was asking earlier i mean i kind of asked this question last quarter but you have another quarter of a dislocation among fintech valuation synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 youve had the cfpb obviously come in with some comments on regulatory actions potentially for buy now pay later im just curious if thats presenting an opportunity for you guys do you feel like there might be some offensive moves you can make i mean just broadly speaking maybe you could just address that a little bit more thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure sanjay look i think were absolutely playing offense i do think there has been a little bit of a check up in the market now partners are thinking about these products and how they want to design their point of sale for the future and this is where again we think the multiproduct strategy wins over the long term and ill comment quickly on just the regulatory environment we think also favors us i mean we are heavily regulated today as you know and we would certainly advocate for a level playing field that doesnt exist today so i think to the extent that some of these products around the periphery become more regulated and more scrutinized then i think thats a net positive for us and so i think theres a few things that kind of play to our advantage for the first time in a few years with valuations where they are maybe that presents some attractive ma opportunities if there is something on the technology side that would be faster to buy than to build so thats something that were always looking at weve got a very active ma screen i think were also very disciplined very focused on valuations and that was one of the things that we didnt see over the last couple of years was attractive entry points but again thats something that we run a very active process on and well continue to look at but very disciplined around valuation and impact to eps so sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay operator our next question is from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks for taking my questions and brian you did get into this you were talking of you guys gave us good information about the different platforms and you talked a little bit about the customers different use of the products but im wondering i mean just where we are in the cycle given that were kind of moving through an inflationary environment that i think is kind of new to all of us synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 is there any kind of behavioral aspects of the customers that are changing that you think changes the value proposition thinking about the different uses like dualpurpose versus cobrand versus the npl are you seeing shifts in that and does that give you any indications for what to kind of look out for in the intermediate term brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah let me start and then brian may add some commentary john when we look at the consumer spending behavior patterns were not seeing very much change theyre being very consistent they are making choices where people are saying okay maybe im spending a little bit more for grocery or gasoline and im spending a little bit less on te but were seeing very much consistency as we think about average transaction values and frequency consistently throughout the year and we look at it by credit grade by platform we look at the world composition components so everything seems to be consistent so the customer itself is not migrating or changing their spending behavior patterns we continue to see just tremendous positive growth relative to our millennial and gen zs they make about of our sales theyre our fastestgrowing cohort at call it to basis points higher than the company average so they continue to view that again the value propositions have to resonate with the customers and we continue to think that in the multiproduct and distribution model that we have we just think is attractive so we have not seen the consumer from a spending behavior pattern change significantly again making smarter decisions but overall level of spend not really changing brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i think what were starting to see on the merchant side and i think brian covered the consumer really well on the merchant side i think you will see we have started to see and well continue to see some adjustment in terms of what financing offers are presented to the customer because they are trying to manage in a higher interest rate environment their costs i mentioned that particularly you get to some of the really shortdated stuff is that gets pretty expensive if youre to the consumer and the merchants paying for all of that so we have seen some partners working to rationalize the product offerings inside of their businesses john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very helpful and then second unrelated question is just thinking about the rsa next year brian maybe you can remind us is the correlation for the as credit normalizes is the correlation for the rsa to delinquencies provisions or chargeoffs and is there any seasonality or timing differences for us to think about there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah john well be back in january on as a whole but i think if you think about the rsa chargeoffs move immediately through the rsa line right so youre going to see that impact as that normalizes into that will provide a benefit to the rsa the other two components i think to think about is reserve postings growth or otherwise flow through the rsa a little bit of a lag so that will impact it but again brian consistently points out rightfully so that as credit normalizes we would expect to see your revenue increase and the yield increase on the portfolio so again if we dont see the payment rate change youre not going to have that normalization they have to work in concert so again i think those are the general synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 gives and takes i think the other thing will be how cost of funds really moves and that flows through as a benefit to the rsa in a rising rate environment john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you guys very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john operator our next question comes from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you growth has been extremely strong not only for you guys but also across the industry as payment rates have slowed and savings rates have come down given what you see out there from a macro perspective and these declining savings rate would you expect this growth to slow considerably as we move through the next few quarters and probably get down to a more normal rate maybe in the midsingle digits as we get through near the end of it just seems like these growth rates obviously arent able to be sustained for an extended period of time thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the way i think about it kevin is is you have this period of time where the consumer is working through number one excess liquidity that they have so that saves rate now well carry you through particularly on some of the higher spenders well into in some of the lower credit quality cohorts and indiscernible youre seeing wage gains that are offsetting inflation so you have some tailwinds with regard to spend and you see that strong spending behavior pattern what we probably anticipate is as some of that savings drives up as some of maybe the lack of or the utilization of lower discretionary spending because people arent going to the office every day as that tightens a little bit what youre going to see is probably spending come down and payment rate come down but i think what youre going to see first is payment rate begin to slow spending stay there youre going to see balances go up and then youre going to see purchase volumes slow so i think there could be elongation of asset growth here in the short term again well have to see how the economy and the macroeconomic scenario plays out for a medium term but clearly there are probably more tailwinds than headwinds in the short term kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then you addressed it earlier on some addressed underwriting standards and no changes there trying to maintain consistency you continue to target billion i believe buyback program what type of macro synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 conditions or underlying spending trends would you have to see play out before you would start to reconsider whether its underwriting standards or continuing to buy back stock at the level that youre buying it back brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial well ill start and ask brian to comment look i think we are running the business very nimbly right now were ingesting thousands of data points every day on what the consumer is doing payment trends and behaviors we look at it by program by product by geography were looking for any indicators that say we need to make some tweaks as we go and i call them tweaks because for us this is not an event its not one day youre risk on and the other day youre risk off its you kind of take what youre seeing every day and you kind of make changes and slight modifications as you go and we feel really good about our ability to do that weve invested a lot in our technology platform our data sources our tools and so there isnt one thing that we look at but as were looking at percent of customers that make the min payment how much above the min payment are they making whos gone late for the first time those are all little tells and little signs that say okay maybe we go in and we turn the dial a little bit and so again we feel really good about our ability to do that were not seeing anything right now that is concerning its been a very gradual id call it normalization as we move through the year in fact i think every quarter we updated our credit guidance and it was always modestly better than what we thought days prior so i think we are still in a pretty good operating environment we dont see anything that says we got to go in and really ratchet down ph credit and certainly nothing that says we got to do anything different than what were doing on the share repurchase side brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah brian covered incredibly let me just talk a little bit about capital i think when we look at our business model we have tremendous i think resiliency in the margin and our capital generation capacity so i think as we look out we look at whats our ability to generate capital we look at the growth in the rwas we look at preserving the dividend and then we run our stress test and again as we continue to run those quarterly we dont see anything even in some of the most severe scenarios that would have us alter or slow down the repurchase activities and capital plans we have in place but we do that every quarter well continue to do it and as long as we can continue to generate strong returns we feel good about our capital position and moving towards our target but ultimately were going to have to fully develop the capital stack to achieve the target and thats a little bit reliant upon the capital markets but we feel good there and again i think when you put the story together we really do feel good about the margin in the business when you think about the yield and the losses and then capital generation capacity kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks kevin operator our next question is from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning guys thanks for taking my question brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i just wanted to talk a little bit about the allowance coverage given where we are both in terms of growth you guys are indicating that credit will continue to normalize we saw an uptick in delinquencies economic outlook is changing why do we see the allowance coverage drift down a little bit and should we expect that to start heading higher as we move into brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks rick so when you look at how we have built our reserve models right so you look at our baseline macroeconomic forecast which again we take from moodys as a starting point and which shows call it an unemployment rate next year of when we think about credit normalization right and getting back to that as we look at the underwriting cohorts we put on over the last couple of years that migration back to the implied unemployment rate in the model is higher than that so to think about something thats probably closer to the mid effectively we dont necessarily put that in but effectively shows a higher unemployment rate we then on an overlay basis say okay if there is some concern what does that scenario look like so effectively it gives us a higher reserve coverage as we sit here today than what youd normally expect given the delinquency profile if you just looked at it by its own so unless there is a significant deterioration beyond that and we dont see that then youre really going to be in growth driven reserves if we just looked at delinquencies today and ran our quantitative models it would be below day one cecl right so we think were adequately reserved today to encompass what we think is going to happen in and moving out so we feel good about it i think when you look at the delinquencies that we have in here for it gives you a pretty good line of sight into what to expect both fourth quarter and most likely first quarter so you can plan that out and again absent something significantly change in the macro environment we feel pretty good about where the coverage is and that were adequately reserved for under various scenarios richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 yeah its interesting i think were all struggling with the same thing which is that we have a concern going forward but empirically when we look at the data today its hard to sort of connect the dots in terms of that deterioration so were running the same issues brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah but i think you have to look at it if i just ran the pure quantitative model id just go back to this point again youll be below day one cecl and its really the qualitative models and those overlays that is pushing you higher than day one and in theory allowing it so if you looked inside our quarter our quantitative models moved up and our qualitatives moved down as it kind of got embedded into the core delinquency formation so again i know we dont provide a lot of ability and people dont provide visibility into all those different models but they are working in concert with each other and thats where we get comfort that were appropriately provisioned at the end of the quarter richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great brian thank you very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks rick operator thank you we have time for one more question our final question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so two questions one i know we talked quite a bit about the net interest margin already its down a bit from the peaks that you had earlier this year and the exit run rate looks like its around synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 somewhere in that range for fourth quarter and im hearing you talk about the migration of the funding mix looking to go from savings to cds and i noticed your cd offer is pretty robust here months youve got at so are you suggesting that with the forward curve where the fed gets to or depending on which day you look at it that you lock that in on the yield side and as that comes through and your funding cost migrates higher but is capped relative to what the osa would do do you feel like the trajectory here should be nims continuing the path of decline as we move through the year next year or do you think that your shift to cds can halt that slide brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah again betsy well be back in january to give you a lot better guidance and visibility into nim the way i would think about it the pieces that you have moving inside of nim again from the yield side youre going to have the slowing payment rate give you better revolve in the short term higher late fees partially offset by some reversals youre going to see this continued effect of prime move in we bill almost on a 45day lag to when prime changes so youre going to see that effect of prime move through the portfolio we have the ability to adjust merchant pricing so those are the i call it tailwinds to nim again i do think locking in certificates of deposits at this rate if you do believe that the fed is going to continue to rise into while it may give you a little bit of pressure in the current quarter or two is going to be better as you move throughout the following year so its that shift again a lot of this is going to depend upon what money market funds do and what other institutions do we clearly see some customers migrating for yield but were going to remain competitive the positive news for us we also see money flowing out of big money center banks that arent paying a lot for deposits which gives us an attractive source and again so were optimistic that we can manage the funding profile and well be back in january to detail a little bit more betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just a followup question on your partner activity and how theyre looking to you to help them with their sales growth as you go into next year which is expected to be a little bit of a slower paced environment can you give us any sense as to any credit box changes that would come as a result of that or other ways that you can help drive your partners revenue growth thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure betsy look i think brian said it earlier we really dont try to rely on opening the credit box to drive sales that it typically doesnt end well so we try and stay very consistent disciplined there what we do work with our partners on is more around the value proposition and the experience for the customer as well as being able to offer multiple products and i think thats really where were focused were having really good discussions with our partners around how were going to support them for hopefully a strong holiday and that is offers val prop its experience its offering new products that are tailored for their customer i think its really that entire kind of ecosystem that we work on with our partners to drive sales for them its a proven model i think weve only enhanced it with the investments weve made over the last couple of years and were pretty optimistic that were going to support them in hopefully a strong holiday and into a hopefully strong synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director
