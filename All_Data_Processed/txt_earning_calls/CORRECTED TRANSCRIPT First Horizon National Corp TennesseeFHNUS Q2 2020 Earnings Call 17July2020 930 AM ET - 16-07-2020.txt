officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you ellen good morning everyone thank you for joining us in our call in this most unusual environment pandemicrelated economic slowdown weve had a very good quarter and im very proud of the work that our team has accomplished on july we closed our moe our merger of equals with iberiabank this merger creates a leading southern franchise with strong demographics and the ability to drive efficiency and create significant shareholder value given the disruption created by the covid19 pandemic our associates across the expanded platform have been working to tirelessly support clients and communities by originating ppp loans providing loan deferral assistance waiving fees all while effectively managing risk at the same time they have continued to ensure that execution on the iberia integration as well as the branch acquisition remain on track our expanded franchise strengthens our geographic reach and depth provides improved ability to better serve our customers and community provides enhanced growth opportunities and gives a scale to compete more efficiently this quarter we delivered solid results with strong ppnr growth driven by strong fee income performance and good expense discipline as our countercyclical businesses help mitigate environmental headwinds our fixedincome business delivered strong results and nii remained relatively stable as we grew average loans led by loans to mortgage companies and the ppp portfolio first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 during the quarter we built our loan loss reserve by million raising our allowance to loans coverage ratio to or excluding lower risk loans to mortgage companies and the ppp portfolio we are continuing heightened monitoring and review of the loan portfolios in order to evaluate the impact of covid19 on our customer base and ensure that we are prudently managing risk while helping support customers and the economy overall bj will give you details about economic assumptions supporting our reserve level but i believe were taking appropriately cautious view in the quarter we further bolstered our capital with debt and preferred share issuances as expected our cet1 ratio increased over basis points linkedquarter to which positions us well as we look toward the second half of while we acknowledge that the microeconomic backdrop and industry landscape remain very challenging we believe our combined company remains wellpositioned to drive enhanced shareholder value over the medium term with that ill turn it over to bj to take you through the details bj william c losch iii senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee great thanks bryan good morning everybody happy friday as im sure you know but as a reminder our moe with iberia closed on july therefore the results ill be discussing are for first horizon standalone later ill give you some highlights of iberias standalone results for the quarter as well as some key legal day one impacts from the merger closing that you should expect to see in our results with that lets start with some highlights of our second quarter adjusted results as bryan mentioned we delivered strong ppnr growth which was up linkedquarter and yearoveryear despite the challenging interest rate environment macroeconomic backdrop revenue was up in the quarter and a yearoveryear driven by strong fee income growth with stable net interest income results we think this quarter in particular really highlights the benefits of our countercyclical fixed income and mortgage warehouse lending platforms that are helping mitigate some of the headwinds that we are seeing across the banking industry we generated nice balance sheet growth and continue to manage our deposit costs down and given the environment we continue to be highly focused on expense discipline our core cecl is the factor driving provision costs higher for the banks overall and as we updated our models for the further downdraft in the economic outlook compared to march we built our loan loss reserves by an additional million or a share moving to slide you can see that solid loan growth and disciplined deposit pricing helped us generate modest nii growth in the quarter despite a 26basispoint decline in the margin as a reminder our asset sensitivity is most highly correlated to one month libor which was down basis points on average during the quarter pretty significant pressure on loan yields in addition because of strong customer liquidity the nim was pressured further by excess cash balances which created an additional 9basispoint drag on the margin at the same time we continued to lower our deposit cost overall which were down basis points in the quarter and the margin benefited from the addition of over billion of ppp loans and the associated fees which helped to offset some pressure from lower accretion first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 as we look forward while it will be challenging to offset the additional headwinds from the rate environment we will continue to look for opportunities to bring deposit pricing down further and more efficiently manage the balance sheet while still maintaining a prudent stance on liquidity given the uncertainty in the overall landscape looking forward we could see the nim compress further possibly in the midteens range primarily due to the addition of the truist branches those branches will provide about billion of additional excess funding which will further improve our liquidity profile loan and deposit ratio and profitability over time but will temporarily depress the margin while we find ways to put the excess funding to work over the next few months briefly on slide fee income was up linked quarter and yearoveryear the fee income growth was driven by strength in fixed income and deferred compensation ph partially offset by lower deposit card and other bank fees given impacts from covid while our more traditional banking fee income lines were challenged in the quarter as others have seen across the industry given that some of our markets have begun reopening we did start to see some improvement at the end of the quarter in debit card and atm volumes as well as a pickup in wealth fixed income revenue in particular was up linkedquarter and yearoveryear as we saw strong sales activities and a turnaround in trading results following the challenging conditions that occurred in march as a result the team delivered average daily revenue of million during the quarter compared with million in the first given the overall landscape we believe the fixed income business remains very wellpositioned to capitalize on its extensive distribution platform and experienced sales force to drive continued solid results on slide quickly cover expense trends as we may remain committed to a highly disciplined approach to managing the cost base given the swing in market valuations we saw an increase in employee compensation cost driven by a million increase in deferred comp related to market changes which is offset by increases in other income outside of this our results benefited from lower stockbased compensation fas deferrals and lower operating costs overall largely tied to impact of the shutdown importantly though we were able to take an additional million of costs out in connection with our iberia merger during the quarter as was iberia so overall we have achieved a total of million in merger savings between the two companies over the first half of this year meeting our expectations we set back in november when we announced the transaction we continue to be very confident in our ability to generate the merger cost savings of million over the next months on slides and we provide a view of our loan growth and funding profile as i mentioned we generated healthy average loan growth of linkedquarter and yearoveryear driven by loans to mortgage companies which were up on average billion linkedquarter reflecting strong refi volume due to low rates we also picked up billion in ppp loans as well and the balance of the ci portfolio saw declines tied to lower line utilizations from the peak that occurred in early april as commercial customers position started to improve in the wake of government programs and reopenings resulting in a reduction in the defensive draws that we saw in the end of the first quarter as bryan mentioned customer sentiment remains cautious and we do expect only modest loan growth at best for the second half of at the same time weve continued to work to further enhance our funding mix and capital stack deposits were up linkedquarter driven by strength in dda and savings in the regional bank we saw first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 customer deposit rates pay decreased to basis points from basis points overall we lowered our interest bearing deposit cost basis points in the quarter to basis points and while the mix of our deposit base will be a little different going forward than in the last rate cycle with the addition of iberia and the truist branches we do think its helpful to note that in the third quarter of our interestbearing deposit costs ended at basis points we also felt that in the face of continued economic uncertainty it was important to continue to augment our capital and liquidity stacks since april weve issued billion of senior subdebt and preferred securities we issued million of holdco senior debt prefunding of million maturity coming due in december million of banks subdebt and million of holding company preferred on slide youll see that as expected we had a nice bounce back in our capital position from unusually low first quarter levels that were driven by outsized periodend loan growth primarily from loans to mortgage companies the cet1 ratio was up over basis points to end the quarter at while total capital increased basis points to our strong ppnr subdebt and preferred issuances and a reduction in riskweighted assets drove our capital levels higher and gave us ample cushion as we prepare for the future while there will be many moving parts next quarter obviously as we close both the iberia transaction and the truist branch acquisition sitting here today we would expect our cet1 ratio to be in the low in the third quarter additionally on slide you can see we ended the quarter with really healthy levels of reserves allowance for loan losses totaled million or over eight times annualized net charge offs we built a reserve by million entirely attributable to anticipated further deterioration in overall macro trends we think its important to note that while our models most heavily weighted the moodys may 27th baseline scenario we supplemented this with alternative scenarios and did very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected by the pandemic we also incorporated additional factors such as the reemergence of covid cases additional geographic data in fact its stimulus programs and overall economic uncertainty for your reference we have a detailed table in the appendix that shows reserve coverage by portfolio our coverage again excluding ppp and loans to mortgage companies which have exceptionally low to no loss content and stands at around on a standalone basis moving to slide you can see that overall the asset quality picture still remains relatively benign while we continue to monitor our loan portfolios carefully the net chargeoff to average loans ratio came in at basis points with the losses this quarter driven primarily by two credits one loan in energy and the other in the franchise finance portfolio weve given some details on deferrals at the bottom of the page and as you can see total deferrals of both commercial and consumer portfolios were at billion representing low percentages of customer accounts overall interestingly more than of customers that asked and received deferrals have made at least one payment since being on deferral status we will continue to work proactively with these and all of our customers and monitor the portfolios carefully lets shift now to slide and look at iberia results and expected impacts from the closing of our moe first we provide iberiabanks standalone second quarter financial highlights on slide we plan to file pro forma financials for the combined company later in the quarter but thought it was important to provide some information to continue to illustrate the power of the new expanded and more diversified franchise iberiabank also delivered solid ppnr which was up linkedquarter first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 net interest income was relatively stable as loan growth of linkedquarter was more than matched by deposit growth helping to mitigate some of the interest rate headwinds iberia generated record fee income up over in the first quarter and over yearoveryear fueled by strong momentum in mortgage origination income with a healthy mortgage pipeline at the end of the quarter of course provision expense in the quarter was up significantly as well given the impact of the updated outlook in the macro environment but now lets move on to cover our expectations for the impact with our merger accounting on slide and as of july we updated our estimates for the marks on a portfolio based on the current landscape and a detailed review of those portfolios you can see on slide that we expect to record a total of million or of loans including total marks of million for credit and interest rateliquidity and million of nonpcd double count this million of total initial marks will show up as follows approximately million of it will go into the allowance for loan losses approximately million million related to the nonpcd discount and the million of interest in liquidity mark will be an initial reduction of capital but will accrete back through net interest income over time and at the bottom of the slide we had laid out for you our current estimate of the timing of that accretion coming back into income and capital in the table at the top of the page you can see that we now currently estimate total credit of the total credit marks that are a little over half or about billion of the portfolio will be considered purchase credit deteriorated pcd with the remainder of the portfolio designated as nonpcd its important to note that the pcd designation as defined by cecl does not mean that the loans are bad and its not intended to be an indication of perceived loss content associated with the portfolio so the initial marks will reduce our cet capital by about basis points at close on page you can see the current estimate of the merger accounting adjustments which will result in a roughly million nontaxable gain that will be recognized through the income statement in our third quarter results with a roughly billion addition to tangible common equity on page we provide a reminder of the million in expense savings that we are targeting for the combined company in connection with the merger and as i mentioned earlier we have achieved around million so far in the first half of the year with million in this quarter alone we expect to have an exit run rate at the end of of of our targeted cost saves and we are well on our way to achieving that our integration efforts are on track and we are confident in our ability to deliver on the savings and the benefits of the merger with the strong belief that we will be able to exceed our targets so with that bryan ill hand it back over to you d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks bj with our strong balance sheet business mix including our countercyclical businesses our strong capital base and liquidity they will all serve us well in this difficult environment we have maintained underwriting standards that are very strong and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability despite the economic headwinds were uniquely positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale better efficiency and improved earnings power to create shareholder value first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 we will continue to assist our associates communities and clients efforts to overcome covid19s impact and revitalize the economy thank you to all of our associates for your outstanding commitment and efforts in dealing with these unprecedented times with that andrea we will now take questions question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question will come from brady gailey of kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc if we look at loan growth excluding the mortgage warehouse and excluding ppp i think period end balances were down a little linkedquarter maybe just comment on i saw utilization went down probably maybe just comment on if s loan growth kind of exwarehouse and exppp and then bj i heard you say you expect modest loan growth at best for the back half year but maybe just a little more color on how youre thinking about loan growth going forward d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey brady this is bryan ill start and then susan or bj can pick up the loan growth on an absolute basis outside of ppp and mortgage warehouse was down a little bit most of that was driven by what you saw in the significant line draws that occurred late in the first quarter in the march timeframe when the economy started shutting down more broadly those lines paid down if you look at the loan growth through the second quarter you could characterize it as bj did earlier is reasonably modest most of the new loans were to existing customers and tended to be at levels that would be very low relative to say the last months or two years but our expectation is that we will have some activity that the line draws have sort of worked their way through the system that well continue to support customers both existing and opportunities to take on customers in the first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 marketplace but we dont expect to have tremendous amount of loan growth throughout the rest of this year at least until we get to the other side of this pandemic susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee the only thing i would really add brady is we remain very focused as we always have on full relationships and so we continue to work with our client in some prospects that we brought into the ppp program but we remain as you can imagine very prudent in our underwriting and have a higher level of review for new extensions of credit but we do believe that there could be some limited opportunities that as bryan said would expect loan growth would remain in the lower range certainly compared to the last months to months william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i would just add one more thing i mean brady were definitely open for business its not that question its just lower activity from clients looking to extend credit because of like bryan talked about the pandemic theres just obvious caution across portfolios but well continue to look for good opportunities to continue to grow customer relationships brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then next on your common dividend i think there has been some investor focus on your dividend post when we saw the ccar results but you didnt earn the dividend last quarter you earned it this quarter but the payout ratio is pretty high if you included the million gain next quarter you will earn it by multiples but how are you thinking about the stability of your dividend going forward d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey brady this is bryan again the board considered the dividend every quarter and then we looked at the rules that have at least been publicly made available from the fed and our modeling and our outlook indicates to us that we will be in a position to continue to recommend our dividend to the board of directors i would say that as a backdrop while we are confident in it we dont know what we dont know about this economy and its important that the board not only looks at dividend but looks at capital and capital adequacy longterm so that could change but based on our modeling based on our outlook based on our understanding of the rules and the fed framework we feel very confident that we will be recommending to our board that they consider continuing the dividend at the current levels brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally a quick one bj it was helpful to have the forecast for the yield accretion for the next few years that is just probably the scheduled yield accretion right that doesnt include any unscheduled so reality is what some payoffs youll probably see numbers a little higher than that is that the right way to think about that william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah thats correct yeah its going to be based on this is based on our assumed timing and youre right if theres an acceleration then there could be a change much like weve seen in other transaction brady first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you guys william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee sure operator our next question comes from john pancari of evercore please go ahead rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc hi this is rahul patil on behalf of john i just had a question around the the loan mark so i know in midapril you had provided an update around the loan mark and i believe the total mark around that time was around million to million and then one could argue that the macro has kind of worsened since midapril through the deal closed in july how come that didnt influence the credit market im looking at the total loan marks at million right now how come that didnt influence the credit mark and then also it looks like the rate mark of bps is sort of consistent with the level that you had announced back in november and obviously rates have come down quite a lot since then and im just wondering like how did that not influence your rate mark because it looks like that also stayed at bps so just a couple of clarification questions around that william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee sure so its bj so yeah its been a wild ride on trying to estimate marks between november of last year and today and so like you said we gave interim updates during the course of that so if you recall back in november we would have had credit marks assumed that announcement of and interest rate mark of about basis points so that would have been the interim that youre referring to would have captured a little bit more of a credit mark but a substantially higher interest rateliquidity mark and i would put more emphasis on the liquidity mark so when we put out that that disclosure back a couple of months ago it was at the height of the liquidity crisis and the fear in the markets before the fed programs had fully been rolled out so the assumption was much higher on the liquidity and interest rate mark subsequently markets have gotten a lot more liquid that liquidity and interest rate mark has come back down but our expectations around the future outlook on credit have deteriorated so all in all our credit mark is higher by probably than what we would have thought back in november interest rateliquidity marks interestingly enough kind of landed in the same place but as you can see in the table the mix of the pcd and nonpcd has changed materially as well so lots of moving parts in here but the bottom line is we feel very comfortable that our teams have done great extensive work on the valuation that were building very healthy reserves that go into the allowance and weve got additional loss absorption capacity that will accrete back through income over time to the tune of about million so were very comfortable with the estimates that weve got rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 okay and then just a question on first horizons standalone expense base so i believe it was like six months ago your expectations for first horizons expense base was around million million per quarter and im looking at numbers on a core basis it came in around at million so that million differential obviously partly is driven by this stronger fixed income business performance but how much of that differential in your expense base do you expect to normalize in coming quarters or should we kind of expect like that million is like the normal sort of run rate for first horizon assuming fixed income kind of stays strong william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so how i describe it is that the increase that youre talking about is all related to two things one is as you mentioned fixed income variable compensation which comes with additional revenue that we gained so theres net positive benefit to our pretax income from that additional expense and this quarter we had deferred compensation expenses that were quite mature early in the quarter as well we dont expect those to continue thats that will certainly moderate so we still believe that wed like to see fixed income remain strong which we think it will so i would if i were you take out the deferred compensation impact in this quarter and then once we start to look at our companies on a combined basis start to layer in the mergerrelated cost saves and we expect to see meaningful declines over time in our expense base d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee bj one more that i would add to that list is the provision for unfunding credit which was million this quarter million last quarter visàvis a year ago it was essentially zero william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you yeah d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee but those two are fairly significant and theyre pandemic related in the sense that theyre related to potential credit losses for unfunded commitments that just happens to flow through our expense base william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah thats a great point i just want to bottom line or reiterate we have done an excellent job of managing our expenses and so the increases here are all related to either support of additional revenue on pretax income or the two things that bryan and i discussed and we are continuing to focus very very strongly on expense discipline operator our next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning jared susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just looking at the margin i guess the start and the growth in cash and with the expectation for additional cash growth from the branch shield and the ibkc deal how should we be thinking about sort of the deployment of that cash into either securities or i guess securities or your expectation for customers deposit use so as we go forward through the next few quarters how should we be looking at that sort of net cash position william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so as ive said in my earlier comments we think that initially in the third quarter the addition of the net billion of funding from truist is going to depress the margin maybe in the midteens range and over the next few to several months were going to figure out ways to deploy that in terms of either securities loan growth managing down other higher cost deposits et cetera so we expect that to be a temporarytype depression of the margin and so set a different way if the truist acquisition was not being completed in the quarter we would think the margin would be relatively stable to just down modestly as opposed to down in the midteens because of the addition of the excess cash jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then can you talk a little bit about the deferral extension process as that initial 90day period ends how are you approaching extension there and do you expect to be able to get either additional credit enhancements or any type of beneficial term restructuring as those go forward susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi jared related to the deferrals we are really getting to the end of the first round of 90day deferrals requested by our customers and we are really on a casebycase basis with our commercial customers asking questions about other sources of cash and sponsor guarantor support et cetera and oftentimes we are getting some additional whether its a guarantee asking a guarantor owner to put in more equity potentially looking at other structural elements at this point and weve had a deep portfolio review as bj mentioned in his remarks on our slides with a number of related to specific loans in a number of portfolios in fact we covered over of some of the higher risk first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 portfolios and we were talking with our bankers about what their clients were telling them we dont at this point were not anticipating nearly the number of second round deferrals as we had in the first round really only in two real industry pockets do we expect potentially second round deferrals to be maybe near what they were in first round and that would be some of the restaurant franchise finance company and some of our hotel borrowers otherwise based on feedback weve received over the last really days to days were not hearing of a big increase obviously were watching that closely as things continue to be very dynamic around the covid situation related to various states but many of our customers are reporting good liquidity good cash reserves a combination of their operating at lower expenses the benefits of the government programs including the ppp program the eidl program the cares ph grant programs so again we were glad were glad to be able to assist customers during this time but right now the second round of deferrals appears to be a much lighter request than we had on the first round jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great color thanks and then just finally for me on as we look at going forward if we do see additional macro deterioration based on the moodys models should we assume that youre all are more willing to use qualitative overlays with the additional credit protection from the moe or should we expect to see that the macro impact from any future deterioration would be a similar impact susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee so actually for the second quarter and we did in the first quarter but even more in the second quarter in addition to the moodys baseline we actually did apply a good bit of qualitative overlay on a number of portfolios that either or have the potential to have some effect from covid so as an example of some of the portfolios that where we had an additional qualitative overlay included not for profits senior living like nursing homes assisted living health care and then even a more significant qualitative on some other areas which you would expect things like restaurants entertainment hospitality retail and then in an energy we took a very very strong look and did a a great deal of the clients there as we went through borrowingbased redeterminations looked at hedge strategies et cetera and so we did deploy a good qualitative overlay in the second quarter and will continue to do that as we evaluate cecl at this point we feel like were well reserved for the portfolios that we have and well continue obviously to evaluate that next quarter i guess for this quarter third quarter as we get near the end of the quarter but we feel like weve got a good robust process and have taken both as i said the moodys process but then the subject matter expertise and that qualitative overlay based on information we gained from the deep dives that weve had william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee and i would add to what susan said that as we evaluated the loan marks on the iberia portfolio we did the same thing we used qualitative overlays where we needed to particularly around stress sectors as susan outlined so we feel like we had fulsome marks and we have very healthy reserves on the first horizon standalone side first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee this is bryan its an interesting time to be estimating loan loss reserves and were all trying to figure out how cecl works in the real world and in many ways it is ill stick with illtimed and overly burdensome but if you sort of step back from the loan portfolios and you look at the various components youre seeing some places where there are trouble emerging and susan did a good job in enumerating those places but theres a disconnect between call it million in net chargeoffs and million in round numbers of loan loss reserves and we fully expect what borrowers are doing today that there are a lot of places that this economy can go and what happens if we have more shutdown or reshutdown what happens if the congress and the administration dont put together a fully helpful another round of stimulus what happens if their liquidity programs change right now the economy is doing better than you might think and borrowers are doing better than you might think given the economic environment were in we attribute a lot of that to the great work that the treasury and the fed have done with programs like main street lending which has not really been used but it implies liquidity programs ppp the stimulus payments consumers are still relatively strong credit card volume has been picking up since the economy started reopening so allinall weve got a sober and cautious outlook on what happens over the remainder of the year but when you talk to individual borrowers and you go through individual elements of the portfolio things are doing much better than you might expect at this point in time and you take the restaurant business if youre in the quick serve restaurant business youre back to where you were prepandemic largely speaking and in some cases your comps are up depending on the business youre in so it is a tale of many stories out there right now and its just an odd time to be trying to flyspeck what loan loss reserves and life of loan losses might look like jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks for the color d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah you are welcome operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi steve d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi steve first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc bryan does it stay with the reserve conversation this being an odd time based on everything youre looking at now do you think the majority of the reserve building under cecl is now behind you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee well clearly from an accounting perspective we take the information we have and we book what we think are life of loan losses and so if the economy plays out consistent with that set of assumptions yes i think so but as i said earlier in talking about the dividend we dont know what we dont know about how this virus plays out its a medicallydriven crisis and until we get a solution to that its hard to know how it plays through the economy but i think we have based on all the information we have available to us book sufficient reserves to cover losses in the portfolio as it stands today steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and as we get to the second half and some of these deferrals start transitioning into defaults is it likely youll then need to establish a specific reserve or is the plan to start using these qualitative overlays that youre building into the reserve today d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee well i think clearly that we built some of these reserves and the qualitative reserves in anticipation of specific problem so our intent would be to use those as they evolve yes steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and then shifting direction to fixed income it was nice to see adr above the prior range its been a while im curious how did adr trend through the quarter and do you think its sustainable at these levels thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah adr trended positively throughout the quarter we finished the quarter very strong and i would say a very good start to the third quarter as well we do think it is sustainable and some of it is sort of the extension of the comments we made about loan growth to the extent macro loan growth is not good across the industry there are more opportunities for securities and securities portfolios and financial institutions and the question came up about cash on balance sheet thats happening across the industry so thats good for the business the average daily revenue this quarter was impacted a little bit by the reversal of what we call negative splits in the end of the first quarter being reversed another name would be portfolio gains or trading gains and losses that occurred but average daily revenue has looked good the trends look good and our outlook for the remainder of first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 the year is that our fixed income business will continue to serve as a or the countercyclical buffer that weve always believed it to be steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee yes youre welcome thank you operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning its nice to see some of the clouds begin to part here following on steves question i do worry about fhn securities because the performance has been so good its repeatedly beaten our expectations and wanted to just go back to your comments bryan and i mean is this more of a kind of flat from here sort of set up into the back half which should still be very very strong or do you think you could actually climb it out from here d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee i think my outlook would be that you sort of if you were going to forecast it out you wouldnt show a lot of growth and you wouldnt show a decline in a whole lot itd be sort of in the area of sort of the average of where its been in the last couple of quarters brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and bj one of the areas where the clouds kind of remain is around the net interest margin i know youve taken a crack at defining that a bit youve got ppp youve got the branch sale or the branch purchase coming in as you look and as we can see of course it may be as you look at year end q4 what kind of a core nim should we be looking at william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so yeah by the way i dont know why bryan gets the good question on strong fixed income and i get the tough question on nim so i would expect that the core nim continues to be pressured through the back half of the year i mean that weve got hopefully loan yields stabilizing a bit we still have some room as i talked about earlier on deposits and deposit rates paid we still think that we can bring those down but the reality is were going to continue to have a high class problem of excess liquidity that were going to have to work through so thats going to be the depression in the margin i wouldnt translate that into material declines in overall nii because weve got accretion coming through even if the margin is it is compressed by excess liquidity it goes into excess balances at the fed and thats largely a wash so its again continue its going to be challenged but weve got opportunities to mitigate it both in the net interest income line as well as what bryan just talked about first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 the countercyclical businesses that weve got a fixed income loans to mortgage companies and as a combined company the mortgage origination platform that iberia has which had a record quarter in the first quarter and then soundly beat that record quarter in the second quarter so we have multiple levers that we think can offset some of these headwinds and we work hard to mitigate as much as we can brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for the color william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks brock operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america securities please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi guys william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just wanted to follow up on the nim bj you earlier mentioned that extruist we expect the nim would be relatively stable to going down modestly so just wanted to put some numbers around to make sure we get this correct indiscernible you expect the late teens declines so lets call it about is that a decent place when we reflect truist reflect iberia we reflect ppp for now in terms of where the core nim should be around the and then maybe it might have some upside as we deploy that liquidity as ppp runs off or is there a more downside to that core nim relative to a number william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so i had said midteens and our core nim is in the quarter and when i have been speaking about what i thought second half of the year looked like im obviously contemplating not just standalone im first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 contemplating the iberia merger the truist acquisition and you know the puts and takes of those so yeah i think its midteens primarily from the liquidity the excess liquidity that we will see from truist ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sorry indiscernible and then whats your view on ppp running off do you expect most of this to be forgiven by the end of the year william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yes we do ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes got it and would you have like what the pro forma earning assets or what the quarterend earning asset growth for both the balance sheets just trying to get a sense of what we should expect in terms of the size of the balance sheet looking out into with all these things added d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee the pro forma earnings assets at june 30th ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee so pro forma loans for both first horizon and iberia together if you look at ph without ppp is about billion and i know you ask for all earning assets but i thought id go and give you the loans obviously thats without ppp we had a combined ppp portfolio of about little over about billion so if you include ppp total loans on a pro forma basis at the end of june are about billion william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah ive got ebrahim ive got earning asset at roughly billion ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks i got it thats helpful and just one separate question so i guess for susan so youve talked a lot about credit and what weve done in the uncertainty on the macro at this point like when you look at the loan portfolio are you still making decisions based on portfolio level details as you mentioned in restaurant finance hotel or would you say you have a good handle on granularly looking at these loans customer by customer i think bryan alluded to it just trying to get a sense of is this still a modelbased exercise or do you have a good sense around and comfort around customers ability to withstand if things dont get materially worse which would imply a decent dropoff in terms of credit provisioning relative to what weve seen in the first half first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee right so we in addition to portfolio levels that were looking at and were looking at information loanbyloan our bankers are updating loan by loan information based on customer feedback were also looking at a lot of market information around whats going on with various franchises in the franchise finance space whats going on with hotel occupancies and adrs but then again looking at that on a customerbycustomer basis so we will continue to do that just as a reminder we talked about this last quarter but we feel very good about the disciplined underwriting that weve had since the last financial crisis and i would say this applies to both legacy first horizon and legacy iberia as it relates two things like in the commercial real estate book hospitality of average equities in the range and so it gives us a lot of cushion our customers a lot of cushion when you have something unprecedented like a covid pandemic maybe a data point that some customers saw this was when things were starting to open back up bryan alluded to this on the restaurant side we clearly sat on the restaurant side but also in the hotel portfolio because our hotel portfolios tend to be smaller driving distance type hotels that cater to family travel some business travel we have very limited exposure to convention large hotel business and we heard from clients that memorial day end of june through july some of them had were fully occupied we also saw as bryan said average restaurant checks went up as more people did take out they were buying more than they would if they went in and they were thinking about i might want some later so we are seeing that both in that market data that we get on all of our industries and study but also talking with individual customers about what theyre seeing so we will continue to look at both but again i was also pleased with the resiliency that i saw out of our clients when you have the complete shutdown and then things open back up we saw dramatic increases pretty quickly but as bryan and bj said were also watching theres some additional shutdowns that have occurred but again resilient customers prudent underwriting and so we believe weve got a reserve for what our lifetime losses will be based on what we know today d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee id add to the resiliency customers had been very creative in the way theyve adapted to an unusual set of circumstances and you see our customers adapting their business model to meet changing circumstances and it really is amazing and if nothing else it is a testament an overall testament to the strength and creativity of the economy in the us operator our next question comes from garrett holland of baird please go ahead garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc good morning thanks for taking the question i just have a nearterm one on expenses whats a good range for core expenses as we think about the q3 or the back half of the year william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee standalone or combined or first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc the combined indiscernible william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think ill defer and have our ir folks follow up with you on that because theres so many moving parts to what weve got in terms of mergerrelated one times and those types of things that i think it would be better to give you that in a different format garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc understand i guess just bigger picture i know the deal just closed but you sound very positive on its potential and clearly the environment has changed though since youve announced the transaction how would you recast earnings power or advise thinking about the return potential for the combined company in this type of environment william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee well i think the way i would characterize it is shortterm i think we and everybody else are focused on safety and soundness right healthy reserves strong capital levels strong liquidity and funding profiles beyond that its controlling what we can control and what we can control is particularly in this environment our support of our countercyclical businesses our deposit pricing discipline and a huge level of course for us is taking cost out of our combined organization in a very material way over the next several quarters so i think those things will position us very well in terms of our ability to maintain profitability over the next several quarters beyond that we are very convicted and optimistic about the opportunity we have long term as a combined organization weve got the cost saves that will come in we are in very attractive markets we are continuing to build a diversified business mix with countercyclical businesses our enhanced scale will help so over the medium and long term we still feel like we can generate top tier profitability over the long term and were building a company to position us well to do that garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks bj d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey garrett this is bryan look i think this is its hard to sort of model what was in the numbers in november and whats in the numbers today because cecl changes everything but as we talked about today both businesses are seeing strong ppnr were seeing very good activity in our franchise we think that there is a great deal of leverage in fact were seeing in the first couple weeks of merger postmerger timeframe referrals of business that go into our assetbased lending business so we havent modeled in any of the synergies but those synergies will be there on the revenue side the one thing im certain of is we have the ability to hit our commitments of first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 million plus i think we have the opportunity to upsize that over time and i cant understate how important a lever that is in an environment like this these are costs that we couldnt get at on an individual basis by combining the two organizations in a no premium merger of equals we have the ability to create million pretax plus of run rate savings on an annual basis that you can annuitize and so thats a big deal and that will be a big driver over the next months so as bj said longer term i think were going to be in a position with the markets that were in with the bankers that we have on the playing field the team thats out there covering our customer base and our strength of balance sheet were going to have superior growth opportunities and in the short run were going to have levers to pull with our countercyclical businesses and our cost savings that are going to be meaningful in terms of creating shareholder value operator our next question comes from jennifer demba of suntrust please go ahead d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi jennifer susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning could you just talk about your criticized loan trend from sequentially and where youre seeing the most increase and then can you also talk about what youre expecting in terms of the nearterm net chargeoff levels over the next six months i know that they stayed quite low in the second quarter thank you susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee jennifer as it relates to criticized loans im going to talk about first horizon standalone and ive got some information on the combined basis as well if you look at technical difficulty ellen a taylor a headinvestor relations first horizon national corp tennessee operator could you mute that please operator apologies jennifer seems to have placed us on hold would you like to move to the next questioner ellen a taylor a headinvestor relations first horizon national corp tennessee why dont we go ahead susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 im going to answer the question yeah so jennifer asked about criticized loan changes and so for first horizon standalone we saw about million added to criticized loans quarteroverquarter iberia added just under million so we have about million added quarteroverquarter in the criticized loans of which about million was energy related across the two portfolios i would say that both companies took a very conservative approach as we look through our energy portfolios and took the appropriate action we needed to upgrading those so on a percentage basis of criticized loans first horizons standalone went from about of the portfolio to by the way these numbers exclude ppp loans on the percentage of loans and then on a combined basis again pro forma end of the quarter criticized loans were about of the portfolio up from about if you look at it at the end of the first quarter so we did see some increase in criticized loans well i dont have a specific forecast for net chargeoffs we are obviously looking at some increase in the criticized loans based on what we know today in the economy i would expect that we would have the net chargeoffs in the third and fourth quarter at this point though i dont really have a forecast but theres a good bit of uncertainty but as we mentioned earlier because of how cecl works we believe that weve got were well reserved for lifetime losses in the portfolio based on what we know today and to complete really the deep dives that we get on the portfolio and specifically the higher risk portfolio william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah and i would say just to add susan talked about it the majority of the increase being energy and energy being one of the nearterm portfolios that we would obviously be most focused on our coverage of the combined energy portfolio will be around so we significantly increased the reserves on those portfolios through both the marks and on the standalone side so you know thats one of the places that we have leaned in along with the other sectors that susan talked about earlier operator our next question will come from casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc so you guys gave us an update on the fixed income business but the mortgage warehouse unless i missed it whats the outlook there it seems like it could have lags given where mortgage rates are going and any color on the split between refi and purchase as well as where yields are today first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee so mortgage warehouse refi purchase is up refi in the second quarter which is kind of what you would expect with rates would you think those as their low points go down again so theres been some good activity there yields in the second quarter were about ph for that mortgage warehouse portfolio so as we have over the last three years added customers through the customer account in mortgage warehouse but ill let bj talk maybe about the outlook for this warehouse william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yes casey i think as you remember in the first quarter we had a very significant run up in the last five weeks of the quarter and periodend balances top ticked at around billion they stayed pretty elevated because of strong activity through the quarter and you saw our average balance is actually up pretty materially and loans to mortgage companies first to second the period end balances were down more in the billion range right so the business does ebb and flow based on the flow of mortgage originations and the mix of purchase and refi going into the third quarter we see continued strength in the business and so we expect it to grow from the periodend balances of billion and likely be in the range of the average balances that we saw in the second quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you bryan just big picture question for you when you guys announced this deal in early november obviously it was a much much different world things seem to be tracking at least from a capital perspective and cost save perspective plans but is there anything strategically either on the first horizon or the iberia side of the house a loan vertical or indiscernible portfolio strategy change that you guys are thinking about just given how different the world is today versus november d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee well there are not any significant changes no were still equally convicted about merits of the transaction and i am extraordinarily pleased with the way the team has come together it has been remarkable and while we had the first four months to bring people together in a facetoface environment since march weve been doing it via webex and zoom and all the other electronic virtual means that you can come up with but the team has come together and doing very very well and as i mentioned were seeing some opportunities to leverage portfolios or businesses across both organizations i mentioned abl bj mentioned the mortgage business and the title business that iberiabank brings to the table so we still see a lot of that well fine tune some things one is that if you look closely at the numbers youll see for example the commitments in energy were down a little bit this quarter it represents on a combined basis about of the portfolio so were willing to trim our sales as the economy continues to adjust to the pandemic and then the post pandemic world but on a macro basis were still equally convicted about the opportunities of bringing these two organizations together and im glad were beyond the starting line and the hard work is in place so its an exciting time to get that done and i think as i said earlier were going to see a lot of shareholder value created when we combine these two companies over the next months first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee youre welcome thank you operator our next question will come from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc indiscernible good morning how are you just wanted to focus on the branch acquisition and sort of strategically bryan does that do you look at it any differently than you did last fall just given where we are and also the high liquidity that bj had addressed earlier d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee well i think you raised an accounting and an economic point that excess deposits today are sort of different in a zero rate environment but from a strategic standpoint i think it is a home run transaction for us and were very very pleased with that transaction as bj mentioned earlier that conversion and acquisition is going on this weekend so those customers and those branches will be converted over the weekend and what it will do is overnight well do years of branch building in the carolinas in terms of average branches with call it million in deposits and give us meaningful share in the middle part in north carolina and back to what we said in when we merged with capital bank it was we wanted to have a meaningful presence in the carolinas and to pick up a top five presence in the triangle in the triad area greensboro winstonsalem high point and to pick up meaningful share in durham and chapel hill the triangle area in north carolina is significant and from a strategic standpoint if we started building these branches we couldnt create branches of this quality in years this is just a quality franchise and we were lucky to partner with suntrust bbt and now truist that acquire these branches so were proud of what were building in virginia carolinas and georgia with this transaction christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thanks thanks for that and i guess when you have the systems fully converted you can do more with those branches too right so we can stop thinking about it in that context d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee oh yeah absolutely but the systems will be converted sunday morning so everything will be done this weekend so its soup to nuts this weekend on a branch acquisition so well hit the ground running and people have worked really really hard over the last few months and its one of the reasons we deferred we wanted to be in a position to do adequate customer communication adequate training weve got ambassadors in all of these banking centers from the first horizon perspective who will be helping with systems and technology and first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 things like that over the next couple of weeks but were going to hit the ground running in these branches financial centers banking centers who will be part of the first horizon franchise this weekend and well hit the ground running monday morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee it really does help i mean obviously having additional banking centers improves our ability not only to reach additional consumers but small businesses in middle market companies still like to see a branch presence and so it enhances the work that our bankers have already done and calling on and bringing in business from all the areas where well have expanded presence and in a few situations presence that we didnt have before so we look forward to that in addition to serving consumers but also the business side christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you for the additional feedback i appreciate it from both of you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee all right thanks chris have a good weekend operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to bryan jordan for any closing remarks d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon national corp tennessee thank you andrea i appreciate all the hard work that our associates are doing and as i mentioned the branch conversion
