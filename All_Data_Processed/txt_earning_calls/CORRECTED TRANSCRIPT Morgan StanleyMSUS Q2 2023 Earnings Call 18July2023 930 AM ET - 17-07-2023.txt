that may cause actual results to differ materially please refer to our notices regarding forwardlooking statements and non gaap measures that appear in the earnings release this presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent i will now turn the call over to chairman and chief executive officer james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we started the second quarter with significant headwinds and uncertainties and its fair to say that we ended the quarter overall in a better place with a better turn the headwinds reflect the ongoing market transition from a high inflation low rate environment to a higher rate lower inflation environment morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 in addition there was several other issues impacting the markets april started on the heels of the first bank crisis since which had the risk of bleeding into the broader financial system prompt action by regulators and what turned out to be idiosyncratic stories of the failed banks combined with the strength and support from the large us banks helped to rebalance the system second we found our country moving headlong into a debt ceiling crisis while our view was it was likely to be resolved there was no doubt it created unnecessary uncertainty in the markets in april and may thirdly after rapidly rising rates over months the fed reached a pause if not a plateau at its recent meeting and while we may not be quite at the end of rate increases i believe were very very close to it finally strong rhetoric from government leaders from both the us and china in recent weeks is evident and but theres now been recent efforts to normalize relations and a constructive dialogue is surely welcome seeing these four not insignificant macro concerns progress positively supported a more constructive turn in the markets particularly evidenced in the last few weeks of the quarter beyond more macro issues we at morgan stanley completed a significant part of the etrade backoffice integration with the final part to be completed after labor day and were very pleased with how its gone and today we announced new institutional initiatives with japanese research and equity and in foreign exchange with our longstanding partner mufg further evidence of how our businesses can work together over time to best serve our global clients and importantly we received the most recent results of ccar were pleased that our performance under the stress test has improved for the fourth consecutive year every year since the scb was introduced given our strong results we increased our dividend by the same as we did last year that brings our total annual dividend per share to annually with a dividend yield of about given the current stock price as to the financial performance of the firm this quarter certain key metrics were encouraging net new assets in wealth management grew by billion and combined with inflows from investment management we saw over billion bringing our yeartodate net new assets to approximately billion in six months our yeartodate growth is well ahead of pace and while obviously any quarter can bounce around and that will happen our consistent growth in net new assets in wealth management is evidence of our scale and our expanded channels and the clients that we serve second our institutional businesses navigated a choppy environment well and altogether the firm delivered net revenues of over billion up from last year when conditions were very different this translated into an rotce of finally our cet1 ratio was while we knew this would significantly exceed our capital requirements and it did it reflects our desire to remain highly capitalized in the face of the new unfolding basel iii endgame its too early to predict the rate of market improvement through the rest of but the more positive tone in activity seen later in the quarter across many parts of our business is promising of course how much it moves through the balance of the year remains unknown that said the fundamentals of our business model remain strong morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 finally a brief comment on succession at the annual meeting in may i made it clear i would transition out of the ceo role before next years annual meeting succession planning should be intentional and managed just like strategic planning for the firm or any of our critical talent managing talent management processes we are and have been dealing with a number of uncertainties including but not limited to the ccar results business environment basel iii upcoming endgame proposals and certain other pending matters i committed to the board that ill lead our response in those issues and when i do transition out of the ceo role ill remain as executive chairman for a period of time we are fortunate indeed to have three very strong internal candidates that the board continues to evaluate along the appropriate processes for their readiness to stepup as the next ceo of morgan stanley ill now turn the call over to sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and then together well take your questions thank you sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion our eps was and our rotce was reported results include severance charges of approximately million this reduced eps by and rotce by about basis points as james discussed sentiment and activity improved towards the end of the quarter evidenced by green shoots that emerged across our businesses in institutional securities client engagement progressively picked up and in wealth management we witnessed a moderation of sweep outflows as well as a stabilization of retail investments into cash and cash equivalents the firms yeartodate efficiency ratio was in addition to severance expenses for the quarter included million of costs associated with the integrations of etrade and eaton vance approximately of which relates to etrade together severance and this years integration represent an impact of about basis points to the yeartodate efficiency ratio for the balance of the year our expectations for total integration expenses are broadly in line with our prior guidance with approximately million remaining looking towards the back half of we continue to balance investments with the operating environment now to the businesses institutional securities revenues of billion declined versus last year with overall client activity while overall client activity was lower compared to the prior period results improved as the quarter progressed alongside better market conditions investment banking revenues were flat compared to a year ago although advisory remained under pressure a pickup in underwriting supported results advisory revenues of million reflected lower completed ma volumes equity underwriting revenues were million while ipo activity remained muted results were supported by followons and convertibles encouraging signs that equity and equitylinked markets were opened at times for regularway issuance fixed income underwriting revenues were million up yearoveryear driven mostly by investmentgrade bond issuance where corporates and financials took advantage of constructive markets in may and june respectively investmentgrade markets remained resilient against an uncertain backdrop morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 across investment banking client activity trended positively as the quarter progressed the preannounced ma backlog grew consistently throughout the quarter with a potential plateau in rates and lower implied volatility client dialogue is currently active we continue to invest in the franchise and have made selective senior hires to enhance our footprint to best position for the opportunity while we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown and it is hard to know whether positive trends will continue for the nearterm current conditions remain encouraging certainly for the mediumterm outlook and especially for equity revenues were billion down compared to strong results in the previous second quarter due to lower activity and lower market volatility prime brokerage revenues were solid supported by increasing average client balances consistent with rising market levels cash and derivatives declined versus last year on lower global volumes and lower market volatility fixed income revenues of billion decreased compared to last years elevated results solid performance reflects tempered client activity and prudent risk management however improved market conditions in june shifted client sentiment and supported the quarters overall results macro revenues were down yearoveryear attributed to the declines in foreign exchange and a challenging environment and reduced activity partially offset by the pickup in client engagement following the resolution of the debt ceiling debate and performance in rates micro results declined versus last year predominantly on the back of lower client activity results in commodities were down significantly compared to the robust prior year which benefited from volatile energy markets other revenues of million improved versus last year largely driven by lower marktomarket losses net of hedges and higher net interest income and fees on corporate loans heldforsale turning to isg lending and provisions our allowance for credit losses on isg loans and lending commitments increased to billion in the quarter isg provisions were million the increase was driven by continued negative outlooks for commercial real estate and modest portfolio growth net chargeoffs were million and were substantially all from a handful of specific loans from our corporate lending portfolio turning to wealth management revenues were billion a record excluding the high the impact of dcp revenues were billion and increased supported by higher net interest income results demonstrate the strength of the business model and our ability to continue to serve clients throughout different market environments pretax profit was billion with a pbt margin of severance charges were million and integration related expenses were million taken together and with the impact of dcp these three factors were a drag on the margin of approximately basis points despite the challenging market backdrop the business model continued to deliver against our core objectives most notably wealth management delivered billion of net new assets demonstrating our platforms ability to grow in various market environments net new assets were driven by our advisorled channel existing client consolidation and net recruiting were strong and offset seasonal taxrelated outflows in april our early investments in technology including data and ai are providing advisors with tools to service current clients better and more efficiently prospect new business including from our workplace channel morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 also significant as james mentioned we are pleased to share that we have accomplished an integral part of etrades backoffice integration converting over million etrade accounts to morgan stanleys unified platform we did this with virtually no client disruption which has always been a critical priority we expect to finish our integration efforts on time in the second half of this year moving to our business metrics in the second quarter performance was solid down the line in light of the environment asset management revenues were billion down versus last years second quarter primarily reflecting lower market levels transactional revenues were million excluding the impact of dcp revenues declined yearoveryear reflective of lower client activity for most of the quarter feebased flows were billion bank lending balances grew by billion driven by mortgages offsetting pay downs in securitiesbased lending total deposits of billion were up slightly quarteroverquarter sweep outflows moderated during may and june compared to april which included seasonal tax outflows the recent months trends are encouraging but it remains too early to be declarative net interest income of billion was virtually flat versus the prior quarter the impact of lower sweep balances and higher funding costs were offset by higher rates looking towards the rest of the year we do not expect nii to expand results will be a function of our deposit mix and the trajectory of various rates similar to the institutional business retail sentiment improved as the quarter progressed for the first time since the beginning of the year june saw positive monthly flows into equity markets from advisorled sweep balances we are encouraged by this more recent activity and remain wellpositioned to support ongoing asset growth and our clients through market cycles turning to investment management revenues of billion declined from the prior second quarter primarily reflecting lower performancebased income and the cumulative impact of lower asset levels over the course of the year commensurate with the market environment asset management and related fees were billion declining yearoveryear reflecting the stability and diversification of our client franchise performancebased income and other revenues declined yearoveryear due to the challenging investing environment in certain asset classes and markets such as real estate and asia private equity solid performance in other areas of our private alternative strategies acted as a partial offset reflecting the diversity of our platform and our capitallight clientdriven alternative franchise total aum increased trillion our integration with eaton vance continues to progress well integrationrelated expenses were million in the quarter longterm net flows were positive inflows were driven by ongoing demand in alternatives and solutions which offset outflows in equities and fixed income within alternatives and solutions parametric customized portfolios private credit and private equity continue excuse me remain consistent sources of net inflows underscoring the benefits of our diverse platform additionally this quarter alternatives and solutions benefited from a significant inflow related to a portfolio solutions mandate liquidity and overlay services had an inflows of billion supported by ongoing demand for money market funds we continue to be very wellpositioned in secular growth areas such as customization and private markets across geographies and with our global client base morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 turning to the balance sheet total spot assets decreased billion from the prior quarter to trillion our standardized cet1 ratio was up approximately basis points versus the prior quarter standardized rwas declined about billion from the prior quarter to billion due to market conditions and continued prudent resource management recent stress test results reaffirmed our strong capital position and our durable business model we announced a quarterly dividend increase of and renewed our billion multiyear repurchase authorization our tax rate was for the quarter reflecting our global mix of earnings while we outperformed our tax guidance in the first half we expect a tax rate of approximately in the second half of this year consistent with our initial guidance although we cannot be sure how the backdrop will play out for the rest of our priority as a management team is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities should stable and higher asset levels prevail wealth and investment management are poised to benefit particularly as we continue to attract net new assets a testament to our asset growth strategy within institutional securities while advisory will lag the financing market the backlog is building and underwriting trends are positive open and functioning markets remain key to supporting client conviction and activity levels most critically our business continues to advance our clear and consistent firm strategy driving longterm growth while remaining wellcapitalized with that we will now open the line up to questions question and answer section operator we are now ready to take in questions operator instructions well take our first question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so just maybe first question james for you thanks for the update on the succession as we think about what youve built in terms of the franchise and i think you talked about the unfolding basel endgame rules that are expected over the next week or two from a shareholder perspective do you see these rules as gamechanging where investors will have to reevaluate the value proposition of morgan stanley as a franchise and you as a management team would have to review strategic targets that youve laid out give us a sense and i know plenty of unknowns but i think the question we get from shareholders is the comfort around the ability of the firm to manage through what could be pretty radical changes morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well its an important question and youre right i have made comments on it lets sort of set the table where we are right now weve had a lot of speculation based off of what the basel iii endgame looks like by the way im not sure its actually being implemented fully in europe just to say that i think the us banks actually have more capital but putting that niche aside we did get the speech from the vice chair i think its important to look at the title of that speech which was holistic capital review so its taking into account all of the ccar stress tests scb buffers and the like as this stuff is implemented secondly we havent seen the actual rules i mean i guess therell be a proposal coming out as you said in a couple weeks there will be an extensive comment period there is clearly very different views as to the needs of us banking system to a accrete more capital in fact if you look at the test for the last few years the what happened with the regional banks what silicon valley first republic signature what happened during covid whats happened during this period of higher high inflation whats happened with the biggest rate increase weve had in years put all that together the us large banks actually did really well in fact if not all of them certainly for morgan stanley our capital position improved four years in a row under ccar so its kind of hard for me to sit here and say that we wont be commenting forcefully that we are very wellcapitalized but therell be an extensive comment period i suspect what comes out of that will not be the same as what starts i think in the sausagemaking therell be a lot of evaluation clearly the intent is not to harm the us banking system which is the backbone of the economy its to strengthen us then therell be a long transition period so i just i happen to be reading the speech from the vice chair in last couple days and he had a paragraph in there anticipating this question i thought id read to you any proposed changes would go through the standard noticeandcomment rulemaking process allowing for all interested parties appropriate time any final changes to capital requirements would occur with appropriate transition times and he goes on again later in his speech to point out it could be it will not be fully effective for some years so here we are in i dont think this is going to happen in any meaningful way before the end of i think what comes out a year from now after comment period will be very different from what goes in and just take my personal peeve in it which is applying a standardized rwa hit on operating risk as the various regulators try and figure out what the right way to assess operating risk capital is and to put a standardized hit is fine but to do it based on fee income which is the current european proposal seems to me to be nuts i mean were not you dont build feebased businesses to create operating risk you build them to create stability so thats a point weve made very clear with the regulators and i think theyre taking it under consideration so long story short yes its the final thrust its ironic i dont believe all the european banks are complying with their own rules we have a very healthy robust capital system here thats been tested years in a row morgan stanley has done well and there is no chance therell be a major strategic shift for morgan stanley as a result of any of this is my conclusion ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that is helpful and nuts sounds about right one quick question sharon for you you mentioned nii not seen as expanding from here i guess is it implied in the expectation that nii should stabilize in the back half give or take within a few percentage points morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley it will depend really ebrahim thanks for the question itll really depend on deposit mix and so as i mentioned there were encouraging signs in terms of that mix as we think about the back half of the quarter but that liability mix whats going on with sweeps will be the primary driver when you think about nii in the nearterm operator well move to our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey thanks good morning i just want to touch on the institutional securities and you had ultimately i think a pretty good quarter relative to the backdrop and you mentioned that engagement really accelerated kind of towards to the back half of the quarter so im assuming kind of on the other side of the debt ceiling debate things started to normalize a little bit so just want to talk about some of the puts and takes and whether maybe the second quarter results which are still the softest results i think since second quarter this is kind of a more normal outcome or if you actually think that what you saw kind of in that recovery in the back half of the quarter is a normalization and so therefore we could actually bounce back from the outcome of the second quarter thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure lets take all of isg first so when we think about what weve discussed a lot at length really about normal postcovid has been so for the overall isg wallet to land between and our view there broadly has not changed in terms of where we expect ourselves to be weve laid out pretty clear sort of market share guidelines in terms of where we are from a wallet perspective when you look specifically you talked about fixed income weve moved from wallet share to wallet share so i think the dramatic change that weve made in that business has really been around a clientcentric franchise and making sure that were there and able to be able to service our client base what we talked about as you highlight is that there was less client activities for us this second quarter compared to last years second quarter but interestingly as you mentioned and youre right we saw a dramatic change in that activity level specifically in fixed income right after the debt ceiling debate so i think what were looking to do is capture our fair share of the wallet and that overall wallet in terms of normalization we think will likely land between and devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great color there and then just in terms of just this green shoot and kind of normalization theme we are seeing in the equity capital markets debt capital markets some normalization ma still been pretty lackluster and so just curious whether you just feel like maybe thats more on a lagged basis as capital markets recover then ma recovery would come next or is there something else kind of idiosyncratic to that market that may hold back results in that business thanks morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah remember that of course advisory is always going to be lagged just because of the announcements so were digesting the fact that we had very muted or a dearth of announcements if we look back six nine months if we think about the last month of the quarter weve began to see more announcements and were seeing that really in sectors specific that have a strategic dialogue around them so be that financials where you might see industry consolidation energy where youre seeing transitional discussions and reasons to actually have strategic dialogues so what gives us confidence is that youre seeing a broadening out of those strategic dialogues our backlog is building and were seeing it across various sectors were having both backlog and discussions but it is fair to say that advisory will likely lag simply because you are dealing with a lagged announcement pipeline from the last six to nine months operator well move to our next question from glenn schorr with evercore isi group your line is now open please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so i want to drill down a little bit more on the billion i know it can be lumpy but i didnt think it was tootoo workplace produced but i wonder if you could drill down a little bit of on what happened to work so well this quarter and this first half of the year i mean it bodes well for your doubling of pretax margins im sorry doubling of pretax income for wealth but just curious on whats contributing to the good lumpiness lately obviously well ahead of your trillion every threeyear pace sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you so much glenn for the question and yes i think referencing andys speech that he gave for those of you who may not be aware is helpful because it is an assetled strategy when we think about where we see expansion in that business going forward this particular quarter historically over the long term weve generally said no one channel is contributing to over of nna interestingly this quarter we did see the advisorled channel was a big proponent and more than that it was what was a big production part of the funnel was the assets held away from existing clients its been a strategy that weve been talking about back through or so and we put out a number of tools the modern wealth toolkit et cetera to give advisors more time to begin to not only prospect new clients but also really offer their existing clients better advice and so thats where i think youre beginning to see a lot of that work in terms of aggregating assets held away and we continue to believe that thats a real opportunity for us to grow our asset base james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i just want to add on this a little bit because its obviously been a focus of mine for many decades the run rate glenn as you know for the three years before this was trillion so were running about 330ish billion in a year this year run rate if you standard would obviously be higher than that itd be around billion but i morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 think youre right its going its going to be lumpy i mean youre going to have a quarter in here somewhere thats a billion quarter and i wouldnt get too excited about that and just as i dont get too excited were ahead of the run rate what i really care about what im really excited about is its a real thing this is not just something thats going to stop weve got a lot of wealthy clients just the dividends the interest they get on their accounts the money they bring in the migration from the workplace the migration from the etrade accounts its the real deal and its i know we put out this trillion number which i think is i think this is going to happen and at a increase in the value annually on the portfolio with trillion every three years it happens in a bit over five years and its just a pretty much unstoppable force but there will be lumpiness in it im sure of that i dont know when but they will be lumpy this happened to be a great one and im excited about it i think were heading to were clearly heading to trillion which is at basis points billion in revenue and if you do the math compounding and i know people are going to call me crazy and i know its the end of my tenure so i get to do this kind of stuff but if you do over years you end up at trillion which is billion revenue business well that seems like a long way out but i started this job years ago and we had much much fewer than the trillion we have today so its possible glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi wow maybe just one quickie sharon you talked about sweeps and its too early to tell if weve settled in im curious if you have any stats you can share on what percentage of fas andor what percentage of clients have accounted for most of the moving im not sure what to root for here but curious on how widespread across the fa and client base the shifts have been or concentrated sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah the in terms of the shift in terms of moving out of sweeps into savings or seeing savings products we still have over of our actual deposit base thats coming from our own client base whats interesting in terms of the movement of sweeps which might be your question im not sure im totally answering it glenn is that we began to see some of those sweeps not just remember we used to see them move into money markets or other cash alternatives in june we began to see some of those dollars actually move into markets so various assets we hadnt seen that trend since january so that just shows that some of the clients are actually also deploying excess cash or cash equivalents actually into the marketplace as well operator for our next question well move to steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so james james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley steven morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc i appreciate your comments on basel iii endgame might be helpful if you could just speak to how the lengthy transition period informs your nearterm buyback appetite if at all and given the rwa inflation could be quite meaningful what are some of the mitigating actions you can pursue to alleviate some of the pressure on your businesses james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well again i think steve weve got to see the rule proposed first i mean without talking out of school ive clearly had conversations with all the appropriate regulatory bodies and im encouraged by their response which is they sincerely want to hear comments from the industry they do understand capital changes across our whole industry have to result in the right economic outcome for the country and by definition the bank stability as evidenced by the recent many years of ccars shows that the gsib banks the top eight banks for sure are wellcapitalized so i dont want to get ahead and talk about what wed mitigate clearly we have flexibility around our rwas we do you saw that this quarter we ended up with cet1 we did that not really from a basel iii perspective i mean we had that in the back of our mind but more from this environment it was a little squirrely i mean lets just say it you had three bank fails at the beginning of the quarter that wasnt a good look so we wanted to be cautious and on the specific buyback obviously just on the dividend were totally comfortable with the dividend weve said many many times we regard half the companys a yield stock and were going to treat it that way and the dividend increases youve seen i think theyre entirely appropriate and i would expect they continue over the coming years without saying exactly what level theyre at on the buyback i mean we would advantage of weakness in the stock we will be prudent were accreting this was a very difficult quarter and we accreted billion so its not like were not making money here and id like to see the rule i guess in a couple weeks sharon right were getting the rule and then the first range of comments well be doing buybacks through this year we have billion authorization from the board we might be doing billion but well be doing buybacks and well moderate it i think this thing is going to take as i said id be surprised if this is all done and dusted by where are we by the end of i think thats sort of a and thats threeandahalf years which is a lifetime in these industries steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no its a fair point james i mean admittedly we all had the experience of basel iii when it wasnt going to get fully implemented for a period of years and the impacts were fully loaded so i think were all just trying to prepare for maybe some expectation that it gets priced in a little bit more quickly james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley it could it could and well adapt but we wont change our strategy and im morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc sure james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley going to be a strong advocate on where i think some of these rules do not align with what is right for the global for the us financial system and the us economy not just morgan stanleys selfinterest steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no helpful perspective if i could squeeze in one more here just on investment management the margin goal that youve laid out for wealth and im wealth when we adjust for the specials of about bps youre within spitting distance of that the investment management margin its running in the midteens and i recognize youre still integrating eaton vance but what are your margin aspirations for that business and what are some of the actions youre taking to maybe help close that gap sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so steve the margin goals that weve given have been really around wealth management i respect your point though we have given larger efficiency targets for the firm and so there are places where youll have puts and takes between isg and im remember if we look back less than months ago or so we did we were close to margins in the im business so what weve seen over the course of the last year or so has just been the cumulative impact of the outflows associated with changes in what investor appetite was particularly around active equity but also just the asset levels themselves that are associated with market whats important to us is the diversification of the platform and then continuing to invest in where we see real structural changes in that business and i mean by that business i mean more broadly in an industry landscape so things like customization consistently every quarter regardless of what weve seen sort of on the top line we continue to see increased flows net inflows on the customization products you saw we talked about a solutionsbased product this additional quarter so were leaning into where we see industry opportunities and as we grow assets similar to us growing assets on the wealth management side that should help support the margin for the investment management business which we do see as a throughthecycle business operator well move to our next question from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley you there brennan operator mr hawken your line is now open sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley operator maybe we go to the next one and come back to brennan morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 operator well move to the next question from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well this is the first chance we have to ask you about the ceo change james and just why james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley mike you asked me about ceo change in mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey you know james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley so its actually your second chance to ask me mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah well you survived and thrived so there you go indiscernible james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well thank you i appreciate that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc but its this is wall street and what have you done for us lately and whats going to happen ahead so first i dont understand what executive chairman is and i do hope you have inperson shareholder meetings again like you did in the past and what will that mean when youre executive chairman and what is your thought process on timing of the new ceo and what are your considerations i mean we can all go through the candidates that we see in the press but lets just hear it from you directly what youre thinking and what the boards thinking who ultimately makes that decision james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well to take a few of those pieces were not going to have inperson shareholder meetings since the years ive did this before covid we had more people from security than we did shareholders physically in the meetings so lets just be honest it was an enormous waste of time and money and while one or two people might ask like asking a question in person i just dont think its a good use of time and money but that along with my pet peeve that we shouldnt have quarterly earnings reports they should be every six months would be two immediate changes i would make if i was god of finance but thats not what you really asked about morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 on the ceo stuff i mean mike wed id said about five years ago id step down in about five years i said three years ago itd be three years and nobody believed me so i said the best way to get people to believe and the board agreed with this strategy was at the annual meeting to say i wont be on the job at the next annual meeting so that makes it very clear its months were already two months into it when exactly that happens frankly just isnt that relevant i mean whether it happens tomorrow it happens on may whatever it is 15th or something next annual meeting its irrelevant itll happen somewhere between those dates theres a few things i think just given my tenure i can probably get done that will help the new ceo get off to a great start and that is my intent i want somebody to do this job as well better than ive done it for the next several years and to thrive in it and the best way to help them is to get them off to a good start so the exact timing will be just driven by that obviously given the questions here on basel iii endgame thats an important thing for me to dig into over the next few months we just got the ccar stuff done we got the dividend done were chipping away at what id call the remaining pieces the board will ultimately decide we have a process its a committee the comp management development and succession committee chaired by dennis nally runs that process it reports to the board obviously and the full board will ultimately choose the next ceo and im sure at some point theyll want my formal input on that but theyre doing their process as they should independently and i think its very healthy so the criteria you look for obviously not necessarily whos the best business operator running a given business on a given day but whos best equipped to deal with the multiple constituencies and challenges of running a global bank and thats what the board will figure out so saying more than that i think would be inappropriate because it gets ahead of the boards process and thats their job and im just here to help along the way so hopefully that clarifies it mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah just one followup so the at least i guess theres three contenders the three heads of the business lines if thats correct and i guess that means maybe two people dont get the job whats a good technique for your firm or any firm to make sure that those people who dont get the top job are still made part still stay with the firm and feel a part of everything thats happening james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley wall streets had a history of that not happening i think we will frankly we will challenge that history we have an unbelievable team that worked together for at least eight years i think theyve all been on the operating committee and we have an unbelievable team of executives around them sharon who youre hearing on this call eric grossman our chief legal officer clare woodman who runs europe middle east and so on and so on so we have a lot of very talented executives thatll be for myself frankly to help navigate that path but these jobs are enormous jobs whether its ceo or president or coo of these global companies and were one of the largest companies in the world so im confident well end up in a great place mike operator well move to our next question from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hopefully you can hear me now james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley go brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc all right sorry about that before so sharon i know you mentioned before about the nii and the deposit cost having a big impact but actually the deposit cost trends were roughly in line with what we were looking for and yet nii turned out to be a little better than expected could you tell us we dont have great visibility on the asset side did something happen on the asset side were you able to reprice some assets and how much more of that do we have potentially on the come sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley there were some places where we benefited from the asset side but as you know well have to look at the alm mix and it will be dependent on some of the market rates that we see going forward so unfortunately theres not that much more clarity i can give you other than what is leading us as we go forward is largely that liability mix and so thats the trend that will when we look out in the next couple of quarters is one of the biggest trends that will drive nii from here brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then i noticed i know it can diverge sometimes but the trends for firmwide nii were different down about million quarteroverquarter so could you help us maybe understand why it was that the firmwide nii differed substantially from the wealth management trends sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yes that was largely just associated with the trading position and as you know it depends on many things including what products you have where theyre booked how theyre booked and what type of instrument and in addition various types of funding costs so its really the i think when we look and we manage the business specifically on the trading side given our portfolio and how we think about our bank versus just the broader brokerdealer et cetera we dont manage it on an nii basis when were looking at nii nii is clearly a driver for the wealth management side operator well move to our next question from dan fannon with jefferies your line is now open please go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 thanks good morning another question on wealth and acknowledging the strong nna number in aggregate but what do you think we need to see for the feebased nna to begin to get closer in size to the total nna and maybe what you think longerterm that mix will look like sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley great question weve looked a lot at feebased and thought about sort of as we think about the funnel one thing that we highlighted to you last year or last quarter rather was that from the advisorled side we still had around of those assets in cash and cash equivalents that is a historical average of the last five years was around so in our mind a lot of it has to do with the way that people are looking at the markets right now and the idea that when youre moving into a feebased asset specifically on the retail side you are doing so and youre actually obviously actively investing in different market assets and so what is encouraging is as i highlighted on i think to the question glenn asked is that in the last month of the quarter we began to see individuals individual retail clients actually put that money into markets so thats an encouraging sign but we do think that a portion of that is market dependent daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you operator well move to our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is now open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning sharon can you give us some color when the etrade deal was closed i think it was back in october one of the real attractions i think for morgan stanley was the workplace channel and you guys are obviously a dominant player in this workplace channel are there any metrics that you can share with us on the success youre having in increasing the penetration in that channel sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yes weve talked a lot in the last two quarterly updates around just the movement that we see in terms of channel migration is what weve called it so workplace assets that are then some portion of it is moved into the advisorled side and then from that sort of as a core you see assets held away beginning to come in for the first three years that we had that that number was around billion so call it billion a quarter and then in the first quarter of this year we were for that one quarter we saw billion and when you look at the first half were largely running almost up to a full year rate of last year and so what that puts into account is we are seeing encouraging signs we dont know exactly where that number will land but obviously its trending in a good direction and what it shows again is that workplace can begin to be sort of a seed to the conversation that people have with advisors and you see that being of the assets that are brought in through the migration the other or so are coming in from assets held away morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then and james just to circle back to the capital comments that you made with the basel iii endgame and weve heard from some of your peers about the engagement with the regulators appears to be stronger this time maybe than in past can you share with us your feelings when you think about what you guys all went through post the financial crisis and the new regulations that came from doddfrank do you think the regulators are really listening to you folks more so this time than in the past or is that not the case james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well i think gerard its early were we need to see the rule the test of the theres one thing to listen and theres another thing to listen and act the test is once the regulatory committee receives feedback from the industry groups which are very coordinated i will say what input do they take into account frankly how do we compare what the european banks have done on their own regulations so i think bringing the us to sort of a goldplated european standard just doesnt feel to me like the right end outcome i think we should do whats right for the us financial system yes i think theyre listening theyve shown an interest in a strong interest in getting the feedback from the industry the communities the legislative bodies et cetera so but the proof will be in the pudding well find out over next i dont know how long it will take the comment period im assuming it could be a year or so i mean this is a big deal remember basel iii endgame first proposed in so its taken it six years to make its way in a small sailing boat across the atlantic and here it is so now weve got to decide what we like about it what we dont so im maintaining a constructive tone because i think everybody wants to end up in the right place i dont happen to think and this is contrary to some peoples views that silicon valley first republic have a whole lot to do with this stuff but thats a different discussion for a later day so yeah i would hope and expect that theyre going to listen because they we should be listening to each other operator for our next question well move to andrew lim with soc gen please go ahead andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to circle back again on basel iii as well so id note your comments about european banks having maybe a bit more work to do a lot of them are guiding towards impacts on a constant basis at the lowend though sort of like below basis points so i was just wondering if you saw something a bit more specific that might level the playing field for the european banks versus the us banks debate and then turning over to the us banks obviously were all familiar with the large impacts that have been talked about by jerome powell and michael barr one of your competitors was a bit more forthcoming saying that that might allude to operational riskweighted assets being added to total standardized riskweighted assets which currently isnt the case under the standardized approach so i was wondering if you had any like specific thoughts about that or whether you thought that was a bit more a bit less relevant given that that would allude to legacy rmbs losses from many years ago how do you think about that morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well im not going to go into more detail about the european banks i was just observing that their system was set up many years ago under basel the european banks some of which are fully compliant with it and some are not yet and the country system was set up in the us of ccar so weve actually had a capital stress test system for at least i dont know years or something so that was simply the observation on the operational risk standardized approach to riskweighted assets yes there actually that is very clearly going to be in the proposal that is the basel iii proposal and that is going to be in the initial readout i think from the us proposal where that ends up ive made my position very clear on that ph that their tying standardized rwas to feebased business is not just doesnt make sense to me so up until now weve had idiosyncratic evaluation of specific bank operational risk and the regulators are trying to move to a standardized approach how they get there when we get there remains a lot to be seen a lot of work to be done on that operator there are no
