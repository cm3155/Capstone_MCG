families and your colleagues are safe and sound we appreciate your participation this morning and believe youll find that our first quarter results demonstrate once again tristate capitals proven model and growth strategy we are entering the current environment at our strongest position ever this differentiated model has been perfected over the last years during good times and bad the agile nature of our business with unwavering focus on sophisticated clients in highly targeted markets has delivered consistent performance across different environments founded in at the beginning of the great recession growing the income statement and balance sheet year after year tristate capital has been profitable in every single quarter since the fourth quarter of the balance sheet is pushing on billion of assets having surpassed billion during the first quarter we surpassed billion just six months ago all through our wellestablished lines of business and purely organic responsible growth the balance sheet is strong healthy and liquid superior credit metrics are a product of the intentional selection of clients market segments and products giving a very attractive risk profile along with the credit team that is as experienced and disciplined as any youll find in the business our diversified funding platform produced a record level of over billion in onbalance sheet liquidity the relationshipdriven funding mechanism enabled us to grow deposit balances by annualized during the first quarter the balance sheet is also flexible illustrated by the repricing for nearly all of our floating rate deposits and the interest rate floors has put on more than of the loans both in response to last months cuts and the target fed funds rate our chartwell national investment management unit our national private banking business and our regional middle market business are designed to provide us with diverse revenue streams across operating environments again they delivered in the first quarter for example organic net interest income growth was annualized on stable net interest margin and annualized loan growth at the same time record swap fees helped to balance investment management income that was dampened by march market volatility offsetting positive net client asset inflows together these three businesses generated record quarterly revenue organically growing the top line by annualized pretax income grew annualized all in a first quarter display that was the exceptional for some financial services companies for tristate capital its representative of what this company is built to deliver this consistent performance comes even as we move most of our employees to remote working environments through their exceptional efforts combined with the systems digital high end experience and scalable infrastructure weve invested in for years weve been able to help our clients through the historic challenges in the first quarter even as tristate capital sales and clientfacing professionals were limited in meeting facetoface with clients in recent weeks i believe this company has never been closer to its clients than in the last days this is not by tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 accident in march we implemented a proactive plan to communicate with our entire client base ensure that we understood their concerns and needs and addressed them accordingly asset quality has long been a differentiator for tristate capital and that has never been more important than it is right now as many of you know our company does not serve retail banking customers or market consumer or traditional residential mortgage loans nonperforming loans and adverserated credits on march were essentially unchanged from the end of last year npls totaled just on a billion loan portfolio adverserated credits of less than million at quarter end made up just basis points of total loans no additional credits were moved to the adverserated category private banking loans represented of total loans at quarter end and are primarily collateralized by marketable securities these are monitored on a daily basis through our proprietary technology are liquid overcollateralized and subject to favorable treatment under regulatory capital requirements the private banking portfolio is approaching billion and grew on an annualized basis during the first quarter commercial real estate loans totaled billion increasing annualized during the quarter commercial and industrial loans hit a record billion an increase of annualized from the fourth quarter roughly million or less than a third of our ci growth in the quarter was attributed to net increased utilization of revolving commercial credit lines as weve grown our portfolio we should know that were doing so with very strong and high quality borrowers through our private banking business tristate capital is the nations premier provider of nonpurpose margin loans marketed through financial intermediaries we had extensive engagement with thousands of investment advisers and trust officers about loan requirements as they manage portfolios in periods of historic volatility as a result limited cure activity was required and this was fulfilled in an orderly fashion yeartodate through april we required maintenance cures on loans or approximately of our private bank accounts compared this to the fourth quarter of when we required cures on of accounts when volatility was high but nothing like march of we still are happy to report that we have not had to force the liquidation of any accounts for clients to meet the cure obligations for tristate capitals private banking loans its important to keep a few data points in mind about the portfolio the average loan size was less than the median loantovalue ratio across the portfolio was approximately given the collateral cushion we maintain beyond the maintenance cure level and the private banking portfolio has maintained its zeroloss history since inception to give you a sense of the demand for this offering from high net worth clients and the investment advisers and trust officers we market them through look at our applications in the first quarter of our team processed new record private banking loan applications or an increase of from the first quarter of when we generated applications in march alone we processed private banking loan applications and in the first days of april we had applications benefiting from the past investments weve made in developing our digital loan platform that has allowed financial intermediaries and their clients to easily engage with tristate capital in the current environment on the commercial side we have an incredibly strong team serving middlemarket clients across our ph four state footprint who know this company our clients and our market very well beginning in february we saw the early aspects of the quarantine starting to develop we began client outreach efforts to understand the impact of covid19 situation we also organized a credit strategy committee comprised of leaders from credit legal finance operations and compliance so that we could develop responsive action plans tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 we had been talking with every one of our commercial borrowers about their experiences their expectations for the future and any need for additional solutions to help them through this situation our lender team is made up of highly qualified professionals who average years of experience about half of them with tristate capital for over five years they maintain close relationships with each of our clients and are able to make each of these conversations deep and meaningful from these focused conversations with our commercial clients we develop customized solutions where something was needed to help them in connection with this effort through april we have developed deferral arrangements with fewer than loans totaling approximately million and representing less than of our billion of total loans we view these arrangements as investments investments and relationships with high quality organizations some of which have banked with us for more than years these investments are designed to help them weather the storm get back to work with the sea is calm and enable them to succeed and bank with us for another decade our commercial clients and projects are well diversified by industry and property type through strong sponsors and relationships this diversity is also enhanced by the granularity in the portfolio which is assisted by our ph preferred hold level of million for commercial loan a majority of our commercial real estate lending is incomeproducing real estate including in multifamily or apartment projects another is construction or land and at about is in owneroccupied projects within our billion ci portfolio our largest lending category is financial services and insurance comprising of ci loans another is in service including healthcare waste management remediation administration and other service industries for real estate related services such as portfolio and property managers is manufacturing and is transportation and the remainder is spread across a variety of industries importantly we have limited our exposure to some of the frontline types of business that may be most immediately impacted by covid19 social distancing and quarantines for example our billion commercial loan portfolio includes only million to hotels million to related to restaurant operations million to senior housing and other healthcarerelated real estate and million to nonrenewable energy distribution and production and about million to projects with retail component each of which we have underwritten with strong sponsors poured in recourse further we have maintained our disciplined approach of focusing on commercial lending opportunities with our fourstate midatlantic region where our team has deep experience and relationships at the same time weve worked to keep our commercial loans broadly distributed across these markets and our commercial credit verticals and strategies continue to be aligned with our deposit and treasury management verticals and strategies tristate capital continues to be well capitalized under regulatory requirements we review our capital ratios in the context of our business model and credit quality meaning that we believe that the very strong credit quality of our portfolio and the amount of noninterest income especially from chartwell business requires less capital cushion and provides a more efficient use of capital than other billion to billion asset banks while we are comfortable with our capital levels at the holding company we are exploring fixed income opportunities to bolster capital at the bank level to support our ongoing and exceptional loan growth and maintain excess liquidity we are considering a perpetual preferred offering or subordinated debt both of which weve executed previously as well as senior notes and intend to execute on one of these options this year as we noted in yesterdays news release tristate capital elected to defer the implementation of cecl in accordance with relief provided under the cares act we conducted a thorough analysis and determined that at this time delaying was the right choice for this company continued application of the incurred loss that resulted in tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 reserve levels of million or basis points of our total commercial loans these levels are nearly identical to what we would have reported had we implemented cecl in the quarter tristate capitals unique loan portfolio which is collateralized by private banking loans primarily backed by marketable securities will not require reserve for credit loss under cecl as i mentioned earlier in my comments nearly all of our floating rate deposits were repriced in march aligned with prevailing federal reserve rates and floors are in place in more than of our total loans active management of interest rate risk is enabled by the deliberate construction of our flexible balance sheet most of our deposits are variable rate linked to indices or priced at rates set by the bank at our discretion for loans are floating rate and primarily indexed to 30day libor turning to our investment management business chartwell generated fees of million comprising of noninterest income during the first quarter of while new business and new flows from existing accounts were offset by outflows and market depreciation we reported net inflows of million during the first quarter today chartwell has an excess of million in institutional commitments in its new business pipeline most of which we expect to fund before the end of the second quarter as we shared with you in january last year chartwell took active measures to lower expenses by the end of last year chartwell had reduced its annual expense run rate by more than million accordingly it also lowered its expenses in the first quarter of versus both the linked and the yearago periods and ebitda improved in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of weve confidence in our investment managers unique product offering and highly credible performance its outstanding distribution capability the talented people leading its funds and their ability to attract business our goal is to profitably grow this business across operating environments accelerating this progress when the broader economy and financial markets improve tristate capitals resilient business model was designed to thrive in all operating environments and our first quarter performance underscores the strength of our proven approach its a model that our companys leadership stands behind fully we believe that tsc shares are dramatically undervalued even in the current market accordingly executives and directors acquired more than  of tristate capital stock in the first three months of with of those shares purchased in march weve a solid balance sheet evergrowing income statement and robust new business pipelines for our loan deposit and investment management offerings the strategic steps weve taken in recent years and months to make this company more nimble efficient innovative and position us well to help lead our clients through the challenges of from the position of strength in order to continue delivering value to our shareholders over the long term before we open up the call to qa i want to emphasize that we would not be where we are today without the talented people we have across this organization individuals who joined tristate capital and chartwell are successful before they ever walk through our doors we provide them the entrepreneurial environment the team culture and the resources they need to flourish in the last days their abilities and commitment our clients have never been more apparent today i simply could not be prouder of the entire team than i am today that concludes my prepared remarks this morning ill now ask dave to join me for qa operator please open the line tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question is from michael schiavone of kbw please go ahead michael schiavone q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning guys thanks for taking my question james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning mike michael schiavone q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so while we understand the lower risk nature of the balance sheet is there any minimum tangible common equity ratio that the board is comfortable running at james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc i would say mike nothing like that has been clearly established we and in fact review that all the time with the board and we feel comfortable where we are thats the question youre asking at this point david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc were really focused on bank capital levels if you look across our three businesses youve got the asset manager which only really requires capital for acquisition purposes to grow through acquisition youve got the private bank which really only requires capital for leverage purposes the private banking portfolio does not require an allowance and so it doesnt require riskbased capital and then youve got the traditional commercial bank which is about billion of loans that requires traditional riskbased capital and so we really focus on tier leverage at the bank and were comfortable with those levels at the quarter end as jim mentioned we will access the capital markets at some point this year but we really have a unique holding company much different than the traditional pure billion to billion institution in that weve got two businesses asset management and banking and more than half the banking business doesnt require riskbased capital james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc and keep in mind the asset manager throws off approximately million of revenue a year michael schiavone q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 okay thats helpful thank you and then on the reserve build in the quarter on the commercial book it was a bit lower than your peers they have reported so far can you provide some detail around the economic assumptions used in our credit models at this time david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah so let me maybe start by saying i think youll agree that our asset quality speaks for itself asset quality and underwriting in the past years weve only charged off millions worth of loans in the past five years weve charged off million worth of loans so our asset quality historically has been much better than peers as i mentioned a minute ago more than half of our bank is marketable securities base loans over collateralized by those types of securities the remaining portfolio of of ci commercial and industrial and commercial real estate has an allowance thats effectively basis points against those loans which is comparable to other institutions that are highly thought of such as first republic importantly we dont have any retail loans we dont have any credit cards with no mortgages or other retail exposure thats really driven cecl provisions and as jim outlined we dont have significant exposure to industries that are currently in distress hospitality restaurants hotels and energy he also mentioned that proactively weve been in touch with every single one of our commercial credit clients in the past days to understand how theyre doing and whether they need to seek help through deferral loan payments now well remind you that we only have of nonperforming loans so weve looked at this carefully weve gotten to a conclusion both through the moodys cecl model that we use in our incurred loss model that arrives at the same place we feel good about where we sit weve been focused on unemployment and gdp to answer your question specifically in terms of the economic drivers that were looking at for both incurred and cecl and i would expect that youll see us continue to build reserves in the second quarter but we feel good about where we are today operator the next question is from steve moss of b riley fbr please go ahead james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc hi good morning let me start i guess with just where are your funding costs as of march and kind of also in a related area what are you thinking about loan spreads these days or where are loan spreads and start there david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning steve so as jim mentioned we put floors in on a lot of our loans private banking specifically and new commercial loans and so what were looking at were going to give you some allin numbers all in for commercial loans yields of about all in yields for private banking loans of about we will as jim mentioned carry excess liquidity through the end of the year deposit cost weve been able to moderate quite well in the quarter some immediate pricing adjustments and so youll see deposit cost anywhere from just slightly under libor to effectively basis points now so we feel good about being able to bend the cost curve with respect to deposits tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay and just with the floors i mean to ask how long whats the duration of those floors david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc theres no duration theyre just there until we have a fundamental change in the rate environment james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah these loans are all demand notes and theyre set up to meet the clients needs so overwhelmingly were talking about the private banking portfolio here but were doing the same thing on the commercial banking putting floors on any of the new loans that were putting in place and its about of the loan portfolio as floors on steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay and then with regard to cecl here just wondering how do we think about the delay do you think about going effective april or further out thanks david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so the sec came out with some guidance indiscernible provided for this deferral of cecl but we really needed the sec to provide guidance because thats the standard setter and their requirement was that if we delay the implementation of cecl we would implement on the earlier day of when the government lists the emergency declaration so in that quarter or at the earlier of those two dates and so it will be implemented either at some point this year or at the very latest at the end of the year operator the next question is from daniel tamayo of raymond james please go ahead james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys can you provide a little more detail on the million of deferred loans just in terms of what segments those come from james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah its fairly diversified dan and theres of them these are businesses keep in mind that essentially the government shut these businesses down and so its a combination of principal and interest not for goodness deferral and theyre either signed up for three months or six months and as we mentioned we aggressively went tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 out and talked to the clients and communicated to them and were doing that even before this program was introduced daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you and so im assuming you did not participate in the ppp program and if thats correct are you aware if any of your clients did participate in that program with other banks james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah let me explain to you how we participated in the program this is a company that is really focused on its target markets our target market sort of middle market companies pennsylvania ohio new jersey new york with revenues between million and million a year these are not small businesses at all so we never bothered to pursue being qualified for sba lending but what we did do is in fact identify parties that we felt were highly professional would respond to our clients and to be candid with you we have clients that we have positioned with other parties for that program that they could participate in and we believe that with the funding its going to be available there probably wont be much more than another dozen that have an interest in it at this time we were able to get everyone for the most part that requested we got them positioned and funded operator the next question is from russell gunther of da davidson please go ahead james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning russell russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good morning hey good morning jim good morning david just follow up on the million of deferrals curious as to how you would expect that number and volume to trend in the second quarter and whether you guys are holding any specific reserves for the deferrals james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc were not holding any specific reserves for the deferral and we believe that it wont have any impact on our second quarter like i said these are folks that we engage with and understand what their particular needs are and their needs at the time were of a cash flow nature they had to essentially close their company down for a period of time until the governor or the president allows them to reopen russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co got it so i guess jim just to make sure i understand youre saying you would not expect to see the million balance or roughly a loans to increase in the second quarter is that correct james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 yeah i would say that if anything itll be very very minimal since we engaged them early on in the program russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co got it okay great now i just want to make sure i understood there and then james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc indiscernible the numbers have we havent placed right now the million russell et gunther q analyst da davidson co okay thank you for that clarification and then my second question would also be a followup on the commercial reserve david you mentioned the basis points and that reserves would likely continue to build from where they are today just curious where you would expect that commercial reserve to end the year and what that contemplates for potential loss rates within those two buckets david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc russell i wish i knew were in very unprecedented times were heading into whats our or were in whats going to be a really tough quarter for the us economy and so well just continue to play it quarter by quarter well be as transparent with you guys as possible just back to your deferral question for a second we reached out to these customers proactively and early because we didnt want them to exhaust all cash reserves before they came to speak with us and so we wanted to understand where they stood and whether they needed to seek deferrals weve completed all those conversations we feel good about where we stand but were going to continue to check in with these people and that might drive more deferrals maybe another million or so and it may drive some reserves at some point so what well do is were going to keep talking to these clients understanding where they stand and well keep you guys informed as that process continues to evolve operator operator instructions the next question is from matt olney of stephens pease go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning guys james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc hey matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey i hopped on the call a few minutes late so you may have covered this in some of your prepared remarks but i wanted to ask about the common equity levels i guess the tangible book value per share was around and that was below the forecast and weve seen this with peers this quarter that implement cecl but will cecl tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 implementation delay a tristate i was surprised to see the lower tangible book value per share any color any kind of unrealized loss or anything that would help explain where tangible book value per share came in this quarter david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc matt id be happy to call you separately we talked about this a few minutes ago and we talked about how we really focus on capital levels at the bank because at the holding company weve got two differentiated businesses the bank and the asset manager and the asset manager really only requires capital for acquisition growth through acquisition and youve got the private bank that does require riskbased capital so capital levels really are focused on our capital levels are really focused on commercial banks and were really focused on tier leverage but id be happy to give you a call afterwards and we can talk further about that matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay yeah lets follow up on that and then i think you also mentioned an expense initiative at chartwell thats been ongoing can you just remind me about this expense initiative where are we on this is there more to come and whats the ultimate goal of probability in that segment thanks james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah to give you a little history on chartwell if you look at we acquired them in march of if you look at our and numbers they contributed on average about to our earnings at that time and i would say for the past couple of years the past three years that was and for and it was more of a highsingle digit number at that point so we had put in place the infrastructure for a much larger asset base and so we made some reductions to general expenses and a few personnel changes there and youre seeing it reflected in the first quarter numbers at this point those changes were made in the third and fourth quarter of last year operator next we have a followup from daniel tamayo of raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks again guys so just kind of shifting over to the balance sheet growth youve had tremendous growth in that private banking group how are you thinking about growth from here kind of through the end of the year or more in the medium term james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah i think we go by the direction on the goals that we had set before that were looking for our loan portfolio in general to grow by to and were certainly in line with that in the first quarter and we expressed to you the demand that we saw in the private banking side so far in the month of april has been pretty meaningful with regard to applications tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc dan you can see that portfolio grow by billion to billion this year again quartertoquarter things could change but thats what it looks like right now daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc and do you have an ultimate percentage of the overall portfolio youd be comfortable letting that segment run to james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc no we dont and what it does is it clearly assists us from a capital standpoint and secondly and most importantly a risk profile theres probably not another bank in the country thats pushing on of the loan portfolio you can count the collateral on a daily basis daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc understood thanks thats all i had james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thanks dan operator next is a followup from steve moss of b riley fbr please go ahead steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc just wanted to tie out total expenses here im not sure if i missed it just wondering what your expense expectations are for the second quarter after theyre well controlled here this quarter david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc steve i would expect the second quarter to probably be very similar to the first dont imagine that were going to get back to normal with a lot of travel and entertainment in the second quarter that obviously those costs were more modest than the first i would remind you that weve got a variable cost structure and so our expenses are likely to stay in line with first quarter expenses as best as we can tell right now steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay thank you very much i appreciate that operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jim getz for closing remarks tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2020 james f getz chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate
