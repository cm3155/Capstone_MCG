management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases first quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please be ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of these results include approximately million of credit reserve builds which ill cover in more detail shortly as well as million of losses and credit adjustments and other in cib regarding loan growth were continuing to see positive trends with loans up yearonyear and quarteron quarter ex ppp with the sequential growth driven by continued pickup in demand in our wholesale businesses including ongoing strength in awm on page we have some more detail on our results revenue of billion was down billion or year on year nii ex markets was up billion or on balance sheet growth and higher rates partially offset by lower nii from ppp loans nir ex markets was down billion or predominantly driven by lower ib fees lower home lending production revenue losses and credit adjustments and other in cib as well as investment securities losses in corporate and markets revenue was down million or against a record first quarter last year expenses of billion were up approximately million or predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses largely offset by lower volume and revenue related expenses credit costs were billion for the quarter we built million in reserves driven by increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in ukraine as well as builds for russiaassociated exposures in cib and awm net charge offs of million were down yearonyear and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our portfolios on to balance sheet and capital on page our cet1 ratio ended at down basis points from the prior quarter as a reminder we exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter the largest being saccr adoption as well as some pickup in seasonal activity in addition to those anticipated items there were a couple of other drivers the rate selloff led to aoci drawdowns in our afs portfolio but keep in mind all else equal these marktomarket losses accrete back to capital through time and as securities mature and price increases across commodities resulted in higher counterparty credit and market risk rwa while of course the environment is uncertain many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror and as a result we believe that our current capital and future earnings profile position us well to continue supporting business growth while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 with that lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was down yearonyear in consumer business banking revenue was up predominantly driven by growth in deposit balances and client investment assets partially offset by deposit margin compression deposits were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter consistent with last quarter and client investment assets were up yearonyear largely driven by flows in addition to market performance in home lending revenue was down yearonyear on lower production revenue from both lower margins and volumes against a very strong quarter last year largely offset by higher net servicing revenue originations of billion declined with the rise in rates and as a result mortgage loans were down moving to card auto revenue was down yearonyear primarily on strong new card account originations leading to higher acquisition costs card outstandings were up and revolving balances have continued to grow ending the quarter above the first quarter of levels and in auto originations were billion down due to the lack of vehicle supply while loans were up touching on consumer spend combined credit and debit spend was up yearonyear with growth stronger in credit as we see a continued pickup in travel and dining and as the quarter progressed we saw a robust reacceleration of te spend up expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by higher investments and structural expenses partially offset by lower volume and revenue related expenses next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion for the first quarter investment banking revenue of billion was down versus the prior year ib fees were down yearon year we maintained our number one rank with a wallet share of in advisory fees were up and it was the best first quarter ever benefiting from the closing of deals announced in debt underwriting fees were down primarily driven by leveraged finance as issuers contended with market volatility and in equity underwriting fees were down on lower issuance activity particularly in north america and emea moving to markets total revenue was billion down against a record first quarter last year fixed income was relatively flat driven by a decline in securitized products where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production largely offset by growth in currencies and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activity in a volatile market equity markets were down against an alltime record quarter last year this quarter however was our second best with robust client activity across both derivatives and cash and prime continued to perform well with client balances hovering around alltime highs credit adjustments other was a loss of million driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustments relating to both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receivables from russia associated counter parties let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this quarter we were hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers who generally sell forward a portion of the coming years production the extreme price movements created margin calls which we and other banks are helping to address because this is counterparty related not trading it appears in the credit adjustments other line where it contributed about million to the reported loss i just mentioned it also drove approximately half of the increase in market risk rwa that i noted on the capital slide and was a driver of higher reported var which will also be elevated in our upcoming filings jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 payments revenue was billion up yearonyear or up excluding net gains on equity investments driven by continued growth in fees deposit balances and higher rates securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher rates and growth in fees expenses of billion were up yearonyear mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments largely offset by lower volume and revenue related expenses moving to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of million and an roe of revenue of billion was flat yearonyear with higher payments revenue and deposit balances offset by lower investment banking revenue gross investment banking revenue of million was down driven by both fewer large deals and less flow activity expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by investments and volume and revenue related expenses deposits were down quarteronquarter as client balances are seasonally highest at year end loans were up yearonyear and up quarteronquarter excluding ppp ci loans were up sequentially ex ppp reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle market and corporate client banking cre loans were up driven by strong loan originations and funding across the portfolio and then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with a pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and performance fees in alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment valuation gains from the prior year expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher volume and revenue related expenses for the quarter net longterm inflows of billion were positive across all channels with strength in equities multiasset and alternatives and in liquidity we saw net outflows of billion aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by strong net inflows and finally loans were up quarteronquarter with continued strength in mortgages and securitiesbased lending while deposits were up turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was a loss of million down million yearonyear nii was up million due to the impact of higher rates and nir was down million due to losses on legacy equity investments versus gains last year as well as approximately million of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter expenses of million were lower by million yearonyear primarily due to the contribution to the firms foundation in the prior year next the outlook on page we still expect nii ex markets to be in excess of billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately billion and well update these and give you more color at investor day next month so to wrap up once again this quarter the companys performance was strong in a particularly volatile and challenging environment we helped our clients navigate very difficult markets provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented complexity with multiple directives from governments jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 around the world and of course our thoughts remain with everyone including our employees affected by russias invasion of ukraine looking ahead the us economy remains robust but were watching high inflation the reversal of qe and rising rates as well as the ongoing effects of the war on the global economy with that operator please open the line for qa question and answer section operator please stand by and our first question is coming from john mcdonald from autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thank you morning jeremy was wondering about the net interest income outlook i know it sounds like well get more at investor day but its very similar to what you gave in midfebruary and obviously rate expectations have advanced since then could you give us a little bit of color and what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex markets outlook jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good morning john good question yeah look obviously given whats happened in terms of fed hike expectations and whats getting priced into the front end of the curve we would actually expect the excess part of in excess of billion to be bigger than it was at a credit suisse so to size that probably a couple billion dollars but we dont want to get too precise at this point we want to run our bottomsup process there have been very big moves and we want to get it right and so well give more detail about that at investor day john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and as my follow up could you give us some thoughts about the marketsrelated nii what things should we think about there whether its seasonality or how its affected by rising rates jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i guess i would direct you to my comments i think one or two quarters ago on this but generally speaking that number is pretty correlated to the shortterm rate so all else equal youll see a headwind in there as the fed hikes come through which in general in the geography we would tend to expect that to be offset in nir but its noisy it can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues as ive mentioned in the past and so thats why we dont focus too much on that number john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks john operator the next question is coming from ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning jeremy just wanted to follow up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic growth with slr cet1 versus your longerterm targets can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential from here and do any of the rwa inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first quarter thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks so let me just give some high level comments about the cet1 trajectory and so on so as you know we went into the quarter with elevated buffers knowing that we would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of saccr and of course if that happened and we would have expected roughly to be at right in the middle of the range for this quarter of course it was an unusual quarter in a number of ways and so we saw rwa inflation from market risk which weve talked about and the aoci drawdown and a number of other slightly smaller factors producing the from where we sit here to your point a number of these items are in fact going to bleed back in relatively quickly some faster than others so we would expect significant portion of the rwa inflation to bleed out obviously to decay out the aoci drawdown will obviously come back over time and probably most importantly to the prior question the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook which will of course accrete to capital so then if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums of course we have the increase in the gsib requirement in the first quarter of coming in and then theres the question of scb where we dont know obviously but given the countercyclical nature of the stress and the fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and the unemployment rate is floored in the feds scenario you might expect scb to be a little bit higher when its published in june effective in the fourth quarter but that gives us time to make any adjustments that we need to make so i guess to summarize when we put all this together between improved income generation some of the denominator decay effects and the various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as new information comes into play we really feel quite good about our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look forward and minimums evolve ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and just a follow up there too is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to help bridge the gap or is it just going to be enough to organically build back with possibly just utilizing less buybacks to allow things to just grow back jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think i guess in general we havent wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions as you know some of these instruments are callable and we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations so i think thats an example of the types of levers that we have available to pull as the environment evolves but from where we sit today with the numbers that im looking at we have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator the next one is coming from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a question for jamie in your annual letter you mentioned how you expect to achieve doubledigit market share over time in payments and what i wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit because when i look at payments youve got a lot of different sleeves for example in consumer credit card youre at in treasury i think youre at so could you give us a sense as to where you think you are in this total payments category youre talking about what youre expecting in terms of drivers to get to doubledigit and what kind of timeframe youre thinking about there thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so betsy that number the doubledigit relating just to wholesale payments not to consumer payments which obviously we already have a fairly significant share and weve gone from to something a little bit north of over the last five years and were just building out and i gave some examples well not give a lot and then you have investor day coming up were building all the things we need realtime payments certain blockchain type things wallets theres a couple acquisitions that are building out our wholesale capabilities to do a far better job for clients globally around the world and supported by what i would say is very good cyber risk controls which clients really need to by the way so its kind of across the board its nothing mystical about it but its an area we want to win in jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and getting to double digits is over the same kind of timeframe the same pace going from to or you think you can accelerate that because i see whats jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i wasnt meaning to put a timeframe on it but i would say five years youll get more update on this at investor day betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just the follow up here is on the nii outlook where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side and is it a couple of billion and i guess the question i have is historically youve been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates you did that last cycle as well what im hearing is that maybe you dont want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at investor day is that a fair take away jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no no no jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co no jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we dont look at it that way like were reinvesting nii the investing stuff we look at all the time were investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board but thats not why hes saying indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think fundamentally we have had confidence in delivering our rotce through the cycle weve talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about at the time some shortterm headwinds to that mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things the investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the the fact that that moment may be getting pulled forward as a result of the feds reaction to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thanks for that operator the next question is coming from steve chubak from wolfe research please go ahead jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to start off with a question on qt in the past youve spoke about the linkage between fed balance sheet reduction and deposit outflow expectation for yourselves and the industry and with the fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path for balance sheet reduction how should we be thinking about deposit outflow risk any views on how betas may differ versus last cycle given a more aggressive pace of fed tightening jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey steve so this is a fun question so lets nerd out a little bit and im sure jamie will jump in jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and then ill indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah exactly okay so look i think weve talked a little about what happened in the prior cycle right so you had qe and then you had big expansion in bank deposits just some wide expansion and then at the tail end of that cycle you had rrp coming in and then rrp has gotten sort of quite big as qe finished and so now as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse you might actually expect that the first thing that would happen is that rrp would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink but i think you correctly point out some of the nuances in the fed minutes and when you sort of combine all the effects together you realize that theres a lot of interacting forces here and its really i think very intelligent people differ on their predictions about whats going to happen here and just to outline a couple of those so its worth noting for starters that in general industrywide loan growth outlook is quite robust and that should be a tailwind for systemwide deposit growth so as you note yeah qt will start in may in all likelihood for the minutes headwind then you just have to look at whats going to happen in the front end of the curve particularly in bills so the treasury has to make decisions about weighted average maturity and what makes sense there theres obviously a little bit of shortage of shortdated collateral in the market right now so that might argue for wanting more supply there the fed has to make decisions about portfolio management they talked in the minutes about using bill maturities to fill in gaps and so on and so forth and so those things are going to interact in various ways jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 i think one thing thats worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain sooner than people might have otherwise thought in all likelihood thats going to be the lower value non operating type deposits so in any case well see but to simplify it for a second our base case remains modest growth and deposits for us as a company and just pivoting away for a second from the system to us from a share perspective weve taken share in retail deposits and we feel great about that and in wholesale weve had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there so thats the current thinking on that topic jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so the answer is we dont know okay and you guys should read economists reports but the fact is initially it probably wont come out of deposits over time it will come out of wholesale and then maybe consumer were prepared for that it doesnt actually mean that much to us in the short run and the beta effectively we dont expect that to be different from what it was in the past so a lot of pluses and minuses you can argue a whole bunch of different ways but the fact it wont be that much different at least the first basis point increase steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats really helpful color thanks for allowing us to nerd out with you guys on that just one more topic or follow up i should say jamie just in the shareholder letter you had spoken about how the market is underestimating the number of fed hikes that might be needed to curb inflation whats your expectation around the level of fed tightening i know its difficult to make such predictions but maybe if you could just help us understand given your own rate outlook how thats informing how youre managing excess liquidity given the significant capacity that you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher yielding securities jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think the implied curve now is like at the end of the year and maybe the end of look no one knows obviously everyone does their forecast i think its going to be more than that okay i could give you a million different reasons why because of inflation and we just talked about deposits and weve never been through ever qt like this so this is a new thing for the world and i think its more substantially important than other people think because of the huge change of flows of funds its going to create as people change their investment portfolios ph so theyre were going to be fine because were going to serve the hell out of our customers and gain share so what does it do for jpmorgan chase jpmorgan chase will be fine ph well play capital play we have great margins we already have the returns we want and all the things like that so i would just be cautious i think we should expect these volatile markets again thats okay for us and the fed we just think the fed needs to do what they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to a soft landing if possible steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and any appetite to deploy the excess liquidity jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 no dont expect that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay we can leave it there steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay thanks so much operator the next question is coming from glenn schorr from evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you i wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions to capture that downside risk in cecl assumptions just because what i want to get to is where we came from where were at now and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter as we go jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i dont want to spend a lot of time on cecl okay i think its a complete waste of time basically all we said is the chance of a adverse or severe adverse event is higher than it was before thats all we did very basic and that led to indiscernible jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co it really is that simple glenn jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and we dont know and its a guess its probability weighted hypothetical multiyear scenarios that we do the best we can but to spend a lot of time on earnings calls about cecl swings is a waste of time its got nothing to do with the underlying business chargeoffs are extraordinarily good as a matter of fact way better than they should be i mean middle market basis points credit card basis points we would have told you in the past that the best theyll ever be is basis points so credits very good ph thatll get worse nii is going to get much better things are going to normalize were still earning or on tangible equity and obviously you have really yeah glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah the is what i wanted because your guess is better than my guess so i appreciate that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 glenn with all due respect i do not believe it is glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay well have a pinky bet so i think you might have just answered but i want to make sure i ask it explicitly the follow up i have on credit and i know its in much better shape and it depends on the go forward but are you seeing any stresses in the levered parts of the debt markets meaning levered loans highyield clo private credit anything in there that makes you turn a side eye jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co just spread widening and a little bit less liquidity glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi that doesnt sound so bad jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no i mean glenn i think look no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff and obviously in this environment everyones looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner but as of right now were really not seeing anything of concern in the kind of spot metrics so to speak glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and theres wage inflation and excess cash are there any buckets the income that youre seeing the earlystage delinquencies picking up jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co in short no it is an interesting question as you look across our customer base particularly in card and sort of the heavily debated question of real income growth and gas prices and whats that doing to consumer balance sheets and so were watching that especially in the kind of lmi segment of our customer base but right now were not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thank you for all that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks glenn operator the next one is coming from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jeremy can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves i think you said it was million that you guys built up and it was due to high inflation and the war in the ukraine how much was it due to inflation and when you made that comment is it because youre concerned about the lower end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that might lead to greater delinquencies down the road and how much was it due to the ukraine situation jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah glenn sic gerard its really a lot more general than that so just to repeat million build million namespecific primarily related to russiaassociated individual names the other million is portfolio level and as jamie just said it simply reflects increasing the probability from a very low probability to a slightly higher probability of a you might call it volcker style fedinduced recession in response to the current inflationary environment which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases which are in part driven by the war in ukraine but its not a super micro portfolio level thing ph except to the extent that our models handle that its a top down modification of the probabilistic weights jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co one of the things i hated when cecl came out is that wed spend a lot of time in every call yapping about cecl i just think its a huge mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc understood and then as a follow up jeremy if we look at the aoci number that you gave us and you were very clear about it its going to creep back into the capital as those securities mature two things is there anything you can do assuming if the long end of the curve continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on aoci as we go forward is there anything you can do to mitigate that whether to shrink that the available for sale portfolio which looks like it was billion at the end of this period or do you just have to grow the revenue as you pointed out and theres another way of growing your capital jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think that obviously we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else i think the large point here is yes there are some things that can be done to mitigate this but the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets us to where we want to be when we need to be there in terms of cet1 and jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 leverage and if things dont play out along the lines of the central case we have tools and levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions so gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator your next one is coming from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i have a question for both jeremy and jamie jeremy i guess the slr close to the minimum you explained that but the since quarter end aoci probably has gotten worse and im guessing your slr might be very even closer to that minimum so i understand your central case its fine your outlook is good but at what point do you say do you stop buybacks or do you think youll buy back maybe half of the billion authorization or does jpmorgan even put on asset caps given just the amazing asset growth over the last three months so thats my question for jeremy the bigger picture is for you jamie your ceo letter the takeaway was in the eyes of the beholder like oh jamie is really worried about a recession this year no hes not so the first question certainly ties into the second so jeremy plan for buybacks stopping at asset caps and then jamie your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay mike so let me take this capital one so first of all lets not talk about asset caps thats just not a meaningful thing i think thats a distraction and the terminology is unhelpful then in terms of the leverage ratio just remember that the denominator of that number is so big that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio so is actually still pretty far away from and of course there are relatively easy to use tools to address that as well as was alluded to earlier in addition i do think its worth just reminding everyone of how the eri restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the crisis just briefly just to remember that based on the redefinition if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone your subject to restriction which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on so its obviously not part of the plan but its just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we had in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no longer there and then in terms of buybacks just a reminder that the billion authorization is a nontime bounded sec requirement its not the old ccar standard so its just a signal that we want to have that capacity and that flexibility but it doesnt really say that much about how much were actually planning to do in the nearterm mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc are you allowed to say what youre planning to do in the nearterm like just like if youre kind of like half the level last year do you think you can keep that or does this slow down or youre not giving guidance ph now jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so lets talk about buybacks for a second in the postscb world we havent been guiding a lot on the pace of buybacks mainly because as you know theyre at the bottom of our capital stack so were focused on investing in the business providing capital to support growing rwa acquisitions when they make sense et cetera et cetera and buybacks are an output as we have discussed in the current environment the rate of buybacks is clearly going to be less than it was in the period as a result of the interaction of all those effects and thats a good thing it means that we have better uses for the capital and if things evolve one way or the other then the rate of buybacks will be an output but its one of the tools in the toolkit jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co mike i would just say mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co if you look at liquidity and capital its extraordinary and we dont want to have buffers on top of buffers so were going to manage this pretty tightly over time and obviously when you have aoci and earnings and cecl all that but youre being conscious of all that we can manage through that and weve done some acquisitions this year and so plus we are adding were planning to have more capital for the increase in gsifi down the road which reduces stock buyback but the amount id look at the amount of liquidity the earnings the capital thats the stuff that really matters and at the end of the day its driving customers we serve customers which is why were here we dont serve managing slr thats kind of an output of stuff we do and so and then your question about i think it was about recession basically yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co do you want to read the question mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah no i mean if you read your ceo letter thats great youre the chief worry officer youre the chief risk manager youre bringing up all the things that keep you up at night which is great but you can read it one way and say hey jamie and jpmorgan thinks theres going to be a recession this year and you can read it another jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 way saying hey things are fine but these are some tail risks so do you think and ill repeat what glenn said your views better than mine and im not going to accept anything else you have a lot people a lot of resources do you think the us is going to have a recession this year based on everything you know jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i dont but i just want to caution this first of all i cant forecast the future any more than anyone else and the feds forecasts it and everyone forecasts it and everyones wrong all the time and i think its a mistake we run the company to serve clients through thick or thin thats what we do we know there are going to be ups we know there are going to be downs we know the weathers going to change and a lot of stuff like that but i have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth right now which will go on its not stoppable the consumer has money they pay down credit card debt confidence isnt high but the fact that they have money theyre spending their money they have trillion still in the savings and checking accounts businesses are in good shape home prices are up credit is extraordinarily good so you have this thats one factor thats going to continue in the second quarter third quarter and after that its hard to predict youve got two other very large countervailing factors which you guys are all completely aware of one is inflationqe qt youve never seen that before im simply pointing out that those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear they may not thats a fact and im quite conscious of that fact and i do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines and stuff like that and the second is war in ukraine i pointed out in my letter that war in ukraine usually wars dont necessarily affect the global economy in the short run but there are exceptions to that this may very well be one of them im not looking at this on a static basis okay so youre looking at this war in ukraine and ph sanctions daily things are unpredictable wars are unpredictable wars have unpredictable outcomes youve already seen in oil markets the oil markets are precarious okay so i pointed that out over and over that if people dont understand that those things can change dramatically for either physical reasons cyber reasons or just supplydemand and so thats another huge cloud on the horizon and were prepared what we understand it were just i cant tell you the outcome of it i hope those things all disappear and go away we have a soft landing and the war is resolved okay i just wouldnt bet on all of that and of course being a risk manager were going to get through all of that were going to serve our clients and were going to gain share were going to come out of that earning tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co youre welcome operator next one is from matthew oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you guys could comment on theres some articles on the nickel exposure and how the losses could have been significant if the trades hadnt been canceled and some of the actions take were taken and just as a follow up you guys have talked about kind of looking at that business and reevaluating just how you think about some of the outsize risks and maybe you could update us on that process jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co weve already told you were helping our clients get through this we had a little bit loss this quarter were going to manage through it well do postmortems on both what we think we did wrong and what the lme could do differently later were not going to do it now matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i guess i mean more broadly speaking given what we just saw where it was probably a several standard deviation event and kind of as you mentioned markets might do more of these unusual things like does it make you step back and look at other portfolios other businesses and try to reduce indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co in my life ive seen so many standard deviation events jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah exactly jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co youd be shocked so obviously were aware of that all the time in everything we do jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and i would take it one step further i think the whole paradigm of saying its a standard deviation event is naïve right we know that returns are not normally distributed we know that regulators know that the capital framework recognizes that in a broad variety of ways including things like stress var so i dont think of course you cant predict where and in which asset class and in which particular moment youre going to see these types of fattail events but the framework recognizes in a range of ways that thats the case and thats how we manage risk and thats how were capitalized jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so we do ccar once a year as you guys see but no we actually run different various stress tests every week with extreme movements in things and thats what we do and youre always going to be a little surprised somewhere but were pretty conscious of those risks and all events like this we always look at but it doesnt happen to us it can happen to someone else we still analyze everything that maybe we were on the wrong side jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 of something too but at the end of the day in all of our businesses were here to serve clients all the time that means taking rational thoughtful disciplined risk to do that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just separately you mentioned earlier that you werent looking to deploy large amounts of your liquidity and i guess the question is you might get the rate benefit just from fed funds going up but is there an opportunity to accelerate that benefit just by moving from cash into shorterterm treasuries weve obviously had a big move in jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co guys were just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than convexity is going up aoci is going up there are all these various reasons not to do that were not going to do it just to give you a little bit more nii next quarter jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and steve sic matt just to go one level deeper there for a second right so you talk about deployment of course as jamie says were always going to take relative value opportunities in the portfolio mortgage spreads have widened theres interesting stuff to do so in that sense yeah deployment out of cash into various sorts of spread product that looks more interesting we do that all the time the highlevel simple question of buying duration as jamie says balance sheets extended a little bit that was never we ph were never planning through that much of that anyway and frankly given the timing and expected speed of the rate hikes increasingly it just kind of doesnt matter that much and yeah so i think that its just helpful to keep that in mind matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question is coming from jim mitchell from seaport global securities please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning maybe you could just talk about how youre thinking about the trajectory of loan growth from here where youre seeing the biggest pockets of strength and specifically to cards is this significant yearover year growth driven more by slowing pay downs or is that increasing demand or a combination of both thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so youll remember in the fourth quarter that we talked about the outlook based on sort of high singledigit loan growth for the year and this quarter weve roughly seen that interestingly its a little bit more driven by wholesale this quarter which sort of brings us to your question of card so overall card loan growth is jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 reasonably robust when you adjust for seasonality and so on and thats really primarily driven by spend which as you know is very robust the question inside of that is then whats going on with revolve and i think our core revolve thesis of getting back to the prepandemic levels of revolving balances by the end of the year is still in place to a good approximation at the margin we probably saw the takeoff moment delayed by six weeks or so because of omicron but some of thats reaccelerating now we see that in some of the march numbers so well see how it goes but also just a reminder that theres a very very close linkage between what we see in revolve and what we see in chargeoffs and so in the moment where revolve is lagging potentially certainly that was true throughout the pandemic period relative to what we had thought we also saw exceptionally lower chargeoffs so on a bottom line basis the run rate performance theres significant offset there but the core thesis is still there spend is robust we are seeing spend down ph with some of the cash buffers in the customer segment that tends to revolve so more or less as anticipated i would say james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay and then maybe just skipping over to trading clearly a stronger quarter must have finished off strongly in march so any confirmation of that and how do we if youre expecting more volatility around fed and qt should we be thinking that this could be a better than normalization year how are you thinking about trading i guess going forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean you know that were going to be reluctant to like predict the next three quarters of trading performance james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities yeah i could try jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah obviously yeah but just to your point about normalization right weve been saying that of course we expect some normalization the question is if you define normalization as a return to kind of like type trading run rate levels we never expected that because theres been a bunch of organic growth in the background some share gains and we had said that as we emerge from the pandemic and monetary policy normalized that was going to add volatility to the markets and that with any luck and good risk management that would netnet help a little bit to mitigate what we might otherwise expect in terms of the drop from the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic so obviously there are some particular things that played out this quarter but one of those was a more volatile rate market and that helps a little bit so yeah all else equal the much more dynamic environment right now would mute the normalization you would see otherwise but our core case is still that the pandemic year period markets performance is not repeatable jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co ill just add to that i cannot foresee any scenario at all where youre not going to have a lot of volatility in markets going forward weve already spoken about the enormous strength of the economy qt inflation war commodity prices theres almost no chance you wont have volatile markets that could be good or of bad for trading but theres almost no chance it wont happen and i think people should be prepared for that james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities all right appreciate the color operator the next one is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess just one more question on the macro outlook i guess we can debate whether or not we get into a recession over the next year but jamie would love to hear your thoughts around as we think about just the medium term do you see a better capex cycle for the us economy weve heard a lot about reshoring labor productivity how companies are dealing with it just given the lens you have in terms of large corporates middle market customers do you see some pentup demand for capex spending thats going to be a big driver of growth maybe not for the next six months but as we think about the medium term next few years jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes in general because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that yes we generally see capex going up and ive got the exact number youre better off looking with our great economists forecast for that than asking me and we see it in the borrowing a little bit jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co now we do see pretty nice loan growth in the commercial bank i mean theres a bunch of different factors there it could be some inventory effects and so on but well see but yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just on that front like have you seen any improvement in supply chains and how big a setback was the russian war to supply chain improvements jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co very hard to tell there was some improvement and then there was ukraine and now its all mixed again so its hard to tell ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q1 earnings call 13apr2022 got it and just one follow up around you launched the uk digital bank last month any early wins in terms of how thats playing out
