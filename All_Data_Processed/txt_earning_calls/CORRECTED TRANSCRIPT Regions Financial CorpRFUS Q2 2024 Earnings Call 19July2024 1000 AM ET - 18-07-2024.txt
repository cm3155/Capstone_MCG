our website these disclosures cover our presentation materials prepared comments and qa i will now turn the call over to john john m turner jr chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today this morning we reported strong second quarter earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of for the second quarter total revenue remained relatively stable at billion on a reported basis and billion on an adjusted basis as net interest income remained resilient and fee revenue declined modestly compared to the first quarter as expected adjusted noninterest expenses declined quarteroverquarter and are expected to remain at this approximate level for the remainder of the year average and ending loans remained relatively stable quarter overquarter reflecting modest customer demand continued focus on clients selectivity and pay downs in the portfolio average deposits also remain relatively stable while ending deposits declined modestly during the quarter consistent with seasonal taxrelated patterns we experienced broadbased improvement in overall asset quality this quarter nonperforming and business services criticized loans as well as net chargeoffs improved sequentially in summary were proud of our second quarter results driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan we have a great plan and the investments were making in talent technology and in products and services are positioning us to benefit as macroeconomic conditions improve our footprint continues to provide us with significant opportunities while we are experiencing more competition in our markets our longstanding presence commitment to communities and the favorable brand we built over many years positions us well as long as we remain focused on execution i have no doubt that we can continue generating topquartile results now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 david j turner jr chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average and ending loans remain relatively stable on a sequential quarter basis within the business portfolio while average loans remained relatively stable ending loans increased despite nearterm macroeconomic and political uncertainty pipelines are beginning to rebuild average consumer loans also remained stable as modest growth in residential mortgage and consumer credit card were offset by declines in home equity and other miscellaneous consumer loans we continue to expect average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to from a deposit standpoint deposits remained relatively stable on an average basis while ending balances declined these declines in the second quarter reflect anticipated tax seasonality having largely returned to prepandemic patterns we expect relative stability in deposits which is typical for summer and early fall as expected deposit remixing has slowed competitive pricing and customer demand for promotional products has stabilized over the second quarter the proportion of noninterestbearing deposits relative to total deposits has remained steady in the low range now lets shift to net interest income net interest income increased modestly during the quarter outperforming our expectations the increase reflects stabilizing deposit trends and asset yield expansion also exceeding expectations the net interest margin declined only basis points resulting primarily from higher average cash levels as expected deposit remixing and cost increases slowed meaningfully in the quarter the full cycle interestbearing deposit beta remained stable at and we continue to expect a mid40 deposit beta will be the peak this cycle asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of fixed rate loans and securities at current higher rate levels this includes the repositioning of approximately billion of securities late in the quarter with an estimated payback period of years relative to the million pretax loss recorded this quarter following our successful million debt issuance in june we used the proceeds to purchase a like amount of securities with a similar duration in order to maintain a relatively neutral balance sheet position and bolster liquidity we believe net interest income has reached an inflection point and is expected to grow over the second half of the year as deposit trends continue to improve and the benefits of fixed rate asset turnover persist as we move further into a stabilizing deposit and funding environment along with securities repositioning and favorable debt issuance levels have pushed our expectation for net interest income towards the upper end of our billion to billion range this narrow range portrays a wellprotected profile under a wide array of possible economic outcomes now lets take a look at fee revenue performance this quarter adjusted noninterest income declined driven primarily by lower capital markets and mortgage income if you recall capital markets experienced seasonally elevated activity in the first quarter as several deals were pushed from the fourth quarter of over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment we expect our capital markets business can consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately million but in the near term we expect it will run around million to million per quarter the decline in mortgage income was primarily driven by positive million adjustment to the companys mortgage pipeline valuation in the first quarter that did not repeat regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 while modestly lower versus the seasonally high first quarter treasury management continues to perform exceptionally well versus the second quarter of last year treasury managements client base has increased while total revenue is up helping to offset this quarters fee income declines wealth management increased to a new quarterly record reflecting increased sales activity and stronger markets based on the strong first half of the year we now expect fullyear adjusted noninterest income to be at the top end of our billion to billion range lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expense decreased compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by lower salaries and benefits occupancy and professional fees the improvement in salaries and benefits was attributable primarily to lower base salaries and seasonally higher hrrelated expenses in the first quarter operational losses also decreased during the quarter and current activity continues to normalize within expected levels we continue to expect fullyear operational losses to be approximately million we remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business we will continue focusing on our largest expense categories which include salaries and benefits occupancy and vendor spend based on results through the first half of the year including outperformance in revenue and our expectation to be towards the top end of our previously provided fullyear revenue ranges we now expect fullyear adjusted noninterest expenses to be between billion and billion regarding asset quality as john indicated overall credit performance improved during the quarter provision expense was essentially equal to net chargeoffs at million and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio remained relatively stable at we expect fullyear net chargeoffs to be towards upper end of our basispoint to 50basispoint range attributable to a few large credits within our higher risk portfolios however those losses are fully reserved for assuming stable loan balances and a relatively stable economic outlook we expect our acl ratio to remain flat to declining over the second half of the year lets turn to capital and liquidity we ended the quarter with an estimated common equity tier ratio of while executing million in share repurchases and million in common dividends during the quarter earlier this week the board of directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of per share a increase over the second quarter this increase is in addition to the increase last year representing three consecutive years of robust dividend growth well supported by underlying financial performance additionally we received notification of our supervisory capital stress test results including the preliminary stress capital buffer which will remain at for the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of we expect to maintain our common equity tier ratio consistent with current levels over the near term this level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet proposed regulatory changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase shares commensurate with earnings with that well move to the qa portion of the call regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting our questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys maybe just walk through some of the key drivers of the updated nii guidance you know youre expecting some nice growth in the second half and given that the fed cuts wont be a material driver maybe just talk a little bit about the magnitude of the growth that youre expecting and can you maintain that pace beyond the second half and what does all this mean for where you think the margin can head over the medium term david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so as we had mentioned last quarter were neutral to short term rates and so the benefit that we see for this quarter and then going forward is how we controlled our deposit costs so our interestbearing costs were up basis points so the front book back book benefit that were getting is when you add securities and loans about call it basis points is now overwhelming the change in deposit costs and we expect that to continue for the rest of the year so we dont really need any cuts to help that if we get them we get them but were neutral to that so we think the driver really going forward in addition to what i just mentioned will be balance sheet growth and so we think that can help us continue to grow nii and when you look at all that we felt comfortable saying wed be at the upper end of our range we also did a repositioning trade and thatll help us march towards the upper end as well so we think were in pretty good shape we get a little bit of loan growth in the back half of the year it sets us up nicely for ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe as a followup on the expenses the increase in expenses being somewhat commensurate with the increase in revenue so can you maybe just parse out how much of the increase in expenses was driven by better revenues and is there maybe a pull forward of some expenses from next year in order to position you for improved positive operating leverage david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp really the increase is attributable to the expected increase in revenue both nii and nir that you mentioned our expectations for that for the year being at the upper end of our ranges thats the primary driver also impacting regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 the full year we have about million in expenses associated with market value adjustments on hr assets and so that is what it is well see if that reverses or not and to a lesser extent we experienced some modest incremental increases in the first half of the year and the opportunities to offset that arent likely so its important when you consider all this our revenue and expense that we are firmly committed to generating positive operating leverage over the back half of ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everyone hey thanks for taking the question i was hoping maybe at the top level you could please speak to kind of the competitive backdrop for commercial lending i mean it seems like its tough everywhere but it seems like everyone appropriately wants to be in the southeast so maybe just the overall competitive landscape and then maybe if you could also please highlight just sort of in your own words or thoughts what it would take to generate better commercial loan demand at this point john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah so it is competitive youre right were in great markets we talk about that a lot and as a result of that were seeing more and more competition we think were competing well we believe our business is largely about the quality of our people the execution of our plan providing unique ideas and solutions to customers those things differentiate us and fundamentally in our business we think it is about talent we continue to recruit across our markets and are having some good success doing that as a result were seeing nice growth in our commercial middle market business offset by declines in some of our specialized industries groups and in investor real estate as you might imagine as those portfolios pay down but all in all activity is still somewhat muted customers remain cautious given some concern about inflation cost the political environment just general uncertainty but activity is improving pipelines are stronger than they were a year ago certainly stronger they were two quarters ago and so while were not projecting much loan growth for this year we do believe that there is and we would expect in i think to likely see economic activity pick up reflected by the increase in activity in our pipelines so yes its competitive we think were competing effectively largely because of the quality of the teams that we continue to build and the longterm relationships that we enjoy and well continue to focus on that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 okay perfect thank you and then david just a quick one for you youve done a couple of these incremental balance sheet repositionings which would have been great especially as theyve helped to sort of push up the nii expectation through the year i think you speak in the deck to opportunities for further ones maybe if you could just sort of help put a frame of reference would we look at similar sort of iterative ones like this what would be the size of the opportunities et cetera david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i think so we continue to look for opportunities like this that its a good use of capital weve got our capital ratio kind of where we need it to be so to the extent we can use our capital accretion through earnings for something like this it would be good to do and this is about the size this is probably the biggest you would see from us its in that range of earnings so we like to take opportunities to do this when our payback period is fairly tight we like three years and in this one the first one was year payback period this one was years and so if we could get an opportunity to do something in that three and then we might do that we may take advantage of that the curve continues to steepen that really gives us an opportunity to take advantage of it as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you guys for taking the questions john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning everyone question on the deposit side just i think the plus basis points on the interest bearing cost was probably a lot better a lot lower than people thought just wondering if you can kind of talk us through what youre seeing underneath there in terms of whether youre continuing to see some backfill catch up or and whether youre starting to see the ability to kind of change price and how you kind of build that into that forward expectation thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so our cumulative beta is we said wed be in the middle so call it to we feel confident in that because we understand our customer base theyre still with some remixing going on and because the industry doesnt have a lot of loan growth the demand or the aggressive competition for deposits just regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 has not been there we have to be competitive with our deposit rates and we think we are weve been very short on things like cds to take advantage of when we think rates may actually go the other way so we have a lot of confidence though that it may tick up deposit costs may tick up depending on how the mix shift happens continuing to grow core checking accounts and operating accounts those are really important to us and as a result i dont think youre seeing a major change in our deposit cost and therefore our cumulative beta in that range i think is important ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay cool great and then just a followup on just credit great to see the npas come down and also understanding your point that the two couple credits are fully reserved for can you just flush out your just general points on just how asset quality feels what youre just seeing in underlying migration and any things that youre still just kind of watching out underneath the surface for the most thanks john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp sure yeah so weve indicated i guess for a couple of quarters that we thought our credit metrics would likely peak in the second quarter and i think thats proven to be true weve highlighted a couple of industries that weve been concerned about now for again a couple of quarters thats obviously of our asset classes office senior housing transportation manufacturing of commercial nondurables information are areas that we are following that the particular portfolios where we think theres been some systemic impacts specifically office transportation senior housing senior housing seems to be improving transportation still in a recession particularly for those smaller transportation companies that are operating in the spot market but that may be improving modestly as well office were still working through really creditbycredit and we talked about office we have credits and about of those are they are single tenant so were really working on about to relationships that are multitenant we think we have a good handle on that exposure and are continuing to work through it with respect to our guidance our nonperforming loans are centered in credits that represent about of our total nonperforming loans five of those are office related and in every case were working with the customer in some instances were adding additional collateral to support the credit we may be getting some additional tenant improvement money weve got i think a pretty good approach to resolving the credits we know we believe we are wellreserved just as a point weve been asked about our allowance allowance against our multitenant book is about total allowance against our office book so we feel like were adequately reserved against the portfolio and we just have to continue to work through them so our guide is chargeoffs toward the upper end of a 40basis point to 50basispoint range that reflects the fact that we do have some large exposures the issue is we cant predict the timing and so well expect these things will get resolved over the next two quarters they may or they may not but we continue to work on it otherwise the level of downgrades and upgrades is sort of coming into equilibrium which indicates again that we think weve reached a point of some stabilization in our credit metrics should potentially see them go a little higher go a little lower they will ebb and flow but we think weve reached a point of stability regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 operator does that complete your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah it does thanks very much john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning following up on kens questions on deposits youre telling us and youve always had a good view of and know your consumer especially very well im wondering as we start to take these rate cuts how we should expect sort of deposit balances to be hit and then what the betas could look like and david if you could sort of break it down in terms of how you expect the betas in the indiscernible commercial versus betas for consumer and also to indiscernible could be helpful as well david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah erika you broke up a little there but i think its kind of what do we think betas will look like as rates come down so we do have a schedule in our investor deck its a good one for everybody to look at its on page and so we really have three buckets of deposits if you will with different beta assumptions in all three of these buckets so in general we expect a mid30 down rate beta and so if you think about about of those accounts reprice with the market so theyre tied to an index or they are shortterm cds so we kept our tenors fairly short call it five months so that as rates came down we would have a chance to reprice that and then the beta for those is somewhere between and if you go to the other end of the spectrum we had about of our deposit base that was low beta low cost never moved up probably not going to move down and so that beta is going to be very low because it never actually increased and then we have about thats kind of in the middle that we think is call it to beta and so we structured our deposit book to really take advantage of rates as they come down but were only factoring in even though on uprates we had beta as i mentioned earlier weve only factored in our guidance to have at a down rate it could be better than that but the comes from that math that i just walked you through which again is on page of our investor deck erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and its been a while since weve had sort of had a level where we stopped at when there has been an easing cycle thats above zero and historically as we and im sure everybodys thinking about this regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 indiscernible through net interest income historically where do you price relative to fed funds do you price it if fed funds ends up being at where youre usually of that in terms of where your deposit costs settle out is it better is it worse just trying to think about obviously theres a lot of uncertainty as to what the ultimate rate path is going to be but obviously we need help because we havent had an easing cycle that didnt end at zero for some time david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i think you got to think of it a little more globally in terms of kind of fed funds and where do you think terminal fed funds are going to be to thats kind of our best guess when we get there who knows and in that with a normal yield curve where fed funds are to our balance sheets structured to have a margin thats going to be in the range maybe and so thats our expectation we think as rates start to get cut from here and we have a normalizing or less inverted yield curve that our margin can pick up we said wed exit at and we should start to climb as our net interest margin should start to increase a bit as we go through and beyond but the kind of steady state for us would be to with the fed funds its to erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp good morning hey ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe david just looking at the slide with the historical sort of net chargeoffs is it fair to conclude that absent a recession basis points of charge offs should be set as the high end in the nonrecessionary environment i understand any given quarter can move around but generally is there any reason why charge offs could be elevated even in a nonrecession going forward than what weve seen i guess over the last years or years john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah i mean we dont believe so ebrahim we have had a little change in the composition of our loan portfolio since the precovid timeframe we acquired ascentium capital weve acquired enerbank we believe we have regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 a good handle on what those relative charge offs or the contribution to charge offs will be but were observing that obviously as we operate those companies we have grown our presence in the corporate banking space as weve talked about before we are taking some larger exposures thats intentional helps us as we think about growing our capital markets business being more important to customers and so from timetotime as you acknowledge we could have a large chargeoff that would impact the numbers but generally we believe based on all our observations that the 40basispoint to basispoint range is historically appropriate and where we should operate over time certainly nonperforming loans somewhere between basis points and basis points is a reasonable range with may be a little lower from time to time i wouldnt expect us frankly to be much higher but thats kind of our view of what our credit metrics will look like given the composition of the portfolios that we currently have ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats good color john thank you and i guess i think i heard you say in your prepared remarks the pipelines lending pipelines are beginning to pick up give us a sense like do we need rate cuts for the pipelines to begin to translate or do we need to get through the elections in order to get things going like what would be the driver to get customers off the sidelines start borrowing and also give us a sense of just from a ph often standpoint where is the bank hiring obviously theres a lot going on across your markets competitively yeah where are we investing in terms of branches or hiring of bankers et cetera that would be helpful john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah so maybe ill work backwards were investing in markets like atlanta nashville houston dallas orlando tampa where we either have had a significant presence over time and see an opportunity grow or have made investment like in houston and so the first three or four markets weve been there for some time we have a strong presence were continuing to build on that markets like houston and dallas were making investments to grow and see real opportunity there with respect to your question about pipelines i think im trying to remember the question now i see somebody help me ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah yeah well what would be the catalyst for like when you talk to speak to your customers pipelines and building is it rate cuts is it john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah thank you yeah thank you im sorry yeah so i think eliminating uncertainty but cost is the bigger issue i spent some time this week talking to one of our customers whos a large supplier of construction materials and he indicated that theyre getting a lot of requests for bids theyre completing a lot of bids but theyre not seeing a lot of work awarded and i think thats consistent with the fact that costs are still high whether it be interest cost labor costs cost of materials and it is costs that make things somewhat uneconomic or create more risk than customers are comfortable with and so i think we need just continue to see adjustments in pricing at the same time i expect that our customers will continue to adjust their operations to accommodate changes in pricing i think thats the bigger factor the regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 election probably has some impact on just uncertainty overall as do the broader geopolitical events that are occurring but i believe its probably more likely interest rates and cost will be the catalyst as those things come down for more economic activity ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful john thank you operator our next question comes from line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc morning just on the expenses the guidance is kind of towards the upper end of the range is that just because the fees are coming in higher or anything else in terms of like increased investment spend to top that off as well david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah as i mentioned earlier the increase is largely attributable to the expected increase in revenue both from a net interest income and noninterest revenue standpoint and we also had million in expenses associated with the market value adjustments on hr related assets that was a piece and to a lesser extent weve experienced some modest incremental increases in the first half of the year and opportunities to offset that just arent likely however as i mentioned earlier we are committed to generating positive operating leverage in the second half of this year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then as you look out a little bit longer term like im not trying to pin you down but just call it like the medium term the next couple of years like what do you think is a good underlying expense growth as we think about some of the positives you mentioned before like loan growth picking up maybe the higher capital markets run rate what would you think is a reasonable level thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp you didnt want to push down to but you added on there indiscernible david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp every year we go through a challenging discussion as to what we think expenses are ought to be for budget and going forward if you look we do have a slide in our investor deck that shows that our compound annual growth regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 rate since about is little over we try to keep it to if we can weve had some labor inflation as everybody has over the last couple of years and obviously technology costs continue to go up so i would expect us to be somewhere matt in that to range and not committing to that just yet well give you the guidance for in january but that should give you at least a start matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thats helpful and makes sense thank you operator our next question comes from line of chris spahr with wells fargo please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp hey chris david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning so this is just a followup i think to ebrahims question so youve had a good youre on pace to have a good midsingle digit or growth i think in core fees this year what do you think regions can achieve over the next two years to three years with all the tactical hires youve kind of made and when they just start monetizing and if fees are about of revenues what do you think that could be in three years to five years david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well we continue to look for ways to generate fees by offering products and services that our customers value and need and so youve seen us do several acquisitions to that end were trying to stay committed to generating positive operating leverage between growth and nii and nir and controlling our expense base so i think well continue to do that and expect to generate positive operating leverage in well give you a finer point on that again in january but if we could have a little higher percentage of our fees weve always said we would like to have revenue between nii and nir weve been saying that for long time and been able to get there but if were going to increase that call it of our revenue in fees thatll be great weve overcome an awful lot of consumer fee declines whether it be interchange through durbin od fees and the like and weve made investments in other products and services that have helped us including treasury management investments that weve made where weve been up call it to three years running now so wealth management continues to grow they had a great quarter this quarter hit a record as a matter of fact regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 so were going to continue to look for ways to generate fee growth that offset some we have some potential impacts if durbin gets updated weve given you that information so i think its incumbent upon us to continue to look for ways to continue to grow christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then regarding capital on slide just do you have any kind of target or aspirational target that you have for cet1 allin if its at quarter end david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so we have a capital range of operating range of to on cet1 weve increased that to point this quarter the reason for that was partly uncertainty with the economy and then uncertainty with regards to basel iii and what that was going to mean to us we have seen the draft of b3 as has everybody and we think were within striking distance of whatever the ultimate basel iii is going to be and so we dont need to let our capital continue to accrete higher from here and as a result if we generate income well continue to pay a fair dividend well continue to look for ways to reposition our securities portfolio if that makes sense and if all else doesnt work then well buy our stock back and weve done all three of those things this past and of course we use that to grow loans as well and you should look for us to continue that and so the capital of cet1 of is about where you should expect it to be going forward thats until we ultimately get basel iii christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay but so that implies you were kind of there was a decline in your buybacks in the second quarter so we should expect a meaningful increase in the third and fourth quarter david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well commensurate with earnings and if we the reason that we had changed we used a bit of that capital for the million pretax loss we took on the securities repositioning so its all predicated on how big if any of our capital generation will we use for that the buyback is nothing more than what it takes to solve for getting us to common equity tier christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc right thank you john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi john hi david john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john you and i have talked in the past about pipelines and you emphasized that they are stronger today than they have been recently and i know its hard to quantify this but can you give us any kind of subjective opinion that these pipelines the pull through could be even better than in the past or any color there john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp i dont have an opinion gerard that would be different than our historical experience i do think that we are seeing as i said pipelines build we have seen some softness in some of our specialized businesses and those pipelines in particular are beginning to improve particularly in areas like energy as an example financial services where we also include our subscription lines in our that would be comprised of our insurance book of some of the businesses where were lending to customers who actually lend to others weve got some strong relationships in consumer finance that have been really good over time but i cant tell you that i believe necessarily that were going to see any change in pull through rates gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and i know david youve given us very good detail on the cet1 and uses of capital for buybacks or the securities repositioning possibly john or david or both of you can you give us your views on acquisitions i know you over the recent past have done nondepository acquisitions of course but when you look out over the next two or three years theres likely to be more banking consolidation how do you kind of look at that outlook for regions john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah gerard thank you we have said historically that weve not been interested in depository acquisition weve obviously made a number of nonbank acquisitions that have added to our capabilities helped us grow and diversify revenue and we continue to look for those we believe that we have a really solid plan if we execute our plan then we can generate top quartile returns for our shareholders without doing any bank ma its disruptive its challenging we certainly have over time through our performance improved our positioning our currency is much stronger than it was years years ago but we still dont think that bank acquisition necessarily is in our future its not part of our strategy today as i said its disruptive its complicated and frankly if we just execute our plan we think we can deliver great results for our shareholders thats not to say we wont follow whats going on well pay attention and we will continue to observe the market but today were focused on executing our plans regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you john operator our next question comes from line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp hey john david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to credit your acl ratio came down slightly this quarter by about a bit and just given what youre seeing on the credit front given your commentary that your trends are peaking around this quarter on certain fronts where do you see the reserve ratio going from here can you kind of walk through the expectations if you could see incremental release on that front thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah john so as we stated if you look at our credit metrics theyre improving weve said our chargeoffs would be at the upper end of our range and so those are our reserve for so the expectation would be absent loan growth or changes in economic conditions as those chargeoffs come through you would expect the acl to come down where it comes down ultimately which is what i think your question is is hard to tell we have to look at it every quarter and take all the information thats available to come up with the reserve something that you can look at just as a guide is if you were to go to prepandemic or prececl which was the fourth quarter of and in that scenario credit was kind of looking pretty good but there was a little bit of a forecast a downturn in economy at that time and our absolute cecl reserve was if you take the losses though at that time by portfolio and apply it to our current portfolio that would equate to a reserve level of i think we put that on the bottom of one of our charts and so you would expect over time to bleed back down towards something more normal like that how fast that gets there when it can get there thats impossible for us to tell but generally speaking what we know today is that if we have chargeoffs coming through in the short term you should see the acl come down john pancari q analyst evercore isi regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 yeah thank you for that i know you expected it flat to down but just helping frame it like that is its definitely helpful and then secondly on the expense front as a followup to matts question i know youre confident in the positive operating leverage in the back half of this year and it sounds like youre focusing on positive operating leverage for next year as well your longterm expense growth rate that you alluded to in your response of to thats a bit above where it looks like consensus is running right now around for next year i guess where are you investing in areas that could put you in that to range versus anywhere lower and maybe if you could talk about what that would mean for a longer term efficiency ratio that you should be running at david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so were going to give you more pointed guidance for later so were not trying to get ahead of ourselves generally speaking inflation thats baked into our book is going to be close to that our largest category of expense for salaries and benefits and so we have to adequately pay our people and we are also investing in technology cyber consumer compliance all those things take a lot of money to continue to invest in them to improve in all those areas we have to find ways to pay for that and thats what gets harder as we the lowhanging fruit is not there weve done a really good job of controlling our expense base we have one of the lowest efficiency ratios in the peer group we were hoping to get to the lower over time we think we can do that but were going to have to leverage technology better overtime than we do today and i think thats going to be true for anybody in the industry and so by doing that you have less reliance on labor and so you can let natural attrition take care of labor as you implement technology solutions so were spending call it to of our revenue on technology we have some big technology projects in the works with our new deposit system new commercial loan system new general ledger those take money we got to figure out how to pay for that and keep our expense run rate as low as we can so our goal is to try to continue to move our efficiency ratio down from where we are today to get to that lower john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it no thats helpful and since you mentioned the deposit system is that still running on plan david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp its a big project and its moving according to how we have it laid out but weve got a long way to go so were not there yet john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yes its running on plan john john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right all right thank you both of you i appreciate it regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp okay operator our next question comes from line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just want to make sure i heard you right on the nim normalized nim in normalized rate environment so if i heard you correctly it was normalized rate environment starts with the fed funds thats somewhat similar to inflation right like and you have a steep curve from there or a steep normal curve not inverted and in that environment on a fullyear basis youre saying that your normalized nim should be somewhere in the to range is that right david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thats right you got it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and that based on the forward curve that would be again sometime in or david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then obviously thats higher than your nim that you had this quarter could you just walk and i know you spend a lot of time on the nii and the nim in the beginning part of the call i just want to make sure i understand the key drivers that take you from where your nim is today to that normalized thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah well i think as rates continue to come down our funding cost our input costs will come down as well and the power of our front book back book will continue to benefit us for a couple of years so with the curve regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2024 steepening and a repricing of the balance sheet thats what drives you up from where you are in the to that range that we just talked about its just about what period of time we think we have our beta down coming down rate beta in the mid we think is appropriate perhaps conservative and so its an important driver to get the input cost down and to continue to grow balance sheet to grow we have some high yielding assets that have higher losses but they have nice returns nice net interest margins continuing to grow checking accounts of a consumer and operating accounts of a business are huge drivers to lowering the input cost on deposits and so thats why its so important for us to continue to make investments in the markets as john mentioned earlier for both of those reasons and the consumer side and business side to get those checking accounts and operating accounts betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so should i do i read it as you are liability sensitive or do i read it as you are neutral with these changes that drive the nim higher or youre asset sensitive but decliningly so as rates fall david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp were neutral to the short rates and so to the extent we start seeing rate cuts then youre going to see our deposit costs continuing to come down and we still have fixed rate assets that will continue to help benefit nii and the margin and will happen as the curve will steepen so you keep if you stay anchored on the long end and short rate comes down and well benefit from that as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc super thank you thats very clear appreciate it operator thank you i would now like to turn the call back over to john turner for closing comments john m turner jr chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp okay well thank you all very much
