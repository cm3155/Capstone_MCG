management discussion section operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by welcome to columbia banking systems first quarter earnings update at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session instructions will be given at that time operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to your host clint stein president and chief executive officer of columbia banking system clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you michelle welcome and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on todays call as we review our first quarter results which we released before the market opened this morning the earnings release and accompanying investor presentation are available at columbiabankcom during our past few earnings calls ive commented on our bankers remaining externally focused despite the pandemic they continued to show up in person and operate within the confines of a postcovid world their determination allowed us to attract new clients and deepen existing relationships the momentum that was building at the end of last year accelerated in the first quarter which is typically our seasonal weakest columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 the core team dedicated to round two of the paycheck protection program was extremely efficient which limited the time our bankers were not able to dedicate their full attention to supporting our clients as a result excluding ppp we achieved the first quarter record for new loan originations we had another quarter of impressive deposit inflows and our financial services group revenues were a new quarterly high surpassing the old record set just last quarter our performance is the outcome of a very deliberate strategy and focused on continuing to build our business throughout the pandemic while at the same time ensuring the safety of our employees and clients we activated our well tested pandemic response plan early which gave our teams more time to shift resources in response to changing state mandates and new federal stimulus programs at the same time we continue to support all of our clients ensuring that their immediate needs were met and longer term plans could move forward the benefits of this strategy are evident in our loan production and deposit growth as well as in the strength of our loan pipeline i could not be more proud of every one of our employees as a team we expanded relationships with clients and each other and improved our operating leverage while meeting the challenges of a very unique economy on the call with me today are aaron deer our chief financial officer chris merrywell our chief operating officer and andy mcdonald our chief credit officer following our prepared remarks well open the line and take your questions i need to remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release our website or our sec filings at this time ill turn the call over to aaron aaron james deer analyst columbia banking system inc thanks clint and good morning everyone during the quarter columbia generated net income of million or per share pretax preprovision income up million was down million from the fourth quarter of primarily due to lower net interest income stemming from a combination of lower asset yields less income from interest recoveries and security prepayments compared to the first quarter of pretax preprovision income was million due to reduced funding costs stronger mortgage banking activity and lower expenses total deposits end of the quarter billion which was an increase of million from yearend the inflows were largely in noninterestbearing accounts and were spread throughout our footprint the increase is attributed to federal stimulus including round two of ppp as well as new relationships and tempered spending and investment by our clients our cost deposit dropped basis point linked quarter to basis points matching our all time low total loans end of the quarter billion which was an increase of million from yearend first quarter loan production was million including round two ppp production of million loan balances excluding ppp loans increased slightly to billion new loan production excluding ppp was brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which compares to the overall portfolio also excluding ppp of the net interest margin of was down basis points on a linked quarter basis there were a number of factors behind the drop but the most impactful was lower coupon rates on loans which contributed basis points to the decline much of the remaining drops columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 stem from less interest income and the early repayment of certain cmbs and a large interest recovery on a non accrual loan in the prior quarter which together contributed about basis points of pressure noninterest income was down slightly in a linked quarter basis to million or this was up million from the first quarter of the modest linked quarter decline was mostly due to seasonally lower mortgage banking income but we were actually pleased with how well mortgage volumes held up noninterest expense of million was down just slightly when compared both on a linked quarter and prior year basis notably our compensation expense in the first quarter benefited from the favorable impact of capitalized origination costs for round two of ppp loans this benefited the quarter by million that was partly offset by of data processing costs for round two originations in addition we recorded a million provision for unfunded commitments if we look for our quarterly expense run rates return to a mid to upper run rate for the remainder of the year provision for income taxes decreased million on a linked quarter basis to million representing a effective rate we expect our tax rate to be in the range of to and with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone weve worked hard partnering with our clients to help them and their businesses remain viable and healthy over the past year this has resulted in deeper relationships and upward momentum which is evident in the tremendous deposit flows and strong loan production in what is typically our seasonal low quarter while round two ppp loan production has been a major focus we have also emphasized business as usual and this approach has allowed us to win new business during a tough year and to create new opportunities as communities begin to exit the economic crisis as clint noted excluding round two ppp loans we achieved a new first quarter loan production record of million this was the sixth highest production quarter ever and follows the quarterly record of million set during the fourth quarter of last year loan production was offset by a decline in utilization of during the quarter and in the past year which was a headwind of million and million respectively the decrease is partly due to typical seasonal agricultural pay downs a shift in funding from existing lines to ppp loans as well as delayed investment from uncertainty within the economy nonetheless we continue to be pleased with the momentum of loan production and are optimistic with the healthy pipeline that is expected to generate quality loan production in the months to come as of march our round two ppp loan productions supported over clients and we received more applications in this round than we did in round one where we funded all qualified loan applications we are proud to support our communities by providing critical funding in support of both existing and new clients excluding ppp quarterly production next was fixed floating and variable overall the portfolio mix is now ppp loans nonppp fixed floating and variable the composition of the loans in the first quarter benefited from the favorable impact of our conversation to start portfolio remain relatively unchanged with a small increase in ci due to additional round two ppp loans columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 gross of unearned income ppp loans were million at the end of the first quarter since we opened the forgiveness portal in midaugust we have received over million of payoffs and pay downs all related to round one of the program deposits grew by million in the quarter and at an unprecedented or billion over the past months to billion as of march the deposit mix remained at business and consumer over half of the increase during the quarter was in demand deposits and as of march 31st the deposit base was evenly split between noninterest bearing and interest bearing we continue to drive exception rates down and as was mentioned our cost of deposits declined to an industry leading basis points fee activity remained robust in the quarter with financial services and trust revenue at a new high up over first quarter and although residential mortgage activity slowed on a linked quarter basis it drove loan revenue up by or million when compared to the prior year quarter this offset declines in deposit account fees from the increased liquidity on customer balance sheets at the end of march we announced the move of our tigard oregon branch to a new financial hub location just like our ballad and boise neighborhubs the tigard financial hub will offer the same banking experience geared towards helping our clients achieve their comprehensive financial goals including investments trust services and other financial considerations the tigard financial hub is scheduled to open in july now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you chris this quarters acl totaled million a reduction of almost from yearend net chargeoffs of only led for the provision less than the provision release for the quarter our forecast assumes annual gross domestic product to increase to for with the unemployment rate predicted in at an improvement from the last quarter as noted before we use ihs markit for our economic forecasts the improved forecast is counterbalanced by continued strength in the travel and leisure industries which are showing signs of stabilizing as i noted previously we continue to apply and overlay this quarter for what we consider high risk commercial real estate and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a significant northwest employer these amounted to a combined million in q1 an increase from million in q4 our adjustment is driven by the continuing impact of the pandemic affecting hospitality shifting dynamics in office and retail and business closures and capacity restrictions in the restaurant industry we ended the quarter with an allowance relative to period end loans of adjusting for the ppp loans the allowance to period end loans increases to npas for the quarter were relatively unchanged basis points however i always like to adjust for ppp loans as i believe it provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward with this adjustment npas did not increase much only basis point to basis points active loans for the quarter basis points compared to basis points last quarter net chargeoffs as noted earlier were essentially nil versus basis points last quarter and our impaired capital ratio was problem loans which we define as loans rated watch or worse declined from million last quarter to million as of march we did see migration downward from watch and special mention to substandard during the columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 quarter which also impacted our allowance for credit losses aviation hospitality and restaurants were categories where we saw the negative migration okay deferrals at the close of the quarter we had million in active deferrals or less than of our portfolio excluding ppp loans this is down from the million in deferrals at the end of last year deferrals for the most part continue to run off as expected we continue to classify our retail hospitality restaurant and aviation portfolios as portfolios subject to an elevated level of risk due to the pandemic in aggregate these portfolios account for about billion or of our loan portfolio as alluded to for the past two quarters we have removed our dental and healthcare portfolios from this classification both of these portfolios exhibited stable metrics throughout problem loans remained very modest in this segment there were no past dues in either portfolio and deferrals were less than million or less than basis points on a combined portfolio of billion as at quarter end okay so for those that we still classify retail is the largest segment at million in loans outstanding at the end of the quarter while we remain concerned over the pandemic impact on this portfolio problem loans are actually down yearoveryear we had no past dues in this segment nonaccruals are only basis points and no retail loans were on deferral as of march 31st ppp loans have certainly made a difference for our borrowers in this portfolio while these statistics are all positive we continue to be cautious however given the colloquial evidence we see in our footprint hospitality at million has shown a mixed bag of results in total problem loans in the segment declined during the quarter and now represent about of the portfolio down from however we did see substandard assets increase to of the portfolio from at year end there is clearly a bifurcation in the portfolio between those which are leisure oriented and those which are business oriented leisure properties have weathered the pandemic much better than our original expectations while business oriented properties continue to struggle leisure travel accounts for about of our portfolio while business accounts for restaurants which account for about million saw a modest amount of negative migration during the quarter problem loans increased from to and criticized classified assets increased from million to million we had about million in deferrals in this portfolio at quarter end similar to the retail businesses ppp loans have had a meaningful impact for restaurant operators as of march 31st of our restaurant operators were at occupancy however with rollbacks put in place by governors in both oregon and washington that has dropped to as of today that demonstrating the fickle nature of this pandemic and the economic recovery as we move forward for this industry however with the summer months arriving outdoor dining will be returning to our footprint this combined with an increasing number of people becoming vaccinated all bode well for the restaurant industry indiscernible finally the aviation portfolio at roughly million down by about million from a year ago was relatively stable during the quarter as in past quarters no long past dues all customers continue to pay as agreed and no loans were on deferral almost all the news in this area has been positive with some airlines projecting to be cash flow positive by the end of this quarter with that ill turn the call back over to clint columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you andy as noted in our proxy statement columbia banks commitment to social responsibility is in full alignment with our corporate values to learn more about our efforts in this area we invite you to visit our new esg page found in the investor section of our website there youll find information supporting our commitment to sound environmental social and corporate governance principles a regular quarterly dividend of was announced this morning this quarterly dividend will be paid on may to shareholders of record as of the close of business on may this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now michelle well open the call for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co question on the margin ph my date myself here on the clint i recall back in the day sort of you pegged a now the bank was probably half the size and different interest rate environment but i guess longer term weve got quite a bit of liquidity but is that a tangible mark over time to climb back to just trying to kind of longer term peg a margin thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i mean theres a lot of different ways that we could respond to that and youre right jeff youve been with us for a long period of time and throughout the history of our company and in the different rate environments and business cycles that has been the range that weve kind of gravitated towards but cash the liquidity thats come onto our balance sheet the past year thats really i think a lot of whats driving the compression what i guess if im in your shoes i have to think about what do i assume in terms of that liquidity being absorbed with loan demand the yield curve steepening the fed meeting this week and this inflation continue to pressures continue to mount yeah so theres a lot of variables there columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 and thats why weve really been focused on growing net interest income because we think that thats something that our direct efforts the production that chris has talked about in his prepared remarks and some of the things that aaron and his team have done in terms of deploying that excess liquidity i think as the business environment normalizes and the rate environment starts to look something like what we what weve seen prepandemic and say over the past prior seven or eight years our bankers are doing a lot of great things and so i think that well work through that liquidity and the loanto deposit ratio will come up and i think youll start to see some margins behave in a manner thats consistent with maybe what youve seen in prior cycles i dont know if aaron has anything to add aaron james deer a analyst columbia banking system inc yeah i mean i guess i would just add our new loan production has a coupon of million right so sure theres fees to be added on top of that but the reality is right now the environment that were in thats million is inconceivable but as clint said weve started taking some of this liquidity to pull back on our loans we get a better rate environment and absolutely we should at the very least be heading back in that trajectory jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay i appreciate it guys i would imagine the strategy is a little more nii focused than an actual margin figure but i appreciate it maybe if i another big picture clint i just wanted to checkin on kind of ma youve been on the sidelines for a while sort of internally focused or investing in the business and wanted to see if if as weve evolved here if youve inched towards looking at any opportunities acquisition wise or its still more lending teams any update on that front would be helpful thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc weve always as weve said ma is in our dna we in the investor deck that was updated put out on the website this morning we have a standing chart which shows our ma history and many of the individuals that have been part of those those past transactions in terms of evaluating and integration are still part of our team today so we still have that expertise a lot of the work that we did over the past year and i kind of touched on it briefly in terms of the proactive approach that we really thought like we were able to take throughout especially the early months of the pandemic because of our pandemic response plan that we had had in place and the fact that we had tested that plan and we activated it and in early january of it really put us in a position to spend the back half of last year focused on continuing to make progress on operational efficiencies continuing to look at opportunities to grow our business and some of those are organic but also we feel like that theres going to be consolidation and i wont use the word significant consolidation within our industry but i just look at the rate environment the pressures that are being faced and i think its going to force some to reevaluate and seek out a bank to partner with and so our goal is to make sure that when they reach that point that were on the short list of who they call i cant really get into much more detail than that but i do think that ma chatter is picking up and were starting to see some things on a national level new announcements that have come out in the quarter and i would expect that youre going to see that trend continue and youll probably see some of that activity within our marketplace columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great thanks for the thoughts clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc you bet operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co i want to start on the margin as well can you give us the new security yields you experienced this quarter in terms of purchases i think it was last quarter maybe start there clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure yeah with the lift in the curbs in the were longer and with that we did see some benefit in our new purchases so that number came up to about for the first quarter and we actually had a few purchases that were over which is the first time i saw that in a while so things are moving in the right direction but obviously weve got more liquidity to deploy and as ppp loans are forgiven thats going to give us more liquidity to work with so i would expect theres more to be done on that front as you noted it should be coming on at a little better yield its not set the mix necessarily that you have but thats but it should be positive to net interest income matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then on the new loan coupons at million i think thats up basis points from last quarter how much of that was kind of driven by mix change or did you start to experience maybe a little bit of better pricing given the steeper curve christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah matt this is chris id say its a little bit of both and some of it depends on obviously the mix of what comes in during the particular quarter size of deal credit aspect of it and things of that nature so it is a bit of a moving columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 target i think that the steepening of the curve certainly helps us and well continue to monitor and pay attention to that matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then aaron do you happen to have the core margin in the month of march i guess what im trying to get at is where your margin might be headed and it seems like if you just use the incremental rates on securities and loans maybe youre layering in some additional fees youre kind of headed toward a kind of a 290ish core margin longerterm but obviously remixing assets would help mitigate that to some degree so just wondering if you had the if you would agree with that and if not why and then if you had monthly nim in march on a core basis that will be helpful clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc i dont have the march number in front of me the i would say that number seems a little extreme but indiscernible is how long are we down in the effectively zero interest rate environment right so its not to mention the mix changes that we just talked about so i would say thats a more pessimistic view that i would have but maybe well see what happens with fed and which way matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co understood no worries and then just on the pipeline the loan pipeline sounds strong can you give us kind of order of magnitude how much it might be up linked quarter i assume yearoveryear comps are a lot easier and less meaningful so andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah matt as far as quartertoquarter it continues to improve some of that is based on what the throughput is how much comes through in any one quarter i will tell you that the while the pipeline is strong we certainly have high expectations for our ability to goto market and the things we can do and were not disappointed and so i think that were seeing our approach over the second half of certainly the second half by is certainly paying dividends were seeing more opportunities our approach with the second round of ppp is paying dividends on new relationships and so were getting plenty of indiscernible and then it all comes down to structure and pricing and things of that nature but were very pleased with where were at and well see how the if we get any rollbacks here in the pandemic and how that might affect things but it appears that people are getting back and engaged taking advantage of a low interest rate environment but also actively investing in their businesses which is all of it indiscernible matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the ppp related stuff the fas benefit this quarter i think in the release you most of the declining comp was related to that but can you quantify the dollar number there and then can you also just confirm how much you have in the way of round one ppp net fees left in round two net ppp fees and the amortization schedule too columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure so yeah the fas related to ppp was about million id also point out that we had some technology fees related to ppp that was about and the other kind of material item in the quarter was we recorded a million provision for unfunded commitments but as far as you think about each of those and what that looks like going forward as youre modeling that also going forward we tend to have a big lift in fico and 401k contributions in the first quarter some of which will go away and as we head into the second quarter and through the year the in terms of the remaining unearned income related to ppp thats about just shy of million at march 31st matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co and how much of that came from round two just so we can amortize that over some five years how much youre assuming something different clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so yeah i guess if you were to assume the straight line amortization then yeah five years so although i wouldnt think about it that way myself but the that there was yeah let me put in this way so at this at yearend we had million in unearned income and of that amount related to ppp one we had million remaining at march so that should give you a sense of how much we added during the first quarter with round two matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay got it indiscernible i just want to make sure i heard you correctly said million of originated deferred fees clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc that is correct matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 good morning david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc i wanted to start on the record nonppp production for first quarter im just curious where the growth came from how much do you think is kind of from an improved economic outlook just giving your clients more confidence in investing versus new client acquisition from the ppp program or the new hires and maybe just kind of whether we started to see any real contribution from the neighborhood comps at all clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc david ill just start with a statement and then ill step back and let chris actually give you some numbers for context but prepandemic the biggest single comment that we would hear from our clients was they could grow their business or more but labor was a constraint for them they just simply couldnt find enough labor or the right skillset of available labor and then i would say the conversation with the clients that ive been in contact with has returned to that dynamic theres going to be pockets as andy talked about the hospitality sector and things but a lot of our business clients are very very busy and they just simply cant get enough people to continue to keep up with all the opportunities that they have in front of them so i do think theres a lot of optimism out there we do feel like the ppp has helped thousands of businesses within our market area but also theres a lot of liquidity thats still there and the other thing that i dont know that we really have spent any time talking about is the disruption in supply chain so things like the chip shortage and how that ripples through and not necessarily directly with our clients but in terms of things theyre investing if theyre looking for a new piece of machinery or something and if that production is idled or delayed because they simply cant get the chips to manage the electronic components so i think those are some of the things that will start to break loose as we go forward and will create additional opportunities for our industry and for us and for the clients so ill step back and let chris add his context christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc actually i dont have the exact numbers on the mix on that but i can tell you that its pretty well diversified its coming from all over the footprint its coming from all of the concepts or the efforts that youve talked probably most notably picking up business because of the approach of being open where were taking advantage of situations where other institutions have closed locations and clients are migrating because of that approach and as far as the neighborhub both neighborhubs that we currently have they certainly support our commercial banking opportunities and theyre performing at or above expectations but theyre really more of their support to whats happening they do drive some small business production certainly and but the bigger benefit is is how they support the overall network and support our support our bankers in total david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats good color and then just kind of following up on your comments coming on the supply chain im just curious what you guys are seeing on the ci side it sounds utilizations have continued to come down but do you think weve hit a trough yet i guess just as clients start needing to build inventory and this improved economic columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 outlook do you think that were kind of at trough levels here or i guess as you talk to clients do you think theyd prefer to use their excess cash before starting to draw lines just curious what your thoughts are there clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well ill start with first quarter is historically our seasonal trough and where we end up and where that picks up sometimes just depends on do we have an early spring or late spring and in particular with some of our cultural clients and weve had a late spring everything here seems to be about five weeks sometimes where we typically would be in terms of weather conditions and while spring is spring is fine we did have a stretch of degree weather followed by stretch of in rain but today its sunny and so definitely starting to see that seasonal seasonally driven activity pick up theres other components in terms of the ci book it also leads to demand besides your comment around clients using their own liquidity but into different business verticals that were in sometimes as their markets heat up or cool down their line utilization also changes so im optimistic about your comment about is this the bottom or the trough but its not a typical year were still in the last well i hope i the last grips of the pandemic as vaccination rates improve and things as andy mentioned various counties within our footprint have sort of backslid or on the cusp of backsliding into various components of restrictions not like what we saw at this time a year ago but certainly it is its just matter of data points that cause us to pause and say the second quarter is not going to be necessarily the same indiscernible seasonal activity in the past might have been outside of some of those things that are very much driven by the weather and the time of year that it is and with that ill pass it to chris i think you would like to add christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc what i would add to that is i think that where were at is somewhat unprecedented and so thinking forward of are we at or near a trough is probably its what were all looking towards its what were optimistic that those things start to change theres a lot of liquidity still on the sidelines i am optimistic that were starting to see some of that liquidity be invested into traditional securities markets and i think thats shown in the results that were seeing in our financial services and trust division of some of that money is now moving to other areas starting to look for additional yield or return on it i think the piece around right now for liquidity if youre certainly sitting on lots of cash at a low interest rate it certainly makes sense to pay down your line but as we start picking up on our production and were seeing that fixed production once that kind of starts working through the system youll start seeing some more opportunistic types of things as we exit the pandemic and then of course i would just echo and reiterate that the late spring certainly has an impact david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats good color and then look the key really to getting back the margin back to where weve talked about is putting on new earning assets its great to hear the increase in the rates on new production im just curious whether youre interested or are you increasingly willing to be competitive on rate in order to drive growth or do you think you can hold the line on rate and still drive the growth that you need to deploy that liquidity and conversely is there any appetite for some potential loan purchases to supplement that before liquidity quicker clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 david i could talk about the production side and ill let aaron to the second part of that question if were given a choice i would much rather and we would much rather compete on rate than on structure and certainly that is a long term aspect of who we are and what we would do i think that several things are at play there our value proposition around relationships doing more than a simple transaction and our process and ability that we stayed open can certainly help in some situations drive a little higher yield a little higher coupon but it all depends on the relationship and as long as we continue to show value and bring other things to the table we cant command a bit higher coupon on that now with that said i will also say theres some very competitive opportunities out there and well look at all of those from a credit aspect first and if it passes through that aspect then we will sharpen our pencil if necessary if it makes sense if its right in our backyard and things of that nature and so we will compete on price selectively its probably the best way to say aaron james deer a analyst columbia banking system inc and in terms of loan purchase i mean obviously we our preferences to use our mining teams to drive around organic production which is a fantastic track record and i think were growing really optimistic about where things are moving going forward weve played weve very selectively made several examples of mortgage purchases or something like that to kind of backfill pay downs or something in that book when our own production isnt quite matching what we want to carry on the balance sheet but ideally what were going to do is drive our own originations and loan growth and if something came along that seemed particularly attractive yeah well take a look but buying lines of big premiums right now doesnt necessarily make a lot of sense to me david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right thanks for the color clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks david operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of cleanup questions here just on the loan production numbers it feels like youre saying this and your peers are kind of saying this as well that economic activity is picking up but its not quite there yet and im just curious some of your earlier comments about your bankers are less burdened with ppp now and theyre looking columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 forward and i guess the big picture question is are you just taking share in terms of your production or is this increased economic activity thats driving this christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc jon its chris i would tell you its both economic activity is certainly starting to increase but as you mentioned it is it is not where it was in i think the fact that we opened forgiveness back in august of last year and have moved considerably through the first round bodes really well for and our approach in the second round with the technology that we had available was pretty seamless and so it was a much easier process for us we expect to see that on the backside of the second round ppp forgiveness as well and so that has really kept our bankers from working on that and being all hands on debt weve got a very streamlined process still requires people but nowhere near as many is as what we experienced last year and so our teams are out and about capitalizing on the opportunities in the markets and it would tell you thats broad based its all three states its all of our regions and theres a real sense of now is the great time for us to be out and talking about our approach and again being open has paid fantastic dividends and the teams are excited so theyre out and about trying to win business so that leads to your part of yeah there were some share thats been acquired jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay andy a question for you how concerned are about deterioration in some of the stressed sectors and that leading into higher nonperformance i mean your numbers are booked for every coin but im just curious on your thoughts on that topic andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc well im obviously surprised at how well all of the segments that weve identified have performed so hospitality would be the first one that i have concerns with in terms of migration into nonperforming assets and that would be that business traveler segment that i talked about before if we look historically we can see the business travel takes for an extended period of time relative to leisure to rebound so that will be the area that i have concern the retail and restaurants continues to just surprise me as i mentioned before retail credit down than it was a year ago and restaurants relatively speaking i guess its meeting expectations that theyre not deteriorating into a nonperforming loans yet but why i would put hospitality first i said the appropriate restaurants next so those will be the two segments that i think we will see some migration into nonaccruals and ultimately there could be a modest amount of chargeoffs there as well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then i guess this is another bigger picture question but just on the reserve level indiscernible cecl i think it was maybe a little above and i know that theres plenty of stuff to be concerned about but can you migrate back there over time is that the right level to think about longerterm andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 yeah i think that with cecl its difficult to say where that migrates longerterm i think in terms of our behavior for this year its pretty consistent with what ive talked about before and where its going to kind of bounce around a little bit and well have some modest relief as we continue to move forward i certainly think that youre going to see it migrate down its just really difficult with a new model to say is the longterm given the volatility of economic forecast now as we continue to get more stable economic forecast and in this case where its stable to slightly improving we are seeing that the model behaves in a more stable manner and to that extent yes you would have the ability to migrate down into one of the quarter and possibly one if you continue to have that stable economic forecast jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks for the help operator our next question comes from jackie bohlen with kbw your line is open jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi everyone good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi jackie wanted to start on capital you obviously have really healthy levels i just wanted to get a refresher on how youre thinking about the i know you used to do a variable special dividend so if that comes up in conversation and im guessing lower appetite for buyback there but just an update would be great clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah we still havent changed our view on in terms of our longterm targets and for many years weve stated that tce of and total capital ratio of is kind of what we think makes sense for us in terms of giving us flexibility to do some things opportunisticly and we are well above those levels but i think that as we progress through and through some of the conversations that well have with our with our board of directors will be around the direction those ratios continue to accept or continue to build and what uses or what tools do we have available to us to start to shift those closer to those longterm targets and there are some things on the horizon that obviously has maintained our regular dividend as you noted special dividends have been a tool that weve used many times over the years in that regard and so i wouldnt i wouldnt rule that out buybacks we have an authorization in place but well be opportunistic and use discretion in terms of to the extent that we engage in buybacks theres also as we talked earlier and i think it was in response to jeffs question and my comments around we do expect that the ma activity in our region will pick up at some point in the coming year and so i guess its a long winded way of saying that our traditional uses of capital are still on the table but that knowing what we know today were comfortable being above those longterm targets columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just thinking about ma i feel like were in a really fluid environment with a lot of moving pieces so just a refresh on how you think about potential targets in terms of size and geography would be great clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc not yet yeah im not going to give you the playbook jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the ticket would be great clint if you could just do that just broadly im trying to get at it if you would look at something youre obviously much larger than you were when you were doing deals in the past and so im trying to get out to the extent that youre not able to that theres not an available target that really moves the needle for you if you would take a look at something strategic but small clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah thats the exact word that i would use and that i had on the tip of my tongue is this the strategic rationale thats when we only talk about ma internally thats the question we always ask is whats the strategic rationale does it make sense what does it bring to us that we dont have how is it additive to our franchise and not diluted to what weve built over the last years and we tend to think about it more along those volumes as opposed to absolute size theres i mean youve seen our growth and in terms of deposits over the past quarter and the past year and so itd be easy to say indiscernible theres this minimum size where we just would even consider ma because our or organic growth just outpaces or we could do it over a certain time horizon but i think thats a little shortsighted and needlessly confines the institution to thinking about that strategic rationale and theres things whether its a tech platform whether its a certain niche expertise that we could gather from it and but all things being equal it does have it does take a larger target to move the needle than what it did for us say years ago or pregreat recession so i dont know if thats helpful for you but thats kind of how we think about it jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fine no it is very helpful great thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jackie operator our next question comes from andrew terrel with stephens your line is open andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey so i wanted to ask just on the deposit growth front so we obviously saw a tremendous amount of deposit growth this past quarter its impressive to see noninterestbearing mix still being so high i was hoping you could speak to just any kind of early trends youre seeing in the month of april just in terms of deposit flows does it feel like things are slowing down with less stimulus being put into the economy can you maybe just update us on how youre thinking about deposit growth throughout the year clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so i guess this is the theme of the day ill start and then let chris and aaron add some comments in respect to the question around line utilization i talked about the seasonality and thats something that we also have seasonality historically in our deposit portfolio and typically the first half of the year in any given year we have little or very little deposit growth or sometimes we actually go backwards and then much of our deposit growth will occur in the third and fourth quarters and so for us to have a quarter like what we had last this past quarter is definitely an outlier from our historical seasonality that we would experience i dont have a crystal ball to necessarily know where well be when we talk after the second quarter here in july but i can certainly say that the first quarter performance was definitely a dramatic departure from what our historical expectations would be for the first quarter or second quarter and with that ill step back and give chris i dont have anything id like to add christopher m merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc indiscernible what id add to it is if you take in consideration the amount of the growth and then you take in that again our investment teams had record production in the first quarter theres a lot of money moving throughout the system and even with that production went into our investment teams we still had the deposit growth and so i think its driven from a few sources and then obviously ppp is part of it theres also a lot of businesses within our regions that are doing phenomenally well and they continue to deposit their money as well and so i think as people start moving to the second quarter travel starts picking up and things of that nature weve seen travel pick up hasnt had a major impact in the first quarter well see how that kind of moves out throughout the second quarter into the summer you may see some of that that liquidity start being deployed now typically what seems to take place is our client may deploy the liquidity but also somebody elses clients deploying the liquidity and it ends up in one of our business accounts and so a little bit of movement around in how the money how the money is changing hands and i think until you start finding ways that liquidity leaves the system this maybe a little bit of an abnormal year for us especially in the first half but again were seeing more money be deployed into investment assets and things of that nature but it hasnt had a tremendous impact yet columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay thats very helpful and then maybe aaron do you have how much in ppp income is included in the loan fee disclosure thats made at the bottom of the margin detail in the release i think the total loan fee dollar was million aaron james deer a analyst columbia banking system inc so in the first quarter we on our ppp program we had earned an interest of just over million we had fees of a little shy of million and then we had accelerated fees a little over million so all in youre looking at about million and the ppp loan yield in the quarter was andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful thanks for taking my questions clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andrew operator there are no further questions please proceed with any closing remarks clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well thank you again for joining us we look forward to continuing our conversation throughout the second quarter and reporting our second quarter results to you in july take care operator well ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference you may now
