without our consent i will now turn the call over to chairman and chief executive officer james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning everyone and thank you for joining us the first quarter of was a significant record for the firm and for many of our businesses it was marked by some truly extraordinary highs numerous performance records the closing of the eaton vance deal our second strategic transaction in the last year and one very complex event relating to the collapse of the hedge fund archegos in summary we generated record revenues of billion and an rotce of the higher revenues reveal the operating leverage in our business and the quarters efficiency ratio was wealth management generated revenues of approximately billion net new assets were billion which is easily our bestever morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 quarterly flows and concrete evidence of the growth trajectory of this business these flows represent an annualized increase of over of beginning period assets pretax margin was this margin should only improve in future years and we expect will exceed as rates tick up daily trades reached a new record with heightened levels of retail client engagement etrade and particularly the strength of the selfdirected channel has exceeded our expectations in addition assets continue to migrate towards advice feebased flows for the quarter were a record billion were adding new clients at a record pace creating more opportunities to consolidate wealth held away and provide advisory services our workplace business is adding corporate plans and as a result the number of participants we reached increased to million institutional securities revenues of billion were also a record as clients remain highly engaged fixed income had their strongest first quarter of the last decade and has consistently gained share in recent years investment banking revenues reached a record driven by record equity underwriting and our equities division also had its best quarter in over a decade turning to investment management on march we closed our acquisition of eaton vance bringing together two highperforming asset managers our teams at both eaton vance and morgan stanley executed the close ahead of schedule while prioritizing client service the momentum eaton vance and msim demonstrated between announcement and close only strengthened our conviction of this combination since we announced the transaction in the beginning of october pro forma assets grew by nearly billion and pro forma net flows were approximately billion in the first quarter pro forma net flows were billion representing an annualized organic growth rate of our industryleading organic growth signals that clients are very supportive of the combination and increasingly recognize the highly differentiated value indiscernible solutions that we offer across the global platform investment management now has assets under management of trillion and is very wellpositioned in key secular growth segments let me discuss the loss we incurred navigating the collapse of archegos first we liquidated some very large single stock positions through a series of block sales culminating on sunday night march that resulted in a net loss of million which represents the amount the client owed us under the transactions that failed to pay us subsequently we made a management decision to completely derisk the remaining smaller long and short positions which while not especially problematic might have been we decided we would be out of the risk as rapidly as possible and in so doing incurred an incremental loss of million i regard that decision as necessary and money wellspent the results are all reflected in q1 im very pleased with how the institution came together and responded to this very complex situation let me close with an early readout from our acquisitions of etrade and eaton vance the performance of both businesses is significantly exceeding our expectations and as importantly the integration so far is proceeding without major incident these acquisitions when combined with our existing wealth and investment management businesses drove our client assets to trillion of which approximately billion represented netnew client assets to the firm this quarter we are more than convinced than ever that both deals help position morgan stanley for growth in the years ahead ill now turn it over to jon to discuss the quarter in detail and together well take your questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 jonathan m pruzan chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced record revenues of billion in the first quarter across businesses and regions performance was incredibly strong as clients remained highly engaged and markets were constructive excluding integrationrelated expenses our eps was our rotce was and our efficiency ratio was first some housekeeping to improve the transparency and comparability of our external financial reporting we made several enhancements to our disclosures this quarter you can find more details and three years restated data on pages and of the supplement the more significant items are as follows for the firm the provision for credit losses for hfi loans and lending commitments is now presented as a separate line in the income statement versus being in other revenues and expenses in institutional securities sales and trading net revenue have been reclassified into equity and fixed income which now includes certain investments and other revenues that are directly attributable to those businesses and other revenues notably contain corporate loans and lending commitments and related hedges as well as the impact of deferred compensation plans and in investment management following the closing of the eaton vance transaction we have simplified reporting by breaking revenues into two lines asset management has been renamed asset management and related fees although the historical numbers remain the same and we have combined the remaining revenue categories under a new line named performancebased income and other notably carried interest we have also updated our aum disclosures alternatives and other has been updated to alternatives and solutions to reflect the addition of most of the parametric aum excluding parametrics portfolio services for institutional investors that have been included in a new line called liquidity and overlay services now to the businesses the momentum in institutional securities witnessed through the back half of continued as clients remained highly engaged several performance records were set as revenues were broad based and balanced across businesses and regions revenues were billion representing a record and a increase compared to the same period last year the integrated investment bank continues to serve clients across the complex regionally asia remained a standout building on the four best quarters of the last decade in the first quarter of this year set a new record europes performance was solid across investment banking and fixed income and was the strongest in over a decade investment banking generated revenues of billion more than doubling the prior year driven by record underwriting results advisory revenues were million reflective of higher completed ma industry volumes versus the prior year equity underwriting continues to be exceptionally active record revenues of billion reflect its strength across products and sectors ipo activity was extremely strong with blocks followons and convertibles also notable fixed income underwriting revenues of million were the second highest only to the second quarter of last year as companies continued to take advantage of the attractive borrowing environment we saw strong activity across noninvestmentgrade financing spread across sponsors and corporate issuers investment banking pipelines remain healthy across products strategic dialogues are active equity markets should support issuance and conditions remain favorable for borrowers and we are seeing a broadening across sectors beyond technology and healthcare equity revenues reached billion the strongest in a decade as global equity market volumes remained elevated derivative results were the best in a decade reflecting heightened client activity and a constructive trading market environment both cash and prime brokerage revenues declined versus the same period last year revenues associated with higher volumes and higher prime brokerage balances respectively were offset by the losses james discussed morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 fixed income revenues of billion was the highest for our first quarter in a decade performance was broad based across products the debate around the speed and strength of the global recovery the passage of us fiscal stimulus and the movement in passive rates supported client activity micro performance continues to be strong the meaningful increase versus the prior year was driven by securitized products and municipals macro results were robust though reflected a decline from the very strong prior year as bidask spreads were more stable this period and commodities also had solid results other revenues of million improved meaningful versus the prior year the increase primarily reflects gains related to deferred cashbased compensation plans compared to losses in the prior year and lower marktomark losses on corporate loans and related hedges turning to isg lending our credit portfolio continues to perform well improved confidence in the economic outlook and paydowns on corporate relationship loans particularly noninvestmentgrade resulted in a release of million net chargeoffs in the quarter were million and our allowance for credit losses on isg loans and lending commitments now stands at billion total isg loans were up billion while lending commitments increased by approximately billion relative to as we continue to support our clients our vulnerable sector portfolio continues to represent less than of the overall isg loans and lending commitments we saw some velocity in the book with new commitments for investmentgrade clients that were largely offset by paydowns approximately of this portfolio like our entire isg portfolio is either investmentgrade or secured and lastly forbearance for the isg portfolio continues to decline and now stands at approximately million turning to wealth management given the timing of the close of the etrade acquisition i will make comparisons to the prior quarter which will serve as a more relevant benchmark than prior year revenues were billion with strength in every area excluding the impact of dcp which declined by approximately million versus the prior quarter revenue increased integrationrelated expenses were million and excluding these costs pretax profit increased to a record billion and the pbt margin was the underlying growth drivers in this business remain extremely strong netnew asset growth was billion driven by netnew clients asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention feebased flows were a record billion and selfdirected channel netnew households grew by a record or financial advisors also recognize the value of our platform demonstrated in continued strength in net recruiting and retention which also benefited nna elevated client activity across both advisorled and selfdirected channels drove strong transactional revenues excluding the impact of dcp revenues increased client engagement in the market was high putting more cash into equities in the quarter selfdirected engagement was particularly robust reflecting record net buying activity daily average trades on the etrade platform reached record highs of million almost higher than the fourth quarter record of million importantly revenuerelated to the etrade platform transactional activity is highly accretive to the pbt margin asset management revenues were billion up sequentially benefiting from higher asset levels and record feebased flows feebased assets are now trillion and have grown over billion from last year greater than the cumulative growth of the prior six years and revenues are up nearly from the prior year loan growth remains extremely robust with balances reaching billion demand across products with particular strength in securitiesbased lending led to quarterly balance sheet growth of billion north of the full year guidance we gave earlier this year continued use of data analytics to understand customer needs is contributing to the strong growth morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 net interest income was billion including prepayment amortization which turned positive and was approximately million excluding prepay nii was up and in line with our prior guidance the increase reflected the realization of funding synergies driven by the onboarding of billion of deposits that were previously swept off etrades balance sheet growth in bank lending balances and increased margin lending in the selfdirected channel we have now completed the onboarding of approximately billion of deposits since we closed the etrade transaction and we remain on pace to realize approximately million in nii funding benefits in we would also expect to runoff additional billion of wholesale deposits through the remainder of the year we expect that nii will continue to build on the full impact of the onboarded deposits and continued growth in lending were even more excited about etrade today than when we announced the deal as momentum on the etrade platform is robust additionally we are beginning to see early successes from the combination the business continues to benefit from increased client engagement across channels as evidenced by this quarters nna and while we expect these flows will be lumpy and should be looked at over the course of a year rather than individual quarters we are encouraged by the strong start we continue to prioritize client experiences as we progress with our integration the rest of will be focused on analyzing the comprehensive datasets which cover advisorled and selfdirected clients to help better understand investment behaviors and needs and refining the tools required to connect financial advisors to service those needs over time we expect to learn from these insights to effectively serve clients across their entire wealth journey workplace will serve as an important growth engine going forward and we are building on the investments we have made todate our workplace offering is resonating with corporate clients we are adding new b2b clients and participants at a record pace and our current pipeline is as strong as its ever been equity plan wins increased by approximately versus last year and this led to the addition of participants to the morgan stanley at work platform our number of participants now stands at million we are also focused on ensuring that each workplace participant has a companion brokerage account to capture vested award proceeds today approximately have one and we expect of participants will have a companion account within months this will further enhance our ability to capture workplace flows on the expense side were on track to realize million of cost synergies in and have made progress in the first quarter towards this end on a run rate basis we expect to achieve to of the targeted million expense synergies by the end of the year moving to investment management on march we closed the acquisition of eaton vance we issued million shares and billion of common equity we created approximately billion of goodwill and intangibles including billion of intangibles of which half will amortize over approximately years our cet1 ratio is impacted by approximately basis points this quarters results include one month of the combined businesses financials so comparisons to prior periods are difficult i will focus mainly on the quarter and our positioning moving forward we are pleased that the businesses retain their strong momentum from announcement to close and total aum now stands at trillion an increase of or billion on a pro forma basis versus the prior year upon close eaton vance added approximately billion to our total aum the underlying fundamentals of this business remain extremely strong positive net flow momentum continued across both businesses total net flows on a pro forma basis were billion for the full quarter longterm pro forma net flows of billion were broad based across products and regions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 we saw particular strength in msim global equity strategies which continued to attract robust flows following strong investment performance parametric customized portfolios continued very strong organic growth in the alternative and solutions line we believe customization is a longterm secular trend and parametric is the market leader in this space eaton vances leading floating rate loan business recovered to strong positive flows and calvert saw strong growth as esg investing accelerates in the quarter revenues were billion consistent with strong growth in aum the contribution for more durable management fee revenue has meaningful increase and asset managementrelated fees were billion with just one month of eaton vance contribution performancebased income and other revenues were million in the quarter we saw broadbased gains across our alternative funds the increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by gains in our real estate funds which continued their recovery from total expenses were million of which integrationrelated expenses were negligible turning to the balance sheet total spot assets increased to trillion reflecting higher client activity levels and the addition of eaton vance standardized rwas were flat to the prior quarter at billion and our standardized cet1 ratio declined from the prior quarter to our tax rate was for the quarter and we continue to expect our full year tax rate will be approximately we are pleased with our results in the first quarter as our three worldclass businesses of scale delivered exceptional performance and growth pipelines are healthy institutional and retail client engagement is strong and our global positions have improved with the successful closing of the eaton vance deal we continue to drive our business model towards more durable more recurring and less capitalintensive businesses while its very early in the integration the combination of breadth and depth of product offerings and services with our enlarged customer base has led to approximately billion of netnew client assets to the franchise and our unique business model is wellpositioned for growth through a variety of market backdrops with that we will now open the line to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc id like to ask maybe first on wealth management the netnew asset growth rate implying doubledigit organic is really impressive not something that the narrative around wirehouses failing to be able to grow really jives with so im curious i know weve seen these trends accelerate from morgan stanley for over a year now but how much of this remarkable quarter was attributable to etrade versus fullservice wealth management at morgan stanley and how should we think about a sustainable organic netnew asset growth going forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well brennan let me have a go at that i mean historically the growth rate as you probably know in the full service as you call it wirehouses has been i dont know to over the last years with loss of financial advisors some loss of assets into the ria channel and clearly loss to some of the direct distributors and generally just not having in place significant growth plans and i think this quarter and ill talk about the absolute levels in a minute but this quarter is reflective of a very different view of that wealth management business number one we needed to have a compelling direct channel we have that through etrade number two we needed to have a compelling workplace platform we have that through solium and etrade number three we needed to have netpositive fa growth in terms of recruiting not in just numbers of bodies but actual people who are bringing assets and were doing that and number four you need a compelling platform of ideas which link to our institutional business and the quality research and product youre just operating at a different level and so i think its a culmination actually of a lot of things etrade is clearly a factor in it but its by no means the only factor if you took out etrade the organic growth was tremendous in the core business which again weve started to see in the last couple of years i think we showed some numbers last year of around our target i think was to now this at while q1 is probably going to be your best quarter q2 usually has some tax factors tax flows going on but listen the growth rate is real if we annualize a year for the next several years that would be spectacular but thats certainly not what were planning on and i got to be realistic but to be outgrowing some of our nontraditional competitors even per quarter its a wonderful greenshoot to have planted out there morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc no doubt thanks for that color james and then thinking about nii within the wealth management business jon you made some comments on nii but i wasnt sure if those were just purely on wealth or implied when we think about it on the wealth management business thanks for quantifying the prepay impact is this youve got strong loan growth weve got securities yields that have been recovering since yesterdays setback so should we be expecting continued constructive trends in core nii exing out any noise that might happen from prepay quartertoquarter jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure i think the short answer is yes weve really got some nice tailwinds from the loan growth that weve been experiencing as well as the deposit funding synergies i think as i said in the first quarter we dont expect any movement in policy rates the short end is really what benefits the nii so our growth we would expect from the full realization of the onboarding of deposits which as you know was feathered in over the quarter and so that will have the full impact next quarter at billion of loan growth were running ahead of plan there so thats obviously a nice tailwind and then as i said well continue to see our deposit costs tick down as some of the incremental wholesale deposits runoff because of the onboarding so we feel good about the guidance we gave you the billion in the fourth quarter was a good run rate and then start to add the tailwinds from the deposits as well as the loan growth we also saw some nice loan growth in margin lending which is not in the bank but is part of the wealth management nii story so again just a nice quarter and we would expect it to continue to grow from these levels brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the color operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question on the archegos development so james you noted that you were pleased with how the firm responded just given the complexity of the situation what were some of the learnings from that experience and just maybe more importantly how does it inform your risk management approach within pb to ensure that you can avert a similar situation in the future morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i think i mean my comment about the way this team has worked together now for a decade we all went through the financial crisis most of us in sort of a job a level below where we are now so id say the accumulated both scar tissue and experience is very real and we have a philosophy we cauterize bad stuff and deal with it as soon as we possibly can this was as you know a very unusual event it was a family office actually no outside money it got to enormous size by the growth in their single stock position a very concentrated single stock long position that had explosive growth and theyre offset by the very shorts and the indices that they were short so it was and i think what the lessons are still unfolding if you will or learnings steve but its not going to change how we feel about the prime brokerage business at all this is a gem of a business that weve probably generated i dont know something close to billion in revenue in a decade its a core part and backbone of the equities business so it doesnt change that at all but i think well certainly be looking hard at family officetype relationships where theyre very concentrated and you have multiple prime brokers and frankly the transparency and lack of disclosure relating to those institutions is just different from the hedge fund institutions and thats something im sure the sec is going to be looking at and thats probably good for the whole industry better information is always good in rooting out where potential problems can be so obviously theres not a lot i can and should be saying publicly about it but as i said were never happy taking a loss but our job is to deal with the facts as reality and get on top of it and get it done and thats what we did and we took the extra bit frankly just to clean it up by quarter end we didnt want this thing to be lingering steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats helpful color james and certainly appreciate your candor on the topic just for my followup another one on nii jon i just wanted to get a sense looking at the cost of deposit disclosure nice to see that come in from bps to basis points and one of the things that were thinking about just given some of the funding benefits from etrade as well as just some highercost wholesale deposits that start to roll off where should we expect that number to ultimately bottom and is that what informs those benefits at least your expectation that we should be able to grow or build nii from here going forward jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley so the weighted average cost of deposits is basis points it will clearly continue to tick down over the course of the quarter assuming rates shortterm rates dont move and again were not expecting policy rates to move as the wholesale higher cost wholesale deposits roll off i think as you recall when we originally announced the transaction i think we talked about billion of funding synergies weve revised that to billion given the growth in deposits we said that we would realize that and billion of which will be realized this year so we have incremental deposit and funding synergies that will be captured in so all of the sort of the movement if you will in the cost of deposits is sort of factored into our funding synergy calculations so the way we generally have been thinking about it is that the policy rates arent going to move so theres not going to be necessarily a big plus or minus from rates and nii will grow because the quantum will grow based on loan growth and then we pick up the funding synergies steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 thats great color jon thanks for taking my questions jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks james i think you covered some of the stuff that i wanted to cover on archegos but a couple quick followups i still want to get to what was so complex about this one is it really just the family office nature and the less disclosure on the multiple primes and the leverage it employed because obviously whats been great about your pb business is i mean you didnt even lose money in you have the assets historically when you have the assets and things break you look for more collateral before you blow out the positions what was different about this one and what do you think why wasnt it disclosed why didnt this meet the materiality test and then what do you think regulators want to change going forward thanks sorry for the followups james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well glenn ill try and touch on a couple of them and to be honest there was a lot going on in this quarter and so i dont want to spend too much talking about a specific client situation which is now done and history but let me touch on a couple of things going sort of reverse order why we didnt disclose we were having a record quarter the business isg was having a record quarter the equities business where this resided was having a record quarter so youve got to be at a level where its material to the overall quarter and ill leave that up to the lawyers but were very comfortable with that frankly given how the firm was performing i think we generated billion revenues more than our previous record quarter out of i dont know quarters that weve had since our origination so youve got to sort of focus on the big picture on that one what was different about this situation relative to and yeah youre right i dont think weve had we went back through the records and i dont think weve ever had and ever is a long time but a loss in the pb business and the business is back to the previous question from steve the business is very well riskmanaged and has been for decades now and were the number one prime broker in the world we were the number one prime broker in this particular instance there were enormous positions because of the rapid growth of the fund they were levered across multiple prime brokers and as i said their disclosure rules as i understand them and im not the expert on it made it more difficult to understand exactly who was holding what where and thats something that well work through and thats part of the learning experience it was complicated i will say last comment on this by the fact that one of the large single stock positions related to a security in which we have been an underwriter and we thought the right thing to do was to close that previous underwriting which happened on that friday so we had to hold off which caused us to be later than some if you will and the reason for that was not that we werent aware of what was going on we just felt we had an underwriting obligation to deal with so anyways its a long story but again in the context of equities business equities had a record with this built into it which is pretty extraordinary glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 i appreciate that and then on workplace its such a good growth and good margin business on its own how do you execute you mentioned the companion accounts over the next months how do you execute on that and then how do you execute on morphing them to the allimportant wealth management advisory relationship technical difficulties jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley can we have the next question please operator and our next question comes from christian bolu with autonomous your line is now open christian bolu q analyst autonomous good morning hope everyone can hear me jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley we can now sorry about that christian bolu q analyst autonomous perfect no worries okay just circling back to the wealth management business the organic growth there look was pretty spectacular at north of and i was wondering if you can give more detail on the legacy financial advisor business i hear you on etrade and workplace but the vast majority of the business is still the fa business and its really surprising to see this level of growth so just curious how much did recruiting for example drive growth have you made any changes to the recruiting incentives that youre paying out to drive more growth just trying to understand some of the core drivers of the strength here jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure christian its jon ill take that i would say just first on net recruiting i think youve heard us talk about this for the last several quarters weve been very active weve become a destination of choice so all the comments that james made about the breadth of the platform the intellectual capital the technology investments that weve made have made our platform and our company a place where fas want to do business so weve seen higher levels of recruiting pipeline as we bring in fas and they are successful and they like the platform theyre obviously talking to their previous colleagues and therefore its sort of accelerating so weve seen really nice net recruiting were bringing in bigger teams better teams and attrition has dramatically slowed down so thats point number one in terms of just the contribution of nna it was really across all the comments that i made net recruiting aided in the nna the etrade platform contributed to the contribution new clients in the fa channel bringing in existing clients away so just broadbased activity very very active we talked about client engagement being quite spectacular this quarter and it really aided those numbers but broadbased morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 christian bolu q analyst autonomous okay thank you and then on ficc to your point its been a while since weve seen this level of revenues in that business and you called out securitized products as a real strength which i think has always been a bigger business for morgan stanley maybe any more details on that business and whats driving growth is it anything to do with the state of the mortgage markets and the strength there just trying to get more color on sort of maybe that business and whats driving the strong growth there jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure and again i think that as i said the ficc business it was really every business in all geographies contributed to that quarter billion of revenue the team is working extremely well together we are gaining share in that business the depth of the franchise continues to improve as you can imagine in this environment where the debate around rates and inflation and credit and yield so generally speaking the credit products have been quite active and volumes have been quite elevated also its being aided by the primary calendar agency issuance so just a lot of good activity going on in credit and i think as you saw this quarter a lot of debate around rates inflation reflation which really added to those results christian bolu q analyst autonomous okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well great timing with your etrade acquisition and i guess retail volumes are some two to three times higher than historical from what i can tell are you seeing those trends continue through the end of march and do you expect that to reverse as we get out of the pandemic and people get out of the house and stop trading as much or maybe this is secular jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure mike yeah no were really pleased with the timing of the transaction as you highlight just if you look at number of clients volumes trades all of the metrics that we historically look at in that business theyre dramatically higher today than they were when we announced the transaction back in february of last year so were also seeing that same engagement across the faled channel so its not just related to etrade so i think client engagement is very very strong at million average trades thats on top of a million average trade in the fourth quarter which was a record it was less than million over the course of last year so were clearly at elevated levels do i think we go back to the or trades they were doing in no but can we sustain this level no ones got a crystal ball but right now clients are extraordinarily engaged and well have to see how this plays out over time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 okay james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley mike ill just add the two kickers there will be some obviously these markets wont stay at this kind of retail activity forever but the two strategic kickers behind this business which are yet to really have the impact that they will have are obviously the deposits and as rates rise that will be a phenomenal additive and secondly the whole workplace as were integrating with solium and thats proving we had some stats in there i think about million plus clients in there but thats a huge growth business for us and i think thatll be sort of the story of the next five years as much as the very elevated activity will be mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then my separate question goes back to archegos so if i heard you correctly you had million of losses and that compares to record equities anyway billion of revenues over the past decade in prime brokerage but within all the news around this i guess it was just press reports saying that you didnt have losses so i think its a little bit of a surprise and does speak to risk management and so i guess my question is are you how much of your prime brokerage business relates to family offices since youre saying youre taking another look at that and why do you think it was that you were the only large bank to call out losses of this magnitude when others didnt i mean did you i dont know what you guys did differently versus citibank comerica chase morgan and goldman sachs or maybe they didnt disclose it i just dont know if you can share some color on that that would be great james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well ill give you a couple of things just on the were in a quiet period so there are certain times when you cant comment about the business unless you sort of preannounce earnings which we werent going to do given that it was a record so secondly im not going to comment on other firms some of them werent even prime brokers to this institution i dont think so each of them have their own bid and they make it and thirdly the context is the business is a phenomenal business its being riskmanaged very well this was a very unusual incident i think the family office i dont have those numbers jon might but i suspect its less than of the prime brokerage business jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley very small james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley very small so yeah mike i mean listen were quite transparent about this we dont like to take losses ever unfortunately when you intermediate flows of capital you sometimes says thats what our whole margin book is and the question is once youre faced with the reality how does the team come together to deal with it and i think they did as i said i think they did a really good job mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 all right thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thanks for taking the questions first just on the trading front obviously robust quarter even with some of those losses i realize its difficult to gauge the outlook but just what drivers are you seeing that could continue to drive activity versus normalize it and how has your market share been trending during this environment jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley its a great question and again without the crystal ball ill just give you some sort of perspective on what we saw in the first quarter and then we collectively can decide whether we think thatll persist for what period of time we clearly still have strong asset values i mentioned we have healthy pipelines and clients are significantly engaged both retail and institutional markets are open theres lots of liquidity and we are seeing a continuation of the accelerating economic data around the globe obviously news coming out of china this morning or last night in terms of the growth recovery so really good backdrop or macro backdrop as james mentioned seasonality the first quarter is usually the strongest typically it wasnt last year but typically it is the strongest in these businesses we are confident that we have the ability to deliver on the objectives that we set out earlier this year in terms of our strategic goals we do believe and i think the data supports that were gaining market share across all of our businesses so thats something that we would expect to persist and i think this year is really going to be focused on that just growing our market shares and integrating these two very important acquisitions michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay great and then just as a followup just on the wealth and investment management organic growth obviously very strong james you mentioned some of the retail activity could moderate i guess maybe on the flip side both etrade and eaton vance theyre very early its early innings in terms of integrating it and getting to like the maximum potential so what are some of those initiatives over the next one to two years that you feel like could maybe partially offset any normalization that we eventually get jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley well i think james mentioned a couple of those already i mean i think what weve said all along were going to be very deliberate with the integrations these deals were not about costs they were about growth and we do not want to we dont want to disrupt the client experience we obviously want to enhance it over time so we are being very deliberate were investing in the platforms were investing in the service model and we are in the process as weve mentioned before of sort of gathering data and running pilots to make sure that we understand what we need so we can service our clients better so for example were defining running pilots around lead generation were defining the fas that will be part of that program were looking at data analytics and scoring models were making the investments in the engine that will help us match the fa to the client based on specific morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 needs and the goal really for this year is to make sure that we have the pipes the people and the process to be able to support our clients in the coming years so we think theres huge potential james mentioned the million workplace participants were only clients outside of that channel with about half of those that business continues to grow the great thing about that business is that its scalable think of it as a huge funnel of opportunities to further enhance client relationships that experience is digital so it is very very scalable and we would expect real growth not only in that channel but to drive growth across the platform really out of the workplace james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley and just to add to it i cant tell you how excited i am about the combination of these four businesses the eaton vance our own investment management business our traditional core wealth management business and etrade and how this is transforming the place by providing so many growth verticals i mean look at the parametric product in eaton vance its extraordinary theyve done an unbelievable job calvert funds with everything going on in the sustainability space as i said the workplace with etrade and what weve done with solium there and now well be one of the top two workplace providers in the world things that we can do to expand internationally taking eaton vances product using our international distribution putting some of our core equities product on the eaton vance domestic distribution they have a great capability there so its just there are so many verticals now which are driving growth and once upon a time when we had the core business at sort of number of financial advisors and productivity per financial advisor thats basically the only two metrics you needed to follow and now weve got like different things that are bobbing along so sort of watch this space my target is trillion of money under management ive told the team internally they hate that but you know what i told danny simkowitz a couple of years ago that my target i said on a public platform was trillion assets under management in the wealth asset management business and he correctly pointed out its revenues per asset its not assets and i said yeah i know but id like trillion with high revenues per asset and guess what weve got trillion when we started the wealth management journey years ago we had billion under management now we have trillion and so were heading to trillion weve got all these growth verticals and i just couldnt be more excited about it operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much maybe just a little more color on the workplace i feel like its a good growth and good margin business on its own but nirvana is the ability to transition them over to a total wealth management advisor relationship over time so the question is how do you execute on that you mentioned companion accounts but do you make research available what products do you push across how do you premarket to them to convert them because it takes time thanks james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah glenn jons going to answer but sorry about cutting off before wasnt personal trust me i like you i dont know quite what happened but i told the team lets get you back on for another go at it so good to have you back morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley so i think you sort of highlighted some of the things that are going to drive the growth going forward i mean again we want more corporate accounts were seeing the pipeline very strong the hit rate is higher and the product is really resonating we then want to grow the participants and then once the participants are in the system we need to build trust and relationships with them through content through education and through services because the ultimate goal as you said is to convert them to a broader client and when we first convert them were reasonably indifferent whether they go into the selfdirected channel the fa channel a virtual channel because thatll just give us an opportunity to build that relationship deepen that relationship as the clients requirements and services and needs change well be able to grow with them and so your comment about migrating one across a wealth client across the different platforms will be the ultimate goal but first we want to build trust with them bring them into the morgan stanley relationship and then try to one of the keys is to try to have that integrated experience across the platforms for the client so thats a lot of the technology that were trying to build too so we want to bring them in deepen the relationship and then let them go to the channel that best suits them glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thanks and thanks james im very confident in our relationship i appreciate that james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good to hear operator thank you our next question comes from kian abouhossein with jpmorgan your line is now open kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah thanks for taking my questions the first one is on fixed income as you know youre a very credit indiscernible player and clearly thats been performing extremely well i just wanted to see how youre thinking about that business more on a longerterm more stable environment around credit and with your macro pieces being a bit weaker so can you talk a little bit about the mix and if youre happy about the mix or what opportunities do you see to further grow the rates indiscernible area jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley i think the short answer again is that were very pleased with the performance from the fixed income business weve deepened the breadth of the franchise as you said credit has historically been a strong point for us but were seeing good results and good penetration in both the macro as well as the commodity space and so again we think weve gained market share since weve restructured this business were probably a or player before were now probably a maybe even 10plus player we would expect to maintain that market share going forward potentially increase it or grow it a little bit more but weve been very pleased with the balance of the business and the results over the last several years in this business morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc and coming back to archegos i mean you are a great number one pb player but clearly family offices and high concentration with low transparency by clients is reflected by the margins that you take so as a result im sure your risk office will take margins and do simulations on a so to say unwinding of the position and in that you have lost significant amount of money so im just trying to understand how youre thinking about not just the family office needs more disclosure needs to be reviewed but more around your margin requirement and how youre thinking about your business in terms of risk management and in that context if you could also maybe highlight to me if all your synthetic prime brokerage business is on a dynamic basis or on a fixed basis in terms of margins james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley ill just make one comment and ill let jon add a couple of comments but weve answered and addressed this topic and im sure well have plenty of opportunity to talk about it in the future but this is a pretty small part of what we do as a whole firm but i think the comment i want to make is family offices are not bad per se i want to be very clear about that we have some phenomenal family office clients and they are all over the world tremendous institutions so lets not throw the baby out with the bathwater here this is not a judgment call on family offices this is a very idiosyncratic event and ill let jon if you want to add anything more to it but i dont want to overlabor this issue jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i would just and i think just pulling some of the threads of your questions together just make a couple more observations first as we obviously are looking across all of the portfolios james mentioned were looking at our stress testing methodology and we will recalibrate it if and where its appropriate to do so number one your comment about margin and collateral i mean i think the way that we think about it is we had collateral based on a certain set of facts that turned out not to be true and as james mentioned it wasnt necessarily it was a family office it wasnt necessarily that they had large concentrated positions it really came down to the fact that this firm had large positions the same positions in the same names at other banks across the street and it wasnt apparent to us so i think thats what isolates the situation here or makes it more unique we scrubbed the portfolio we havent found anyone that has similar fact patterns or copycat strategies and well continue to be diligent around all of those points kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks for your answers operator thank you our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey great good morning so wanted to ask a question about the recent announcement to offer a few specific bitcoinrelated funds to wealth management clients and appreciate you had to walk before you run here and its pretty small but just given how fast the ecosystem is developing and the interest in the space love to just maybe morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 get some thoughts on i guess one what the reaction was internally and then two just thoughts more broadly as youre thinking about the crypto space across the organization jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure and i think your comments are very appropriate its a fastgrowing space theres a lot of interest in the space and we had significant interest from our wealth clients to try to get access to this new asset class and so we tried to facilitate that weve allowed within our wealth management platform qualified investors to get access through two specific passive funds if you will that give access to the cryptocurrency the uptake and the interest level has been strong and we would expect people to continue to be interested in this space and well continue to monitor it and evolve and were in the business of trying to provide services and investment opportunities that interest our client base and as we continue to see more or stronger interest well continue to try to work with the regulators and others to provide services that we think are appropriate devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific if i can squeeze in a quick followup here just on the spac market clearly it has played a role and i think the record amount of investment banking activity in the market really started to lock up a bit over the past month on the pipe side and now the sec is adding some more scrutiny here so id just love to maybe think about the backlogs there and expectations moving forward to kind of work through those backlogs and then can the ipo market kind of do a handoff here the traditional route of going public if the spac market slows jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure i mean listen the spac or the product itself is just another financing vehicle just like a private placement or a direct listing and even with those incremental and new products the traditional ipo product has been very active very strong and weve been a market leader in that space you appropriately point out that the backlog i think is over spacs on file so i would expect that well continue to see more issuance there seems to be a pause as the market is digesting this and the regulators are looking at it so i dont want to get in front of that but there is clearly interest in this product both from an issuer and a buyer perspective and i think it does also add to some of the momentum in the ma products but id also point out theres a couple hundred million dollars of sort of spac money that can be levered and put into the ma environment but theres also trillion of dry powder with the private equity firms so if you put multiples or leverage on those theres a lot of buying power so i think thats also a good driver of the ma market going forward devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great thanks jon jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 operator thank you our next question comes from jeremy sigee with bnp exane paribas your line is now open jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom hi there thank you i wanted to carry on the discussion about the revenue growth drivers in wealth management because i agree with you i think the upside is huge from that is it too early to see signs of revenue synergy between etrade and the workplace channel and the advisor channels whether its customers bringing in assets held away or starting to crossover into other channels and use other services i mean can you see signs of that yet or is it too soon jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i mean i think as i mentioned we are seeing some anecdotal signs of that we are running some pilot programs we think were capturing some of the traditional etrade clients who might have left that platform for incremental advice and now theyre staying with us and working with our financial advisory platform so i think theres some very good early signs and i think youre seeing some of that obviously in the nna the other point i would make is in terms of the workplace retention when we announced the transaction we targeted a retention rate there its early days but were pleased with the progress that were making etrade is still the etrade platform retention rate is still well above so we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on that and as we get further along on this journey well start to give you more color on that but early anecdotes are quite positive jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom okay great and could i just ask a followup a technical question on archegos and i know youre fed up with this topic but just a technical question does the fact of the loss which is now in your data history does that have any mechanical calculation impact on risk weightings or capital requirements in your pb business jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley again the volatility related to this event was as james said was very short in terms of time series so i think the answer is it will not have a meaningful impact to the overall capital requirement jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom okay thank you very much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank
