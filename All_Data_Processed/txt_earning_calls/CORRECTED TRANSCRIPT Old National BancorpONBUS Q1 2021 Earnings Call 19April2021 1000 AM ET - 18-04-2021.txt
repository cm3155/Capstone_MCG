starting on slide we are pleased to share our first quarter results earnings per share were earnings per share were positively impacted by our reserve release brendon will fill you in on all the details but despite the release our earnings would have exceeded consensus estimates old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 adjusted pretax preprovision are up yearoveryear as a result of the implementation of the onb way adjusted operating leverage also improved over basis points and our efficiency ratio was other highlights for the quarter include in the period commercial loans excluding ppp increased annualized because of record first quarter commercial production of million endofperiod total deposits increased more than million which was higher on an annualized basis and our loantodeposit ratio is now a very low net interest income dollars were relatively unchanged consistent with our guidance wealth management assets under management grew nicely mortgage revenue was seasonally stronger than expected and all expense categories were slightly better than we had planned during the quarter we worked hard with our clients on the sba forgiveness process for round one ppp loans and originating new round two loans our team helped the sba fund almost loans in the first round of those applications have been forgiven by the sba already our focus on the forgiveness process had allowed our clients to achieve forgiveness faster than most im also proud of the work we have done to support the second round we have processed almost applications totaling million with an average loan size of most of our credit quality metrics improved during the quarter with consistently better than economic forecast and the massive stimulus programs we reduced reserves consistent with our modeling we still have approximately of our reserves supported by qualitative adjustments given the higherthanaverage level of economic uncertainty that exists today we continue to proactively downgrade our pandemicimpacted loans in the ph watch asset quality ratings and are still meeting weekly to review credit quality loan by loan we continue to believe that our historically strong and consistent underwriting practices diverse and greater loan portfolios and midwest footprint should help us weather the impact better than most a quick update on hiring we have added some excellent candidates during the quarter and we continue to have a good pipeline of opportunities we have a fantastic story to tell and we have strong interest from people wanting to join our team lastly despite the ongoing distractions we have remained focused on serving our clients and communities and i think our results are indicative of our efforts ill now turn the call over to brendon brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you jim turning to slide both our gaap and adjusted earnings per share were adjusted earnings exclude million in onb way related charges as well as million in debt securities gains moving to slide we are pleased with our quarterly adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue which was higher yearoveryear and despite the challenging operating environment we generated basis points of positive operating leverage slide shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning asset mix total average loans excluding ppp grew million or end of period commercial loans increased million driven by record first quarter commercial production of million commercial activity remained strong throughout our footprint with production wellbalanced among our major markets commercial production yields increased quarteroverquarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 to of which were floating rate even with our seasonally strong production our quarter end pipeline increased over prior quarter to billion we believe the current pipeline with over million in the ph accepted category should lead to another strong quarter of production the investment portfolio also increased in the quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced loan growth we are taking a disciplined approach to putting excess liquidity to work in our investment portfolio with new money yields of and a portfolio duration well within five years moving to slide periodend and average deposits increased during the quarter by and respectively this growth has largely come from higher business and personal savings rates that have resulted from changing spending patterns and added liquidity from the various government stimulus actions during the quarter turning to pricing our total cost of deposits was basis points for the quarter a 2basispointimprovement over q4 in our continuing efforts to drive funding costs lower we also reduced average borrowings this quarter by million next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin net interest income declined million quarteroverquarter largely due to the decrease of million in ppprelated interest and fees excluding the impact of ppp net income was in line with our expectations with a slight million decline predominately due to fewer days in the quarter net interest margin declined basis points this quarter to due to lower ppp fees fewer days and additional excess cash for margin excluding accretion and ppp fell basis points to excess cash and fewer days accounted for basis points of the decline with the remainder due to new business rates on loans and investments slide still trends in adjusted noninterest income adjusted noninterest income of million in the first quarter was slightly lower than the million weve recorded in q4 the million decline was primarily driven by lower capital markets income mortgage revenues were better than expected with unseasonably strong first quarter production of million and elevated gain on sale margins we also saw a nice growth in our wealth segment due to increases in assets under management and progress in our onb wayrelated initiatives next slide shows a trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for onb wayrelated charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million these results are slightly better than what we outlined in our fourth quarter call and they included million reversal a provision for unfunded commitments which runs through the other expense category we do not anticipate additional material reductions in our unfunded reserve in the nearterm included in our total expenses in q1 were million in charges related to onb way strategic plan we have just completed the migration of our data center to an offset location costs related to this migration will be reported in q2 earnings and should be immaterial the second quarter charges should be the last of the onb way related cost to impact earnings turning to ppp loans on slide you will see a record of those balances which stood at billion at quarter end we continue to assist round clients with forgiveness with approximately formally through the sba forgiveness process we have seen stronger demand in round than we anticipated having originated just under million through march as of late last week round applications totaled million with corresponding fees totaling approximately million this brings the total unamortized fees on ppp loans from rounds and to million we would old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 anticipate most round loans to be forgiven and the corresponding recognition of the fee income to occur late in with that i will turn it over to daryl to discuss credit daryl d moore chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp thank you brendon slide reflects the performance of our loan portfolio both on the current quarter and historical trend basis total 30plus day delinquencies continued their downward trend for the third consecutive quarter following the basis points at the most recent quarters end as our commercial delinquencies have historically been on the low side the improvement we have seen over the past several quarters had been concentrated in the retail portfolio stimulus payments higher levels of discretionary funds as a result of reduced spending during the pandemic and seasonal income tax refunds are all likely contributing factors to the historically low retail delinquency rates we will have to see what subsequent quarters may bring on the delinquency front but the current level is in all likelihood unsustainable in the longterm net chargeoffs were wellcontained with a very small net recovery posted in the quarter the lack of chargeoffs has certainly been a very pleasant surprise given where we feared we might be back in march of last year over the past several quarters we have been of the mind that chargeoffs associated with pandemic would be pushed out to the first and second quarter of this year at this point in time we are not seeing a strong potential for significant chargeoffs in the portfolio although they certainly could occur if we get a setback in the progress we are making on the pandemic front or the economy stalls for some reason nonperforming loans fell slightly in the quarter with both nonaccrual and restructured loans reflecting modest decreases in the period as you can see the gap between old national and its peers in this particular metric has favorably narrowed over the last several years we continue to perform well in the net chargeoffs to nonperforming loan category as you can see over the past three years our peers results have ranged from roughly to while we have reflected results in the to range with the net recovery results in the current quarter were off to a good start in this category for the combination of swift vaccine rollout and generous government stimulus programs have certainly led to a more rapid economic recovery than many of us could have imagined months ago i believe we all acknowledge and understand how fortunate we are to have escaped a longer and more severe economic downturn than we experienced however in our opinion we need to take this opportunity to step back and see how we might change approaches to forward views of risk identification management i think the industry does a relatively good job of understanding credit risk based on historical performance but many of us had to scramble back in march of last year to try to figure out how an unprecedented event like a pandemic was going to impact our loan portfolios going forward in retrospect we were able to get the job done but the way we accomplish this was not as efficient or as specifically forward riskoriented as we might have wished we have ongoing efforts in the bank attentive on learning from this experience and intend to take steps even in the near term to make ourselves better on this front old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 with that ill turn the call back over to brendon brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you daryl on slide you will see the details of our first quarter allowance of million which is a decline of million from q4 the improving economic outlook including the impact of a successful vaccine rollout and most recent government stimulus led to an million decrease in reserve needs the improving underlying quality of our loan portfolio led to an additional million reduction as you recall we were measured in our approach the reserve build at the onset of this crisis and will be similarly thoughtful if the economy improves and although the economy is clearly strengthening there remains an aboveaverage amount of uncertainty as a result we are holding larger amount of qualitative reserve today than as typical and we will continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance and make the appropriate adjustments to our reserves in future quarters i would also like to remind you that we continue to carry million in unamortized market from our acquired portfolios and while these markets will not directly offset chargeoffs any remaining market will increase through margin upon resolution as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we were very pleased with the fundamental results of the quarter record first quarter commercial production and earnings asset growth helped us deliver on the stable net interest income we guided through last quarter our fee businesses particularly mortgage and wealth continued to perform well and our credit quality metrics continue to exceed expectations slide includes thoughts on our outlook for we ended the quarter with a healthy billion commercial pipeline which included million in the accepted category lower new businesses lower new business and reinvestment rates will continue to put pressure on net interest margin but we expect net interest income to remain stable through continued earning asset growth the ppp loan forgiveness process continues for our round clients and round production is going well we expect runoff of round balances to occur in the latter half of and the recognition of most of the related million in amortized fees to occur at that time we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well we were encouraged by the momentum in our mortgage and wealth businesses but performance will be subject to industry trends a strong commercial activity and rate environment should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business deposit service charges continue to lag historical levels with the receipt of additional stimulus further delaying the return of this revenue line to prepandemic levels other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term expenses should increase in with their annual merit increases that were effective in early april and we do not anticipate any additional material recapture and the reserve for unfunded commitments we are generally comfortable with the current consensus estimates on expenses for the remainder of the year lastly a brief update on taxes we continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we work through the last of the remaining one year historical tax credit commitments in total we are expecting approximately million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of approximately with that were happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp scott youre back r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys i know you remembered didnt need a repeat of last quarter but i appreciate indiscernible so hey good morning i hope you guys are doing well and appreciate the question you taking the question maybe first place to start off is just on the nuance of the margin the core margin ex paas and ppp down to about ph million maybe thoughts on whats going on there and i guess more importantly order of magnitude of further pressure just as you see it brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes scott this is brendon yeah i think its difficult for us to pinpoint where the margin is headed obviously the excess liquidity in the system is putting pressure on margins but our focus has been and will continue to be maintaining the interest income stable we think we have the earning asset growth potential to do that and thats where well be focused r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect and then just on the lending side i mean you guys are really bucking the trend by showing any growth on the commercial side which is good guess im curious jim to hear your thoughts on competition and the dynamic there now that were more successfully reopening broadly speaking are your competitors doing the same thing or is it still an environment where you guys are just really wellpositioned to continue to take market share particularly in some of your newer markets james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yes scott jim sandgren here yeah we continue to be really opportunistic i think as weve shared in the past calls weve been out were out calling our leadership team has been out in the markets the last few months and if new clients and prospects are willing to see us were out making calls so really liked the frame of mind i will tell you that competition is certainly starting to heat up particularly on the commercial real estate side were seeing some great compression there also extended interest only periods on construction deals were seeing longer term fixed rates without swaps and without prepayment penalties again were maintaining discipline and were still winning and so to see the growth that we had in the first quarter with commercial line utilization down and were starting to see the secondary market refinancing start picking up but again i think our frame of mind has been very opportunistic and weve been out calling and i think other banks are starting to certainly pick up so competition is fierce but i like our chances we obviously built old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 the pipeline up quite a bit in the quarter we finished the first quarter really strong from the production and feel good about second quarter as well james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp scott this is jim i would also add that i think youre starting to see the fruits of all of our efforts regarding new hires start to impact us here and i can think of we were just in wisconsin and weve got some great new hires in wisconsin that are really starting to get some traction at ci space and as we continue to fill out the key markets new hires i think well continue to have opportunities to grow particularly as their noncompetes wear off and they can be active calling on their former clients in the marketplace so this is in a way were driving new businesses weve got incredibly focused effort jim and i are out calling regularly and were hiring new people to help augment some markets and some product classes we continue to want to grow r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect that all sounds great so thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott great to hear from you operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens your line is now open james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp morning terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc a quick question this last quarter just looking at the releases you kind of shifted from the allowance per loan losses to the allowance per credit losses and im just wondering do you have a reserve against securities or unfunded loan commitments just because the fourth quarter matches up with what was disclosed today and then could you just repeat again what the unfunded loan commitment expense was in the first quarter and maybe what that was last year old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp so terry the allowance for unfunded commitments is related to credit losses and obviously associated with any of those unfunded construction draws or revolvers and weve had that on the books for some time we ended the quarter million lower than we did last quarter and that really runs through our cecl models and the same drivers that drive our allowance for credit losses are the drivers that drive our allowance for employment payments terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for clearing that up and then jim just the last page of the investor deck your peer banks i just noticed two announced an moe last week another one included in a deal this morning i guess my question does what does that say about midsized banks and what does that say for old national james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp well i think it continues to be a difficult environment out there right i mean the operating environment is not getting any easier theres lots of competition theres lots of need to continue to invest in talent and technology and i think revenue growth can be challenging for our industry so i think all those things are driving those types of conversations as i have said previously were open to all those kinds any kind of transaction that will ultimately drive stakeholder value and well just have to think but anything in the moe space i think requires a higher bar right and you got to be really focused on culture strategy and fit in addition to the financials because if you cant get those things right then the financials wont come so obviously open anything that makes sense our board of directors would have to take a look at those things but a slightly higher bar terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks jim james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thank you operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys good morning jim maybe a question on capital you talked about the growth the movers and the drivers of the growth this quarter can you speak to your appetite for buybacks obviously i heard the comments old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 about a little bit cautious on the uncertainty with the economy but you guys have a ton of capital im just interested in buyback priority james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah definitely on the table for us to consider and were going to balance those out with nearterm outlook on any potential ma partnerships and well just go for the tradeoff clearly as the economy gets a more stable footing we get more comfortable i think they become more of a viable option but again i think well want to look at how we can better deploy capital whats the better use of capital a buyback or an ma partnership opportunity christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but i guess i shouldnt read into the lack of a buyback meaning proximity to a deal james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp no thats been our stance the entire year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe just on the reserve obviously your credit has been spectacular over cycles how do we think about just the absolute level of reserve today versus maybe fast forward a year when we fully emerge can you just remind us where the day one was and how youre thinking about that bogey brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris this is brendon yeah so we started day one season with million were at million today a big chunk of that difference in our model today is the qualitative reserve which were holding significantly more than we did at day just reflecting the uncertainty of the economy so that is that comparison that said were not sure what the economy would look like three quarters from now were comfortable with where the reserve stands today and well be flexible and move it up or down accordingly christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then if i could just sneak one other clarifying comment the nii stability was that excluding both ppp accretion or was that a gaap number old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp no core core yeah core indiscernible christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc core core brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp excluding ppp accretion christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right awesome thanks brendon operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning good morning a question for you brendon just on the expense guide to clarify that i see a consensus of about million for the year is that the number youre looking at or should we be looking at something else brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah im thinking jon that the second third and fourth quarter numbers are reflective of our expectations so give ourselves credit for the million fee relative to what the street had but yeah rough and tough thats pretty close jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc back on loan growth any differences in recovery expectations across the footprint and if you had to put your finger on what is really driving the full optimism what would that be james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp im going to start this off jon and then let jim jump in clearly i think weve demonstrated our willingness to be out seeing clients looking for opportunities and it was all driven by the comfort around our credit quality and our portfolios right we came in were known to be that relatively conservative lender so we came in feeling pretty old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 good about our portfolios we were quickly able to jump in and analyze the portfolios and confirm that we should continue to feel good about that so it didnt stop us where many of our peers took a pause there they took a pause for a couple of different reasons they took a pause because i think they were worried about their own portfolios but they also took a pause because they had people at home maybe not as proactive as our team members were and so we continue to do that places like michigan continue to have setbacks in terms of their covid numbers so that will probably put maybe a little bit of pressure at least on the psyche of some of those people up there and so well continue to watch that but i dont see a big change in our markets this is still a midwestfocused organization and they all seem to be recovering on equal basis but i do think it will various competitors will come back in various ways and as jim said weve seen it most acutely on the commercial real estate sector where that seem to come back in a pretty significant way but well continue to be active james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah the only thing i would add our clients and prospects were talking to certainly in the manufacturing space some on the ph contract and spending very very optimistic and the biggest challenge across the footprint is just finding skilled labor and thats the big thing thats holding people back and theres been some supply chain challenges as well but overall i mean its really an optimistic outlook and they continue to deal with those other challenges fairly well so optimistic jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good just two more followups slide the credit slide the nonperforming loans theyre coming down and theyre gradually coming down and im just curious if you could share with us the profile of what is npls and maybe the flows in and out in terms of what youre seeing there james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah jon let me start by saying whats interesting in this environment is there are still what i would consider maybe probably smaller banks than old national that are really aggressive in taking some of these clients and so through any cycle that has a big influence on our ability to manage nonperformers or move nonperformers out these kind of liquidity in the market whos taking these loans so we never i think maybe for a quarter maybe two quarters that slowed down a little bit but really not like indiscernible so thats the first ability for us to manage those on the nonperforming we had a little less than million in actual paydowns out of that portfolio so again to the extent that theyre able to find other banks that are doing that the profile on our nonperformers is really across the board we really dont have any industries that are concentrated in any of that really no ci versus cre it is just individual borrowers throughout that many different industries that have come on this list and i think as to jims comment earlier its just the way weve underwritten coming into the cycle james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 and jon you know our history here right where we tend to call them very early and i think if you look into the graph to the right in terms of what our chargeoff looks like relative that portfolio because were early to call them and really decide whether this is a credit that we think we can stick with or this is a credit that we think we need to work out i think that gives us an advantage when it comes to the actual loss of experience that we have with those individual borrowers and quite often were able to rehabilitate them and they go back in the book and we recapture that interest income that we didnt take all the time they were in that bucket but i think its just being proactive with those situations and trying to get as accurately as possible when we see weakness jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats interesting you look at that chart in the upper right on slide and when we look at it every quarter but when you really look at it its youre right on that its impressive and then i guess the last thing chris and terry asked around it as well but what is your appetite on ma excluding the moe piece of it because i agree thats a rifle shot and sticky situations on a lot of that but what is your appetite and what are you seeing in terms of deal flow and attractiveness of potential sellers james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah consistent with my previous comments on the quarter were not seeing a lot of books being passed around and those smaller opportunities and our appetite i think is back we were internally focused was the year of the pandemic and executing our onb way and i think now were in a position particularly as we get more comfortable with credit that we could be in a position and it doesnt mean that i wasnt active over those two year period of time i can tell you i was very active i still continue to do that a lot of that personally and so absolutely are in a position to if one comes along thats attractive that meets all of our hurdle rates we would absolutely take a look at it in this kind of environment particularly given our better ability to assess credit risk jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger with hovde group your line is open james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good to hear from you ben ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group thanks good morning guys solid quarter good start to the year i just wanted to follow up a little bit more hypothetically on credit now if you look over the past couple of recessions you see net chargeoffs peaked in and a bit of a bell curve manner about two or three quarters after the bottom from like a gdp perspective i guess you could say so this recession and recovery a bit different obviously because a lot of the stimulus and government programs intervening preventing a lot of aspects through deferrals so just thinking hypothetically its probably going to be a bit of a bell curve but elongated and less of a peak at the top so as you guys work old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 through this year and your qualitative factors comes holding it back do you need to see continued improvement or theres more time passing by before you feel more comfortable with that total allowance working back down to the below million james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp ben i think you characterized it really well i do think this recession is different probably it could be elongated maybe a lower peak and i think the time is whats going to tell that story and then in opening comments were going to be thoughtful about our approach to reserving over the course of the year given the uncertainty i think your comments were appropriate in how were thinking about it as well ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group okay thanks and then just thinking about loan growth in general a lot of the bigger banks you guys all alluded pulled back and then most recently come back into the quarter and some of the commentary at least from last week on the really big regional banks that seen as the second half of the year is going to be the area where you see actual growth being that you guys have seen core loan growth late last year and early this year do you feel as though that the competitive aspects are to prevent you from going at the pace that you were or is the markets going to be recovering like im just trying to figure out indiscernible core loan growth is it a driver of you taking share or you just knowing your customer because you are competing for slightly smaller customers or from a more nuanced dynamic is there areas within lending whether it be ci or cre that you feel as though you can indiscernible while the other people are still on the sidelines james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i would just add a little bit of both right i mean we are taking share were taking share because were just a little bit more nimble a little bit more focused were taking share because were hiring new people and then we know our customers pretty darn well customers pretty darn well and were out making sure that were meeting their needs and their demands and working with them and looking forward its really hard obviously thats why we tried to provide the pipeline perspective its really hard to look out two or three or four quarters out in terms of what growth might translate we feel really good about obviously we gave our pipeline numbers for the quarter in the accepted category that gives us more comfort its hard to know how competition ultimately going to change those pipeline numbers but what i will tell you this it wont stop our focus i wont stop our efforts were going to outhustle everybody around us were going to work really hard well continue to put attractive people on the team to go out and grow this business ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group and then finally my last question kind of looks at more of the fee income obviously mortgage is a bit out of your control given the national dynamics of it but are there any areas where you continue to see some outsized growth i know that wealth management had a good quarter service charges were downloaded but thats probably a day count factor any areas within fee income where youve been adding some talent that maybe the market isnt looking at it correctly old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp well im just saying the wealth management basis in the area we continue to grow and look for talent and fundamentally were changing our approach to that business were really focused on holistic financial planning and less focused on individual transactions to grow revenue and so i think those are probably as weve always said a little longer term play they dont translate into results but i think the quarter youre starting to see both we benefited from obviously a better market by and large but also continuing to hire people in that space continue to have a focus on that space ive never felt better about that business than i do today for us to continue to drive better than our historic run growth profile i think treasury management an area to that were also investing a lot in in terms of people and technology we feel really good about that business again thats a little longer playing its not as big an impact in the short run but over the longterm i feel better about our ability to grow that business ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group all right great i appreciate all the answers and solid quarter hope you guys keep it up and have a great year james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks ben operator operator instructions our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hi james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys hey just i dont want to make it put too fine a point on the ppp outlook but so most of what youve got left in fees is round just as we think about the cadence of things when most of the round forgiveness fees does that come in the second quarter and then how are you thinking about the round forgiveness in the second half of the year is that going to be lumpier and geared toward the fourth quarter or evenly split through the two quarters in the second half of the year and then at this point would you say i mean were pretty much done with originations in round in other words what we see is what we get and this is good days to go off of old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2021 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yes i would say a vast majority of the originations that we quoted brendon gave you the first quarter through the fourth quarter and then i quoted yeartodate the million thats more than likely the bulk of what were going to be doing for the year given the programs likely to run out of funds here very soon thats probably loaded towards the fourth quarter that round number is probably loaded towards the fourth quarter and lets just say of that number probably is collected this year its really hard to put a finer point on it than that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp but i think you otherwise accurately understand the situation r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay terrific all right thank you guys appreciate you taking the follow up james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator there are no further questions in queue at this time ill turn the call back over to jim ryan for closing comments james c ryan iii chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thank you so much we appreciate your participation one thing that i want to make sure we pointed you towards we just published our
