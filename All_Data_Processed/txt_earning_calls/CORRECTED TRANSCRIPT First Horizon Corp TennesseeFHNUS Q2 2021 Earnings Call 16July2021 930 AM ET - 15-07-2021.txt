everyone and thank you for joining our call im proud of the first horizon team as we continue to deliver solid performance the economy continues to strengthen loan demand and activity is continuing to build and our strong credit quality is performing well liquidity and cash levels are strong broadly in the economy which is leading the higher loan payoffs more competition for new lending opportunities and compressing loan spreads our diversified business model including mortgage banking mortgage warehouse lending and fhn financial continue to provide an effective offset to some of these headwinds we delivered adjusted eps of with a return on tangible common equity of in the quarter our capital levels remain healthy with a common equity tier ratio at and we grew tangible book value per share by in the quarter to our revenues this quarter were down from strong first quarter levels fhn financial and mortgage remain strong but also with extraordinarily strong first quarter levels first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 our results this quarter were bolstered by the impact of continued rapid improvement in the overall economy and asset quality which resulted in a provision credit of million were encouraged by the uptick in activity across franchise as markets and sectors reopened our associates are having lots of constructive dialogue with clients and prospects and we feel were at a relatively strong position to benefit from further economic improvement loan pipeline certainly continue to reflect the strengthening economy in may and june still near term the industry is confronting continued lower rates high levels of excess liquidity and very little incremental loan demand clients are still cautious about new investments and are still facing supply chain and labor force constraints that are problematic we are also starting to see ppp loan forgiveness pick up all of these translates to a fiercely competitive landscape for loan outstandings we are continuing to focus on controlling the things that we can control driving toward completing our merger integration capturing revenue synergies being good risk managers all while focusing on serving our clients and anticipating their needs we continue to do a great job of capturing revenue synergies across the markets and product lines by leveraging our expanding suite of products services and expertise all instrumental in retaining and growing our client relationships at the same time we are committed to continuing to drive enhanced efficiency by delivering million in cost savings and controlling cost while still making prudent investments in technology and products to drive future revenue growth we also continue to opportunistically deploy capital through share repurchases we bought back million shares this quarter including dividends we returned a total of million of capital through our common shareholders we continue to be optimistic about the path of the economic recovery and the increased activity levels we are seeing across our footprint as our markets continue to reopen but like many we are keeping a watchful eye on supply chain and labor constraints as well as signs of inflation i continue to be highly confident that our business model and benefits of the merger of equals position us well to deliver top quartile return over the medium term and now ill turn it over to bj for some comments on the results bj william c losch iii senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks bryan good morning everybody lets start off on slide as bryan mentioned were really pleased with the continued execution in the first half of the year the merger is delivering the enhanced efficiencies that we expected and were capturing the benefits of the merger savings and really starting to see the additional revenue synergies across the platform which we think will only ramp from here as bryan said we delivered gaap eps of or on an adjusted basis reflecting the resiliency of our balanced business model and exceptionally strong credit quality performance our results this quarter from a revenue and expense perspective were in line with expectations and as expected net interest income headwinds persist and we experienced continued strong fee income albeit lower than the outsized levels in the first quarter and we delivered continued improvement in expenses with an incremental million of mergerrelated cost saves first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 from a credit quality perspective the combination of the improving macro environment and our own asset quality including the benefit of upward grade migration in the loan portfolio exceeded expectations and drove a provision credit of million in the quarter with net recoveries i repeat net recoveries of million in fact for the first half of the year we have an aggregate net recovery of million on a billion loan portfolio outstanding performance we remain on track for our final systems conversion in the fall and continue to make progress towards our million net savings target with million of those annualized savings in the quarter at the same time were making nice progress on those revenue synergies i talked about briefly via crosssell and leveraging our balance sheet to serve the broader customer base we currently estimate that were on track for roughly million of annualized revenue synergies across various commercial and consumer businesses with more to come across all those platforms turning to slide ill quickly review the notable and mergerrelated items in the quarter as you can see we had million aftertax or a share of mergerrelated notable items and as you know in january we raised our expected net merger cost saves from million to million consisting of gross cost saves of million and reinvestment of million we continue to be confident in achieving these savings in addition were now expecting our pretax merger costs to total about million and this increase is largely driven by three components first is tied to more recent developments related to product and capability enhancements weve elected to make in connection with the integration so think of it as making the engine more durable and powerful while the car is on the lift so to speak as we prepare for our systems conversion secondly we are seeing postpandemic vendor and staffing constraints that have caused an increase in both the level and the cost of estimated man hours required to complete our technology integration and third as we finalized our decisions around accelerating our branch closures given the shift towards digital adoption we still have plans to close a total of branches but now expect to see a higher level of impairment cost given the ultimate mix of those branch closures that weve decided upon so we believe spending an incremental basis points of capital to position us far better for the future makes good longterm business sense and its important to note that the payback period on the increased cost saves and the addition of the revenue synergies were already seeing is still well in line with our original estimate of about two years slide provides an overview of our adjusted financials for the quarter we generated ppnr of million as expected revenues decreased from strong levels given expected reductions fixed income and mortgage banking fees along with continued nii pressure adjusted expense of million remained relatively stable in quarter as the benefit of our incremental merger cost saves was muted by some higher longterm incentive costs and this quarter the provision credit which we talked about at million is compared to million in the first and as we sit here today we see opportunity for more reserve releases in the future dependent of course upon several factors including further macroeconomic improvement low levels of net chargeoffs and positive grade migration the pace of macroeconomic improvement is likely to be less pronounced that it was in q2 but theres opportunity for further positive grade migration as updated financial statements will be received from borrowers over the next two quarters bottom line though we expect the net impact of all those factors to be positive with further reserve releases quite likely first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 and as bryan mentioned we grew tangible book value per share by a strong and generated an adjusted rotce of or before the impact of that provision credit very very strong performance moving to slide nii performed in line with expectations declining million linkedquarter on an fte basis both reported and core nim were down basis points linkedquarter driven by about basis points of impact tied to higher excess cash we ended the quarter with increasing levels of cash at about billion up from billion in the first quarter we did also see pressure from lower loan balances and given the competitive landscape experienced spread tightening on new originations compared to the runoff which collectively translated to about basis points on the nim given the change in rates and housing supply constraints our mortgage warehouse outstandings decreased and we saw increased pressure from premium amortization and lower libor in the face of these environmental pressures we are very very focused on controlling what we can control and our continued deposit pricing discipline is helping to mitigate the impact of those lower rates and overall muted loan demand interestbearing deposit costs of basis points in the quarter remained stable and were down basis points excluding purchase accounting and as we look forward we continue to believe were well positioned to benefit from an improving economy at quarterend our interest rate sensitivity or nii sensitivity to an up shock was about and about on a gradual basis moving to slide taking a look at fee income dynamics fixed income adr came in at million compared to the very strong first quarter of million reflecting continued favorable operating environment for the business given high levels of cash in the banking system and immediate loan demand mortgage banking and title fees came in at million compared with higher first quarter levels while fee income was lower in our mortgage banking business overall mortgage originations across our platform were very strong up quarteroverquarter with an intentional shift to onbalance sheet mortgages the lower mortgage fee income reflects the impacts of housing supply constraints lower gain on sale spreads and that intentional shift in origination mix towards the portfolio our focus here is on customeroriented relationships which we believe is a better alternative for adding interestearning assets as compared to securities purchases importantly given the overall economic momentum across our footprint we saw a million lift in card and digital banking fees with a benefit of an increase in transaction volumes and finally id note that youll see a million increase in other income which was driven by a nice million securities gain largely related to a legacy iberiabank equity investment slide taking a look at expenses adjusted expense was million and stable relative to the first quarter personnel expense decreased million linkedquarter driven by a million decline in incentives and commissions partially offset by increases in longterm revenue and performancebased incentives in occupancy and equipment we saw a million increase largely tied more to the equipment line which was related to some strategic software investments and finally increased activity levels given the reopening of markets post pandemic caused about a million increase in our outside services line slides and we take a look at our loan growth and our funding profile you can see their average loan balances were down about billion in the quarter with commercial down about million and consumer down about million commercial was impacted by about billion decrease in our loans to mortgage companies partially offset by a million increase in ppp balances first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 last quarter our mortgage warehouse volume was around refi and thats moderated in the second quarter to and as we look forward we do believe that some of our volumerelated strategies in that business will allow us to gain more share in mortgage warehouse lending with a net benefit to profitability and outside of ppp and mortgage warehouse we did see a lift in overall commercial balances which were hopeful will continue in the second half of the year as bryan mentioned we continue to be optimistic about the path of the economic recovery and the increased activity levels as markets continue to reopen quickly on the liability side we saw a continued inflow of deposits driven by billion average increase in non interestbearing deposits with commercial balances including benefits from the second round of ppp total deposit costs are at a very low basis points with interestbearing deposit costs at bps on asset quality starting with slide our overall credit quality continues to surprise to the upside we had net recoveries again of million or basis points down basis points from last quarter with nonperforming loans decreasing million given the large provision credit the allowance credit losses coverage ratio came in at basis points compared with last quarter driven by the continued improvement in the outlook positive grade migration those net recoveries and lower loan balances as you can see our overall loss absorption capacity excluding mortgage warehouse and ppp as well as the unrecognized discount on our acquired loans stands at a very healthy our credit quality is excellent and while all peers are experiencing low levels of net chargeoffs our performance is among the bestinclass and we expect that to continue turning to capital on slide as bryan mentioned cet1 ratio is at a healthy up about basis points or so in the quarter driven by growth in retained earnings and a reduction in riskweighted assets increase was partially offset by the capital return bryan talked about through repurchases and dividends we expect capital levels to remain strong with flexibility to both deploy and optimize our capital structure moving on to merger integration on slide its been a little more than a year since we closed our merger with iberiabank and we continue to make very good progress were focused on retaining and growing the client base with our expanded products and services as we talked about we achieved million in annualized run rate savings in early july you see we successfully converted virtualbank customers onto a new fully cloud based finxact core and in the coming months as we prepare for our fall core systems conversion we plan to complete our wealth trust and credit card conversions as well our first round of banking center consolidations and training for all associates on our new systems turning to our outlook on slide our results this quarter were in line with the outlook we provided you in april and were providing an outlook for both the third quarter and the full year of you can see in the third quarter we do expect nii to decrease modestly given the outlook for lower ppp and the impacts of continued low rates and reduced merger accretion while we anticipate relatively resilient results in our fixed income business we do expect fee income to be down in the lowdouble digits to lowteens range due to lower mortgage banking fees we expect noninterest expense to decrease in the low singledigit range as our ongoing focus on efficiency and merger costs saves comes through we expect chargeoffs to be in the range of to basis points and its reasonable to see continued reserve outflows we expect our cet1 to remain in the to range we now expect a midsingledigit decrease in noninterest income with net chargeoffs in the to basispoint first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 range and the cet1 and as bryan mentioned we feel good about the positioning and our ability to perform well given the current economic environment finally on slide we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities of our business model and franchise our fee income businesses are performing just as we would have expected were controlling expenses were driving down deposit costs were making good prudent longterm investments in talent and technology were seeing good business activity as markets reopen credit quality is excellent and we believe well continue to deliver attractive returns near term and in the future just a quick note as many of you know today is my 51st and final earnings call with first horizon in fact it is exactly years since my first earnings call on january that day we reported a loss of whereas today we report a positive result of its been quite a ride and i started here at a time when the company was arguably at its weakest and im proud to say confidently im leaving here when its at its strongest ive put my heart and soul into this place and its returned to me so much more than i could have ever given it and im forever grateful for that i want to thank bryan the board my executive team colleagues my finance accounting procurement properties groups and all my friends and colleagues at first horizon that have been an absolute pleasure to work with and finally thanks to the investor community for your support of our company ive enjoyed the performance accountability and intellectual challenge you provide to people fortunate enough to be in my seat i know i wasnt always right but i always tried to do the right thing and i hope you experienced that so with that ill turn it back over to bryan d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you bj im exceptionally proud of the teams continued execution and the results were delivering we are seeing activity levels pick up across our franchise and many of our specialty businesses were continuing to execute well on our merger integration while making prudent investments to position us well for the future our strong risk management posture is showcased by our asset quality metrics im grateful to our associates for their diligence around serving our customers and our communities and i continue to be confident in our continued progress towards becoming a top regional bank and our ability to drive longterm shareholder value and now before i open it up for questions ill also make a couple of comments about bj as bj just stated he did join us in in the midst of the financial crisis over the past years hes been a key leader in helping us reposition and position our business hes been critical to developing our strategies controlling our costs and many of the great accomplishments that weve had over the past years bj is a trusted friend and a partner i we will miss him while im disappointed to see him leave i fully support him in his new endeavors you will be missed so with that betsy well now take questions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions in the interest of time please limit yourselves to one question and one followup at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey jared susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just starting on the expense side with the additional million investment is there an opportunity to see that million ultimate cost save level increase from there or is that really more just the cost to get there has gone up and that we should that well probably see some additional negative operating leverage here in the next few quarters as that gets rolled in william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey jared its bj ill take that one as you know since youve known us for quite some time and followed us were never done with cost saves and expense efficiencies and so weve started at million were up to million and in an environment like what were operating in i think well continue to look for additional opportunities over time right now we are all laserfocused on getting to our conversion in the fall which is our most important hurdle the annualized million is expected to be out of the run rate by the first half of and between now and then well continue building on additional expense opportunities beyond that to continue to find more efficiencies in the expense line d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey jared this is bryan ill piggyback on bjs comments we feel very very good about our ability to hit the million and we think if anything theres very little of any downside to it and we think theres a potential upside as bj said we consistently look for opportunities to drive efficiency and i think the nature of the business is such that weve continually got to look for opportunities to reduce cost and changing our nonvalueadded areas and put that into areas that require future investment in technology and infrastructure so we continue to use all of our levers around expense control to make sure we position the business for the long term first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks and then as my as a followup maybe just on the mortgage side what ultimately do you think you could be retaining from that production as we go forward versus selling and i guess the impact of that on the gain on sale margin william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee so i think what youll see from us is a continued shift to on balance sheet portfolio originations i do expect that youll see net increases in originations maybe not as high as the that we had seen but the secondary volume that were seeing is still strong and were capturing many opportunities our clients have seen more opportunity in our portfolio originations particularly around 7year arms or a 15year fixed which weve seen quite a bit of interest in so i think youll see that continued shift with overall originations continuing to go up probably secondary continuing to moderate down and portfolio up in terms of gain on sale it is continuing to moderate and we expect that to continue to come down over the next few quarters jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and congratulations bj on your next steps its been great working with you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you you as well operator the next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hi jennifer susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hi jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 hi could you just talk about the revenue synergies youve seen today with iberia and whats been kind of better than expected and whats kind of lagged versus your expectations and where you see the biggest opportunities in the next months or so d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey jennifer this is bryan ill start we feel very very good about the trend on revenue synergies and i would say there are very few areas that were concerned about lagging at this point as you might expect theres some natural synergies that come from just being a larger organization larger hold positions but were seeing very very good momentum across specialty lines of businesses where either organization may not have had an opportunity in the past our equipment finance business our assetbased lending business our private client wealth management businesses some of those take a little longer to build the infrastructure around it but at the end of the day we feel very very good about the progress that were seeing were seeing opportunities continue to multiply and at this point we feel very very good that were on track to exceed the million that ive talked about in the past we think were in that million annualized area today in building momentum once we get through this integration we think it will pick up further momentum in the first and second quarters of next year jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay great and in terms of the loan loss reserve you said more releases are likely assuming these credit trends and economic trends continue could you see the reserve going lower than it was below the day one cecl level william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey jennifer its bj likely not i think day one cecl would have been around basis points for us i think on a combined basis so its hard for me to think about it going much lower than that it certainly could but i dont think that we would get there for a while but with that said if you exclude ppp and loans from mortgage companies which carry very very little weve got basis points or basis points from where were at today to get down to those levels so again we do believe that the macro environment will continue to improve credit quality is excellent the way weve managed both portfolios both legacy portfolios are really starting to shine now so we do believe theres very healthy reserve releases to come over the next several quarters d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee jennifer ill pick up on bjs last comment so susan doesnt have to do it a year ago as we got into the pandemic and not knowing how the economy was going to play out there was a lot of concern industrywide about how credit would play out and at that time we said we felt that our portfolios would do as well or better than most and albeit admittedly the fiscal policy in the country reduced losses across the industry we do believe very strongly that our portfolios both the legacy iberiabank portfolio and the first horizon portfolio and now the combined portfolio has performed in a very strong fashion and we believe while its top performance today we think that will continue given the way we approach credit and risk in the portfolio so im very very proud of the result i cant say that im a big fan of cecl and the reserve methodologies and but i do believe that we will migrate back down towards as day one levels as quickly as anybody and i think that we will continue to deliver that very strong and consistent credit performance as a result of our efforts to manage risk in appropriate way first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you look forward to continuing to work with you bj william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks jennifer operator the next question comes from brett rabatin with hovde group please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone and congrats bj on your new role william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brett d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning brett susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted just to talk about the liquidity on the balance sheet and if you think about the cash balances theyre now of average earning assets and with the guidance for that for the cash to continue to build obviously not a great environment for reinvesting cash and securities but just how do you intend if anything to maybe manage some of the liquidities you might do some securities purchases from here and just thinking about trying to manage obviously manage nii more than the margin but just thinking about the margin and possible ways to kind of offset the margin pressure william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah its bj so yeah were actively thinking about that and we are seeing accelerated levels of cash that were reinvesting in the securities portfolio in aggregate we have not materially increased it at this point were buying mostly agencies cmo mbs with a little bit of highquality municipal in it and we can modestly look at something there over time as well but were more focused on trying to create interestearning assets on the portfolio that have a customer relationship to it and going back to our earlier comments on mortgage originations and finding ways to give clients more opportunities from a portfolio usage perspective its likely where were going to go first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 weve also been a bit more active in owneroccupied commercial real estate on the commercial side and offering some attractive opportunities across our footprint there so a little bit more fixed rate type lending opportunities that were looking to try to build upon so i think were a little bit more focused there so i think fortunately or unfortunately i think its a highclass problem to have but i think well have these deposit excess cash balances for a while but to your point were much more focused on nii and i think were hopeful that the core nii is really bottoming out at this level and we see going forward opportunity for growth in the core nii so thats what were planning on and executing upon brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay i appreciate the color bj on that and then i guess the other thing i wanted to address was just the guidance around the noninterest income lowdouble digit to lowteens decrease can you talk maybe about the components of that what percentage of that might be fixed income versus other segments that arent fee income william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brett its bj again i think its going to be mostly on the mortgage side and again its related to some comments i made earlier around the secondary originations probably continuing to trend lower plus continued moderation in gain on sale fixed income we still expect to be relatively strong around the levels that were at maybe plus or minus where were at but its mostly on the mortgage side brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay but mostly on mortgage okay great appreciate all the color william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks brett operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess first just around loan growth bryan some of the comments you made around the headwinds be it inventory lack of inventory labor shortage et cetera how should we think about any chances of loan growth picking up meaningfully this year for the bank like do you see this being a third quarter event fourth quarter or most likely a first half event that you actually see net loan growth coming in in a meaningful way d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah so you use the term meaningful a couple of times some thats a term of art some of we try to avoid defining meaningful but were pretty optimistic about the back half of the year in terms of our loan pipelines as i mentioned and bj mentioned in his comments we saw loan pipelines building in may and june when we look across where we see those pipelines building its very broadbased its in our really highgrowth markets that are sort of a combination of iberia and first horizon markets like texas we see strength in louisiana the carolinas its very broadbased there and we also see very strong pipelines in in our specialty businesses particularly those specialty businesses like asset base lending franchise finance equipment finance which in many ways sort of lead our early signs of a strengthening economy so were encouraged by that the other specialty businesses are mortgage warehouse lending business our balances came down a bit this quarter we expect that that will strengthen in the third and in the fourth quarter given that the pipelines that we see there so we do see the signs of strengthening pipelines and loan growth on the converse side of that we believe based on what we know that theres still going to be a relatively high level of payoffs paydown in certain sectors particularly real estateoriented sectors for example where refinance activity taking stuff into the capital markets or using significant liquidity is reducing the outstanding but on the whole we feel good about were positioned with broad markets we feel well positioned with the pipelines that we see the specialty businesses that we have and to the extent that there is growth in the overall economy thats driving loan growth we think were going to get our fair share and maybe more susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee one thing i would add to that is as you know we were a big participant in the ppp program at both legacy banks and while that obviously the ppp is contributing to runoff weve got really good feedback across our markets in some of our specialty areas about the ability and were working on all these to pick up additional business where we were able to service both clients and prospects and help them with ppp when their potentially their existing bank could not and what were seeing is that could really be an additional benefit for us later this year and into as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just as a followup you talked about revenue synergies in particular bryan if you could address when we think about the mortgage business and the capital markets business where do you see the greatest first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 synergies now that you had one year since the deal closed from the merger and how quickly do you think you can start monetizing on those opportunities in terms of its impact on revenue growth d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah so if you take the mortgage business as an example our team indiscernible and his team have done a really good job of taking the mortgage products weve integrated our systems were rolling out the expanded capability across the first horizon footprint and i would say that over years if we developed a bad habit that bad habit would be we didnt really indiscernible first horizon legacy footprint view the mortgage as a critical part of the consumer banking relationship simply because we were outsourced on the delivery of that product now that weve got it insource were seeing tremendous momentum pick up as people are leveraging that muscle again to really ask for the mortgage and build out that capability and as bj alluded to in his comments a few minutes ago were seeing our bankers originate more mortgages for customers and a lot of that is going on to the balance sheet so im optimistic that our fhn business will continue to see opportunities to grow weve added debt capital markets capabilities in our fixed income business which were seeing significant momentum building over the last two or three quarters so im optimistic that on the revenue synergy side that the goals we set which i think based on capital bank integration were relatively modest and will lead to significant revenue growth down the road ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks and bj congratulations on the move awesome move thank you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks ebrahim d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks ebrahim operator the next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning just wanted to go back on again getting some more color on green shoots in the loan business i know you touched on this already but from the perspective of kind of using the new systems to drive new business will we see some examples of that in the third and fourth quarter or will that kind of implementation post conversion kind of be seen more next year d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 yeah from the systems perspective youll see that principally next year were implementing the incentive system for example which is a complete rollout across the entire organization iberiabank used that were putting in a new installation that momentum and the technology drivers of speed will really start to show up in the fourth quarter and in the first and second quarters of next year christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and then as you think about the continual buildout of the digital bank and what you talked about with finxact will you do kind of more sort of public announcements on that and or even have more visible examples of sort of additional cost saves kind of beyond what youve already pledged on the million im just sort of curious if well see some signs of that as you continue to go forward d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah anthony is on the line anthony you want to take that one anthony j restel a chief operating officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee sure bryan so chris what ill tell you is certainly we are a big believer in technology being able to drive overall efficiency for the corporation as we move forward so i think the simple answer to your question is our expectation would be as we continue to invest in technology and then you overlay kind of the ill call it the shifting preference of our customer base we should be able to drive more efficiency and leverage the technology moving forward so i think youll see that kind of bleed in continuously as we kind of cross the conversion period into next year and then hopefully continue thereafter christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great anthony thanks for the color i appreciate it and bj best of luck to you as well william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee indiscernible operator the next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q

thoughts on the outlook for the margin from here i know you saw the impact of the liquidity drive a portion of the 16basispoint compression this quarter so wanted to see how you think about the nim progression and then also i know you mentioned competition a couple times and pressure on loan spreads can you give us a little bit of color there like for example where some of your new money loan yields are coming in at this point thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure its a slippery slope trying to forecast the margin at this point right weve just seen continued buildup of excess cash here and across the industry and with trillion infrastructure program and more child tax credit payments come in i mean i think that buildup is going to continue so thats why we were more focused obviously on nii and we do think that the core nii for us is bottoming out for a couple of different reasons one is we still think that theres opportunity to move deposit costs down modestly weve got some exception price deposits that are still at higher levels than we would want and well continue to move those down we do expect that were going to start to see a pickup in loan demand as markets reopen so thats going to add to our nii so we are optimistic that were going to see some there in terms of what kind of loan yields were seeing right now from a commercial perspective were seeing new loan yields in the regional bank just over with average durations in the fiveyear range our specialty businesses are probably a little bit lower than that maybe with slightly lower durations so those yields are probably to basis points lower than our portfolio yields across those portfolios right now so there is yield compression and margin compression out there across the industry john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah and then secondly on the capital front just want to get updated thoughts on your cet1 target i know your internal target is about to and i know you mentioned some audio gap optimize your capital structure any consideration around the potential reduction audio gap first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah john for some reason you were breaking up a bit but i think you were asking about cet1 target and that were a little bit above where weve said to we are were not uncomfortable seeing it move up or down a little bit around those areas as we pointed out a couple of different ways we have been using capital to repatriate shareholders through our stock repurchase program we have plenty of capacity available in that and we will continue to be opportunistic and we think that todays valuations are very attractive visàvis a longterm value we are as you know and one of the great legacies that bj will leave is the bonefish and our drive towards capital efficiency and we focus very much on excess capital in the organization and dont believe letting it build up and being deployed for bad uses is a good thing and that well use excess capital to repatriate to our shareholders so at the end of the day we still believe in that to we think given some of the signs of opportunistic growth we will absorb it between growth organic growth and our share repurchase programs john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks bryan d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee sure thing operator the next question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc actually i just want to go back to the net into the net interest income guidance just a little bit if i take your third quarter guidance and sort of put it in with kind of with the actual numbers in the first half it still feels actually numerically it looks like your net interest income has to decline in and then it also has to decline even further in to get to your fullyear guidance so sort of that midsingledigit decline im using as sort of that midpoint but it just feels like thats a bit contradictory to your more optimistic outlook around i think bj just mentioned your core nii is stable because you expect to pick up in loan demand presumably you mean in the second half but its just unclear and i was hoping you can clarify all that thank you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 hey ken thanks yeah its bj so weve still had a healthy amount of ppp accretion weve still had a very healthy amount of loan accretion from the marks on the iberia loans and if you look at kind of the walk forward that we have for you on the nii page you can kind of see that the moderation in our total nii is coming down so while we do expect that core nii will continue to strengthen and increase its likely to be more than offset by lower loan accretion and less ppp benefits than we have had in the first half of the year so thats really the dynamic that is going on there on our outlook slide we gave you total nii outlook but thats the underlying dynamics as to why it looks the way it does ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay no that is helpful and just to go back to a prior question on loan growth in the back half of the year i think bryan when you mentioned when you were answering the question it feels like you spoke a lot about pipelines and because i just want to make sure that you said youre optimistic about pipelines improving but as we all know pipeline and balances are sort of two different things are you also and just to be clear on this but are you also optimistic that loan balances actually improve in the back half of the year or is it just pipelines thank you d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah ken again i spoke about pipelines but i also spoke about the outlook for payoffs and theres a significant liquidity and the short answer is were optimistic about loan growth i think in our mortgage warehouse business and others we should see some growth but its in this part of the cycle with a significant amount of liquidity in the markets its hard to know what payoffs might be and so that is the sort of the toggle factor that we just dont know so our outlook is optimistic but we dont control what we dont control which is payoffs the ppp balances are clearly going to come down with forgiveness et cetera so depending on what part is a little bit like the net interest margin question that you asked bj it really depends on what line or what sector of the line item youre looking at but i think on the core business were reasonably optimistic about our ability to grow if we can retain the balances thats set out every day susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee and ken we did if you looking at may and june in terms of new commitment production now granted to your point it doesnt necessarily translate into the balances yet but very strong new commitment production in both may and june and really across the many of the areas that bryan mentioned in the earlier question it was the number of our specialty areas abl equipment finance franchise finance health care and then the regional banks alabama texas louisiana east tennessee north carolinas et cetera so i know the credit teams are busy working with the line on looking at these opportunities to increase both for existing clients but also opportunities that we have with prospects so the activity level has definitely picked up ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you operator the next question comes from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey thanks for taking my question just wanted to go back to capital you guys have used a little bit of your buy back here i think you got around million left just with the stock coming in here along with all bank stocks seemingly in the past couple weeks would you expect to be a little bit more active on the repurchase front as we move into the back half of the year thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey michael this is bryan were always opportunistic and as i said a minute or so ago i think were attractively valued at these levels visàvis the longterm value that well create visàvis peers the strong momentum that i think we see in our business coming out of this integration so yeah sure well pick our spots but well be opportunistic and use the authorization to repurchase shares to manage our capital levels particularly our excess capital levels in the organization michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks and then maybe just as a followup to go back to the fee income outlook it does imply seemingly another decent stepdown in fourth quarter and i guess my question is you said earlier that a lot of that has to do with mortgage but obviously has probably to do with some fixed income headwinds to just of really high levels but that said i mean do you think fourth quarter will be the trough and do you think you can actually grow fee income as you move into next year thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah hey its bj michael and yeah i actually am happy you brought that up because one thing i forgot to mention when i was talking about that stepdown was dont forget that we had about million or so of securities gains in this quarter which is kind of a part of the adjusted baseline if you will so obviously those security gains on the legacy iberia investment and another smaller one arent going to reoccur so thats part of the stepdown then the majority of the rest of it is related to mortgage and like i said fixed income continues to remain strong with all the excess cash in the system and what i said earlier was were at million i think to put a fine point on it and so being somewhere around that range plus or minus is likely where it will be at least over the next quarter if not through the rest of the year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator the next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey everybody william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey steve susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning steve d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i know that overall deposit levels continue to rise for the industry right just given stimulus and other factors but im curious when you guys look at your typical bid market customer and your markets are they starting to draw down deposits to fund investments or are their deposit balances still also rising d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee like any generalization itll be wrong but for the most part their balances are still rising theres still a fair amount of cautiousness around new investments and to pick an example fiscal policy and what a capital gains rates look like what the tax rate corporate tax rates look like what does a return on investment all of those things are still affecting peoples psychology about making investments this isnt an anecdote but we had an equipment lease that was actually repaid with cash in spite of prepaid penalties et cetera so people are taking cash and theyre being fairly cautious with it and reducing debt and putting it on the sidelines until they get a little bit more clarity about where the economy and the pandemic are headed and things like bluntly where we end up from a monetary and more importantly maybe a fiscal policy as we work through this period of uncertainty around corporate tax rates et cetera steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah but bryan regarding the optimism around loan growth resuming in the second half all right are the your customers signaling they plan to draw on credit lines despite that theyre still sitting on excess liquidity themselves d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah the credit line utilization hasnt changed it might just sort of hang in there at that area and we see customers its a mixed bag we see some customers that are looking at things or theyre booking new commitments and theyre indicating that theyre going to draw on these commitments and others that are being first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 more cautious about it so it is one of the things where i guess everybody us included has a little bit fuzzy crystal ball about how things are going to play out if you spun back months ago or months ago or even months ago we wouldnt have been able to predict how things have played out with a whole lot of certainty and i think we look at the next six months and say that there are a lot of things in motion and on the whole what we see in terms of building pipelines what we see in terms of customer acquisition and callin efforts were more optimistic than not but there is still a certain amount of uncertainty there is a fair amount of uncertainty steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for that and then for my followup question with the 10year trending lower despite the firming inflation data the milliondollar question everybody has is outside of central banks who is exactly purchasing treasuries here and you guys have a very unique vantage point into this right adr is very strong again in the quarter so maybe could you give us some color on what types of investors you guys see in your fixed income business actively buying treasuries here and is it banks thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey steve its bj yeah its interesting what i think our fixed income people would tell us is that its actually predominantly the largest us banks so we havent really seen any material change in how theyre holding liquidity so they are the ones that are buying up a lot of the treasuries were seeing a little bit of purchasing from japan and europe but predominantly its being driven by the largest us banks which is interesting dynamic steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats great color and congratulations bj well talk to you soon thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator the next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so the mortgage warehouse was down i think a little more than people had expected linkedquarter was down about which is kind of a big move i know that has been very robust over the last year or so with covid and everything but maybe just talk about the warehouse from here do you expect it to recover at all is this or is this a good level or could we see maybe some additional weakness as mortgage continues to cool down d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah brady this is bryan as we sit here today were optimistic well see some recovery in those balances over the next couple of quarters there are a lot of things going on in the mortgage space right now some of it is just a constraint around housing supply and the inability for new purchase money transactions to actually occur refinance activity has leveled off its going to ebb and flow given the years that steve just pointed out but given some tweaks that weve been making which we think will allow us to pick up additional market share of our existing customer base or warehouse share of our existing customer base were expecting that balances will probably drift up over the next couple of quarters brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats good to hear and then my second question is just on ppp fees i think you guys had about million of them this quarter which is a high watermark so far just remind us whats the level of ppp fees that are left and any thoughts on the timing of that realization william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brady its bj at the end of the second quarter we have about million left and we think that that will continue to come down probably over the next months or so brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great well bj great working with you and good luck at live oak william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks brady operator the next question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking the question if we could just go back to mortgage business in terms of the gain on sale and the gain on sale trajectory how should we think about that i hear you its lower but should we look at that as lower for the duration that overall mortgage volume may be falling or is this do you see this as more of a shorterterm adjustment deep driven by competition in the market first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey brock this is bryan ill start i tend to think that the gain on sale spreads are probably not going to expand as much pricing was the leverage to slow down volumes and periods of peak volume where everybody was having trouble meeting demand and at that volume particularly refinanced activities ph subsided id be surprised if gain on sale mortgage has expanded back out as in our income statement particularly in the fee income line its really a function of two things the level of secondary sales and two the gain on sale percentages indiscernible you made some real simplifying assumptions and said okay we booked probably million or so into our portfolio that might otherwise have been sold in the secondary markets and assume that they were sold at the same gain on sale spread which i know were overly simplifying and thats probably million of pretax earnings that comes back to us through enhanced yield over time so were looking at volumes and spreads and thinking about how it was the right mix of balance sheet known balance sheet and we asked and answered earlier in the call about duration and expanding the size of our securities and using excess cash we clearly want to use our balance sheet to support customer activity and where that is is driven through duration and mortgage product well look at it but on the whole we think as you summarized earlier you have the directionally mortgage gains will likely be down and that spreads in our view are not going to expand out significantly from here brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and just going back to your earlier comment on mortgage my understanding was that that is still primarily that the iberia part of the franchise and that once you knit together the systems then you can introduce it on legacy fhn side is that accurate or has that already happened d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee its and i would say that its inaccurate in the sense that we have that product available across the broader franchise it is accurate in the sense that we are not practiced at originating the kinds of volumes we think we can originate out of the first horizon franchise so we believe that we have much more capacity in the legacy first horizon franchise because we have trained ourselves to not be in that business and have sort of indirect fulfillment model given the direct fulfillment model and the success were seeing with that we think that we will see much greater mortgage volume out of the legacy first horizon franchise over time brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah sure brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 and good luck there bj d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks brock operator the next question is from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i wanted to circle back on capital so the cet1 ratio youre taking that up about bps im just curious why i mean you sound like youre going to be pretty opportunistic on the buyback just curious why youre taking up the capital floor when you feel good about credit and just some color there william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah casey i wouldnt necessarily say were taking up the capital for it were just giving you kind of our view of where capital is likely to be you know as bryan alluded to well be opportunistic on share repurchases and that well use some capital wisely rwa growth is going to continue to be muted and so the combination of those two will for a today were giving you a range of to if we start to see some rwa and loan growth coupled with some share repurchases it floats to the lower end and conversely if we dont it goes towards to the higher end but i think bryans point earlier was ultimately were more comfortable from a balance sheet perspective and a capital optimization perspective more in the range but just given kind of the dynamics of the environment today well likely be more in the to casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay okay got it and then on the ma front obviously a pretty active environment still could you just give us some updated thoughts on first horizons appetite today d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2021 yeah i dont think very much has changed from our perspective were still very very focused on getting our integration completed and then really following that delivering on what we think are the huge opportunities that exist in our existing franchise with the significant growth markets that we have the opportunity to serve at our 12th state footprint our combined banking footprint and what we think are the opportunities to just grow organically so we dont were not thinking that ma is critical to our strategy its not built into our strategy our strategy is designed around lets execute in a very seamless and thoughtful way for our customers delivering the breadth of best products and technology to capitalize on the huge growth opportunities that we have in our footprint and invest organically and then if something comes up along the way we will certainly consider it but at the end of the day its not something that were taking our eye off the ball in terms of execution today were really focused on delivering the promise of the iberiabankfirst horizon merger of equals casey haire q analyst jefferies llc excellent bj its been a pleasure miss you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp
