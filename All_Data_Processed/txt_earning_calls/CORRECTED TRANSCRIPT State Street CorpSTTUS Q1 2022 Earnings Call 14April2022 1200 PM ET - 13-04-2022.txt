over to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you ilene and good afternoon everyone earlier today we released our first quarter financial results before i review our results i would like to briefly reflect on the operating environment in the first quarter which included both significant geopolitical events as well as notable macroeconomic developments and market movements turning to slide three of our presentation first i would like to acknowledge the ongoing events in europe following russias invasion of ukraine in march i traveled to crack out to visit some of state streets approximately employees in poland during my visit i was moved by the selflessness of our colleagues in poland well continue to support displaced ukrainian people in a number of important ways from opening their own homes and providing shelter to offering professional support such as interpretation services while state streets direct exposure to russia and ukraine is very small our teams are responding fluidly to the situation and delivering for our affected clients and other stakeholders with dedication and professionalism in what state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 continues to be a stressful time we have wellestablished and regularly tested business continuity plans designed to continue critical services for our clients and support for our people the first quarter also saw dramatic market movements driven partially by the conflict in ukraine plus a broader set of macroeconomic forces a tight labor market rising energy prices continued supply chain disruptions and the ongoing effects of significant covidrelated fiscal stimulus has contributed to inflation reaching multidecade highs as a result in march we saw the first interest rate hike from the federal reserve since late a substantial upward move in longend interest rates as well as volatile currency and equity markets and a stronger us dollar each of these factors in part shaped state streets financial results in the first quarter which i will now discuss before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail starting with our financial performance first quarter eps increased yearoveryear and was up excluding notable items with earnings growth supported by both higher total fee revenue and stronger net interest income leading to an improved yearoveryear total revenue performance in the first quarter within fee revenue our global markets franchise performed particularly well driven by higher fx market volatility and while state streets revenue performance improved we also remain highly focused on controlling the expense base notwithstanding continued new investments in our business and operational capabilities first quarter total expenses were flat yearoveryear and increased just excluding notable items supported by ongoing productivity efforts and the stronger us dollar taken together we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as pretax margin expansion good earnings growth and higher return on equity relative to the year ago period turning to our business momentum which you can see across the middle of the slide we recorded another quarter of solid new auca asset servicing wins which amounted to billion in the first quarter while auca won but not yet installed amounted to trillion at quarter end front office software and data also experienced good business momentum with annual recurring revenue for the first quarter increasing yearoveryear to million at global advisors assets under management totaled trillion at quarter end importantly we saw another quarter of solid net inflows of billion despite the volatile market environment in the first quarter our etf business continued to perform well as we further focused on innovation and enhancing our etf product offering for example in january global advisors launched three new esgoriented spdr etfs across small cap international and emerging market equities aimed at helping investors incorporate esg considerations into their portfolios in february global advisors expanded its fixed income offering with the debut of the actively managed spdr blackstone high income etf as we continue to innovate in the active etf category which accounted for of us net industry flows in the first quarter at state street digital we announced a number of exciting developments in march we entered into a licensing agreement with copperco a provider of institutional digital asset custody and trading infrastructure we intend to leverage coppercos technology to develop an institutional grade digital custody offering where clients can store and settle their digital assets within a secure environment operated by state street state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 turning to capital our ratios remained healthy although cet1 declined quarter over quarter largely due to lower aoci driven by the significant moves in interest rates in the coming quarters we remain focused on maintaining strong capital ratios regarding bbh the regulatory review process for the proposed acquisition of the bbh investor services business has progressed more slowly than we anticipated while many required approvals have been obtained some required regulatory approvals most notably approvals of the relevant federal banking agencies remain outstanding we are evaluating potential modifications to the transaction that are intended to facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review we are working towards concluding regulatory reviews during the third quarter while we are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the relevant federal banking agencies there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of their regulatory review both parties state street and bbh continue to be excited about the overall financial and strategic opportunities of combining bbh investor services with our business we are continuing to work closely with the bbh team on pre integration planning this includes all the preparatory work in product operations technology as well as employee communication and client planning we still expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in the first year post closing to conclude my opening remarks the first quarter was defined by both unexpected significant geopolitical events and notable macroeconomic and market developments in the face of which state street delivered an improved yearoveryear financial performance and solid business momentum metrics while supporting our clients and colleagues as we look ahead in this environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility we remain laserfocused on delivering what is within our control including excellence of strategic execution across the front middle and back office maintaining the recent improvement in our sales effectiveness and expense discipline all while continuing to provide valuable insights and promote better outcomes for the owners and managers of the world capital and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good afternoon everyone ill begin my review of our first quarter results on slide four we reported eps of or excluding acquisition and restructuring costs on the left panel of this slide you can see we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth with strength in many of our businesses notwithstanding the macroeconomic environment at the same time we held total expenses roughly flat yearonyear as we continue to both invest in the franchise and control expenses as a result we generated positive operating leverage of about percentage points in the quarter and continued to improve our pretax margin yearoveryear all things considered this was another strong quarterly performance demonstrating the progress we are making as we continue to improve our operating model and drive growth state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 turning to slide five we saw periodend auca increased by yearonyear and decreased quarteron quarter the yearonyear change was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels client flows and net new business growth the quarteronquarter decline was largely the result of lower period end market levels in both equity and bond markets similarly at global advisors aum increased yearonyear but declined sequentially relative to the period a year ago the increase was also driven by higher period end market levels coupled with strong net inflows across all three of our franchises our etf institutional and cash businesses the sequential decline was primarily driven by lower market levels which was partially offset by strong net inflows of billion in the quarter turning to slide six before i start i would like to remind you that we are expanding our servicing fee revenue disclosures by disaggregating the line into backoffice servicing fees and middle office services with that on the left side of the page youll see first quarter total servicing fees were flat yearonyear as higher client activity inflows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and a currency translation headwind we continue to see good growth in both our insurance and official institutions client segments sequentially total servicing fees were down primarily as a result of the seasonal pricing headwinds and lower average equity market levels partially offset by strong client activity within servicing fees back office fees were flat both yearonyear and quarteronquarter largely driven by the factors i just described middle office servicing was down yearonyear and quarteronquarter primarily due to a partial transition from a legacy client and lower professional services fees in the quarter notwithstanding the decline in the quarter middle office is an important component of our alpha proposition when it comes to both the front office when it connects to both the front and back office and we expect to see good growth over the medium term as evidenced by our uninstalled revenue backlog which ill talk more about in a moment in terms of business momentum im pleased with how has started as we report another quarter of solid new auca wins of billion while auca won but yet to be installed amounted to trillion at quarter end we continue to be happy with our pipeline and im also particularly pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of strategically important premium and preferred clients turning to slide first quarter management fees were million up yearonyear primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and strong etf inflows management fees were down quarteronquarter largely due to equity market headwinds partially offset by the tailwind of lower fee waivers and net inflows of note our management fee performance for the quarter was supported by strong net inflows of billion with positive inflows across our entire business franchise institutional cash and etf with respect to money market fee waivers the fee waiver impact to management fees for the quarter was roughly million down from about million in the fourth quarter i would note that following the basis point fed hike we saw in march of this year we no longer expect money market fee waivers to be a headwind to management fees starting in april as you can see on the bottom of the slide our franchise remains well positioned for growth i am particularly pleased that the strategic actions that weve previously taken in our long term institutional and etf franchises are now helping to draw inflows even in the current volatile market environment state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 on slide you can see that fx trading services had yet another strong quarter relative to the period a year ago fx trading services revenue was up yearonyear and quarteronquarter both the yearonyear and quarteronquarter performance benefited from high fx market volatility while higher client fx volumes also contributed sequentially part of the revenue uptick has come from about billion in higher riskweighted assets we put to work this quarter which demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and which ill come back to in a moment our securities finance revenues decreased yearonyear primarily driven by lower average agency assets ph on loan partially offset by solid new business wins in enhanced custody sequentially revenues were down mainly reflecting lower average agency and enhanced custody balances due to the declining market levels and fewer specials first quarter software and processing fees were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter largely driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with crd which ill turn to shortly finally other fee revenue of million almost doubled yearonyear and quarteronquarter mainly reflecting fair value adjustments on equity investments moving to slide weve provided a breakdown of our consolidated front office software and data revenue on the left weve broken down the revenue into software categories you have seen us use before onpremise professional services and softwareenabled revenue while crd represents a large majority of this line alpha data services alpha data platform and mercatus revenues are also included here as well as weve highlighted earlier front office software revenue growth was particularly strong up yearonyear primarily driven by onpremise renewals as well as the continued strong growth in softwareenabled and professional services revenues on the right of the slide weve provided some key growth metrics enabled by crd and alpha as i mentioned earlier during todays presentation youll notice that weve broken out both the front office and middle office uninstalled revenue backlog both of which are key components of our alpha proposition going forward the front office backlog of million is up and the middle office backlog has more than tripled yearonyear to million the backlogs reflect expected annualized revenue which can be compared to the million of annual revenue base in across both the front and middle office businesses and is an indicator of future revenue growth once fully installed the alpha pipeline remains promising despite the current geopolitical environment as clients realize the transformational benefits to their technology and operations infrastructure turning to slide as we see the start of another rate tightening cycle first quarter nii increased yearon year primarily driven by growth in our investment portfolio coupled with higher loan balances which will also benefit us in future quarters relative to the fourth quarter nii was up which came in better than expected due to higher longend rates the sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and longend rates which benefited our yields together with higher investment portfolio balances state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 on the right of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter which has been relatively steady average assets were down quarteronquarter largely driven by seasonally lower deposit balances which are down slightly from the seasonally high fourth quarter but up yearonyear turning to slide first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased yearonyear or adjusted for currency translation productivity savings and targeted investments ph remain on try for the first quarter as we generated approximately million in yearonyear gross savings and selffunded most of the strategic investments weve been making in the businesses including technology infrastructure broader automation alpha and state street digital compared to first quarter on a line item basis excluding notable items compensation and employee benefits was down as lower head count in highcost locations and the tailwind of currency translation was partially offset by higher seasonal expenses information systems and communication expenses were up due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency occupancy was down due to footprint optimization and lower maintenance costs and other expenses were up primarily reflecting higher professional fees relative to the fourth quarter expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal expenses partially offset by productivity and footprint optimization savings headcount increased slightly quarteronquarter as we began to in source some technology functions from vendors and growth in alpha overall we remain focused on delivering positive total and fee operating leverage and have demonstrated that this quarter amidst the current macroeconomic environment moving to slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio decreased by percentage points quarteronquarter to due to both numerator and denominator effects rwa increased by roughly billion or basis points of cet1 during the first quarter of compared to yearend driven by three factors a modest rebound from an unusually low fourth quarter a strategic and temporary allocation of additional rwa capital to our markets businesses to generate the higher than expected first quarter revenues that we just discussed and lastly the rwa impact from the saccr implementation that started on january of this year which we had planned for at the same time our capital base was also impacted by the substantial reduction in aoci of about billion worth basis points of cet1 relative to the fourth quarter as we saw a significant and historic quarteron quarter movement in longend rates particularly in the belly of the curve for instance the rise in the fiveyear us treasury of roughly basis points was the largest in the last years taken together the increase in rwa coupled with a meaningful reduction in aoci partially offset by about basis points of earnings accretion net of dividends drove the decrease in our cet1 ratio this quarter in contrast first quarter tier leverage was down only slightly to mainly driven by the substantial decrease in aoci reflecting a significant change in the interest rate environment and a stable balance sheet while capital return remains an explicit priority for us and we recognize its important to our shareholders given this billion move in aoci related to higher interest rates we no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second or third quarter as we operate with a conservative balance sheet philosophy state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 given the volatility in rates and the possibility of further significant increases we are in the process of taking several actions to reduce aoci risk by about half this primarily includes shifting additional afs securities to htm as well as shortening the portfolio duration through swaps lowering extension risk and consciously allowing some portfolio runoff some of these latter actions can be reversed in the future when we choose to reinvest at higher rates turning to slide we provide a summary of our first quarter results despite the continued volatile market environment im pleased with our financial performance which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our businesses total fee revenue was up yearonyear primarily driven by higher management fees fx trading software and processing fees and other fee revenues expenses were well controlled and were held roughly flat yearonyear demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model next i would like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter outlook and some of our economic assumptions as we look out over the year at a macro level while we know that rate assumptions have been moving our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards which suggests a yearend fed funds rate of in terms of second quarter of we expect overall fee revenue to be down about on a sequential basis with servicing fees up about and management fees up to assuming equity markets remain flat to march 31st levels for and some downward normalization in fx trading revenues in terms of some of our newer fee revenue line items that we started to disclose this quarter we would not expect to see a repeat of the size of onpremise renewals in the front office software line nor the positive equity investment markups in the other revenue line in regarding nii we now expect nii to increase to sequentially which will be driven by the expected fed rate hikes partially offset by the aoci mitigating portfolio actions that i outlined earlier for full year we now expect to see yearonyear nii growth of around to depending on fed actions and rate moves as well as the shape of our portfolio turning to expenses we remain laserfocused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs we expect that second quarter expenses ex notable items will be up around to on a sequential quarter basis excluding notable items and seasonal compensation of expenses of million on taxes we expect that the tax rate will be around we continue to expect to deliver on our goals of margin expansion and positive total and fee operating leverage for the year and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you eric and operator we can now open it up to questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we have our first question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey eric just a followup on all things related to the rate environment just wondering first of all on the commentary about considering some alternatives with regards to the brown brothers deal can you elaborate what that might mean is that potentially some type of thing you might have to fix on the capital side or is that related to just timing and deal structure any help there would be appreciated eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp ken its eric no capital from a capital perspective were quite comfortable with closing weve got almost capital ratios today weve got a very i think smooth path to being prepared for a close from a capital perspective the modifications were talking about are just around the underlying structure of the transaction and youve seen this done from time to time before but were working through legal entity and subsidiary structure the exact transfer of systems and thirdparty contracts some of the translation and servicing agreements those kind of structure and modifications that we think will make this a cleaner process and be favorable on several fronts ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and then is there any updated thoughts about general zone of what you might think about for potential closing eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp as ron had said the regulatory review process has taken a bit longer weve obviously been heavily engaged in that process because of some of the modifications that were working through jointly with brown brothers leadership team were deeply in the process of getting additional and refined submissions in those will take several months for review and further dialogue i think you have a sense for how this plays out and thats why in the prepared remarks i think ron described that we expect those reviews to come through during the third quarter i think at that point we obviously then sprint to a close and depending on exactly what month and what week those come through then we look for you take out the calendar you look at the weekends and do the usual how do we now just close but weve got to always close carefully just given the usual financials and controls that you want to be mindful of ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and just i guess ill ask a starter one on nii and then leave it to others but just can you do you know just the impact related to the restructuring type of actions versus what you might have thought for nii state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp theres a range of that i think youve seen us guide to nii up for the quarter of up to and that on a year onyear basis is actually going to be quite nice i think its is it worth a percentage point two or three its those kinds of i think adjustments that were willing to make so that we both run an appropriate portfolio in what could be a highly volatile rate environment including another possibility of rates could move another basis points or basis points and we want to have a portfolio that can withstand that and to be honest were willing to take a few percentage points of nii growth off the table on a sequential basis to do that so i think its a balance but thats the range and even with some of those adjustments a lot of what well be doing is in the move from afs to htm which is not nii impacting there are others on the margin that are but thats kind of the range that id share it with you ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks eric operator your next question is from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there so the sec wants to implement t1 by the end of next year i saw the comment letters including yours my personal opinion is nobody is ready for it in the industry so im curious why the move from t2 to i am sorry t3 to t2 was kind of easy and t2 to t1 everybody seems to be pushing back is it the complexity and shorter time horizon is it the money to spend on the technology its just a little weird to me ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes glenn its ron why dont i take that i mean i think that if you look back in history everybody has resisted these moves to some degree because it does involve some spending of money and changing in systems of all that weve spent a fair amount of time on this and thought about this and have been in conversations with regulators and it will be an added burden but we dont think its something the industry can get done in a reasonable amount of time so im not i havent read other peoples comment letters i know how weve thought about it so we think it will be one of these things like a libor if you will more recent history that will take a lot of time take a lot of effort but its certainly not something thats going to in our mind sideline us or sideline other major players glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay appreciate that im good thanks operator our next question is from brennan hawken with ubs state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon thanks for taking my questions just a sort of a clarification here the expense guide eric that was plus to quarteroverquarter and but were supposed to ex out the seasonality right so do we back out what exactly is the right base that were supposed to do we need to take the million and then back out the million and then grow that eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp let me just open up the slide so i think youre doing it brennan in line with how weve described it yes you can take the first on slide of the slide deck that billion of expenses that includes the seasonal expenses which are on the footnote right of million you can pull that out and then you can add to sequentially and get an estimate for second quarter thats correct brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay thank you for clarifying that and then thinking about the deposits what when you were talking about the decline in deposits you flagged normal seasonality which would suggest that there wasnt anything thats unusual that youve been seeing but weve started to see rates back up in the market the policy hikes weve already seen one policy hike likely to see quite a pace here in the next few meetings how is dialog with your customers what are your expectations updated expectations around deposit action and do you have any kind of estimate about where you might think you could see deposit growth or runoff end up shaking out here in the at least next quarter or two eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure brennan for the time being weve seen little movement in deposits other than a little bit of seasonality a little bit of currency translation has also played through but this is all within the bounds of what wed expect and weve obviously been watching deposits carefully across currency pools and across client segments and for the time being its been its just been flattish regardless of which way we look at it as we go forward we like many others have tried to guesstimate and i use the word guesstimate not estimate the level of shift in deposits movement of deposits that well see with the amount of quantitative tightening that the fed has announced and i guess the best context i have for you and others is if we go back to the kind of pre covid era weve grown our deposit base since then by billion to billion weve also increased our aucas by about during that time period and because of those correlate we estimate that about half of the increase so billion to billion has come from the quantitative easing as the fed expanded the fed and the other central banks primarily the fed expanded its balance sheet by effectively trillion and so we see that reversing over time with the rough math being for every trillion of fed balance sheet wed expect billion to billion run off in our deposits and if they start in the they start in may or june well see exactly when they get going at their announced pace you could see a little trickle down we think in the fourth quarter and then the kind of the billion to billion per year after that so thats our guesstimate were obviously flush with deposits and were happy to be flush with deposits as rates rise so well monetize them for the time being but thats our guesstimate right now the other factors are how the interest rate hikes play out we expect betas to be similar but theyre never exactly the same as they are before state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 and so well be sharply focused there so those are some of the moving parts and some of our thinking at this point brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that color eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure operator our next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc last year you announced state street digital and i wanted to get a sense as to how thats going relative to expectations what youve been able to execute on there and what your clients are asking you to do more of ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes theyve had a lot going on betsy maybe ill focus on that last question first because this is a very client intensive vision ph and staying a lot of quantitative to think the single bigger thing clients are asking for is help with a kind of a comprehensive regulatory framework this is particularly acute in the us both lack of guidance and lack of really an agreed upon framework has left a lot of uncertainty into what institutions can do particularly banks so thats out there i think most of it though beyond that betsy would be around and where were spending a lot of time is firstly around enabling clients to invest in digital assets and thats not just the trading of them but its the movement of them its the control of them its the custodying of them its the portfolio accounting of them so its really if you think about what we do now for digital assets tokens coins et cetera i think the other very large thing that the group is focused on which is less about external products and much more about how does state street itself move into a digitalized world more than it is already and what does it mean for the core operations such as custody securities movement and control which is really about for lack of a better term the next stage of digitalization state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 we are working a lot with the major players in the industry because these ecosystems are forming and in some cases we actually want to be a very integral part of the ecosystem in other cases we actually want to access that so theres quite a bit going on there is where i would summarize my answer to you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and would you say that yeah go ahead thanks eric eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp betsy its eric i was just going to add the other thing were doing is obviously where clients especially institutional clients have added crypto holdings within their fund right were effectively providing some of the services youd expect and so weve gone through theres across our client base they have about funds i think at last count with billion of crypto exposure were effectively record keeping those assets as part of their underlying funds and then i think more broadly where clients are developing specific etfs and exchange traded products right thats where we are in an industrious way signing them up for the administration and record keeping because that in a way is our view as one of the next land grabs because as etf and etp products that comes of age thats where well see some significant inflows betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and would you say youre at scale for these offerings or theres more investment to do to get to scale ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp i think where we are now is of adequate scale but one would expect that more scale will be required but as much excitement as there is around this its still a relatively small proportion of total investment assets so i think were at adequate scale i think the focus now is more on how do we think about additional capabilities when betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yep now i totally get that but as cbdcs come through its going to be critical to have this infrastructure ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah agree with that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc with central bank digital right with central bank digital currencies all right thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks betsy state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 operator our next question is from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great good afternoon folks just back to bbh just on that timing of closing one more time i guess potentially could move into the fourth quarter is it safe to say that you think this would certainly close before yearend and is there any risk to it it not closing under without changing the terms dramatically and is it mostly the us regulatory side as opposed to nonus ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah i mean brian the regulatory environment is uncertain probably gotten more so over the last couple of years than less so but we are making progress it is taking longer than we anticipated were in dialog so its not like theres were not doing anything or theres silence on all this were in a fair amount of dialog and working the kind of the restructuring that we referred to earlier is explicitly aimed at trying to accelerate this that we view speed is of the essence here but theres a fair amount of uncertainty so as i said in my prepared remarks and eric just reiterated what were targeting at this point and assuming that therell be a this review will get done in the third quarter and then as eric noted the actual once the review is done the close itself isnt going to take a lot of time i mean everything is ready the money is in place theres been a fair amount of integration planning but it really is around the uncertainty of both the timing and the outcome of these regulatory reviews and yes its mostly right now the open ones are mostly the us banking regulators weve received lots of approvals from around the world both from financial services regulators and the antitrust regulators globally so i dont want to minimize whats been done but this is one of those things thats basically not done until the last one is done brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah that makes sense thats great color and then just on the maybe on the deposit side again so obviously bbh gave you pretty good capability to bring on incremental deposits and i know its getting pushed out a little bit but maybe eric if you want to just if you can sort of update us on your thoughts or just reconfirm your original thoughts about the level of bbh deposits that would be coming on if it were to close today for example and then your appetite for bringing more deposits on i think it was up to billion of additional deposits at some point maybe just talk about how youre thinking about that if theres any change in that thought process other than the delay and is the core bbh fundamentals right now i assume at least on the interest side those are probably tracking better given the additional fed hikes since the last guide eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 brian its eric weve been pleased as weve been monitoring and working closely with brown brothers on the business the business performance it had a good finish last year its had a performance in the first quarter thats within the bands that we had expected and obviously theres a little bit of nii tailwind in there offset by a little bit of equity market downtick but its a business thats performing well we continue to be excited about it and the partners the nine partners that have been operating that business that are coming over to us are doing a fine job as wed expect which is really nice to see in terms of the deposits and the close and the assets and the modifications and the broader questions youre asking about the underlying economics of the transaction im not going to go into detail on that at this point i think ron in his prepared remarks affirmed that the economics are sound that theyll be accretive within the first year and what id tell you is as we work through the modifications which is oftentimes a legal entity kind of structure where we in the finance and treasury side are working very closely with our legal colleagues to navigate those modifications and make sure that they preserve the economic and the accretion that were looking for and so we continue to be positive and we think it will be positive for shareholders brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great fair enough thank you so much operator our next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good afternoon ron good afternoon eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric can you share with us i think you in your comments when you were talking about the cet1 ratio that you used the temporary allocation of additional rwa to capture some markets business had generated some better revenues for you in the quarter can you elaborate on that and if you pull back does that mean in the second quarter the rwa capital that was allocated would decline meaning that the all other things being equal your cet1 ratio could bump up a little bit eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric thats the those are the kinds of scenarios and ill say navigation that we do for our capital ratios and they are sometimes dependent on market opportunities whether its the fx trading desk here in the us or abroad whether its the sec finance unit or sometimes even the lending unit there were in close partnership with them around on one hand they are sophisticated operating within their limits and sometimes state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 they come by and we have real i think constructive commercial discussions about hey if theres a little more capacity at the top of the house can that be put to use and thats where we were this quarter and you saw we had quite a nice uptick in fx trading revenues up quarteronquarter which i think had not been anticipated was facilitated as we gave them larger limits partly because were sitting on an abundance of capital right now i think what you will see is that well do that selectively well probably do that for another couple of months well see how were feeling towards june we would like to keep our rwa asset levels at or below where we are today so we do expect them to be within those boundaries and so well selectively work through it but part of the discipline here is we also want to make sure that theres real incremental revenue that we can bring to bear if were going to deploy any incremental capital and that was the scenario this quarter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good very helpful and then eric i know its not a giant number but you touched on it in the outlook regarding the adjustments and the fair value adjustments to equity investments were up so strong in q1 q1 versus both the fourth quarter and the year ago quarter how big of a portfolio is that and was it private equity investments can you maybe give us a little more color there eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure gerard these are primarily almost exclusively minority investment opportunities and investments that weve made in a series of companies over the years theres to of them that are in the crypto space sometimes providing software sometimes providing infrastructure sometimes providing different capabilities there are some in the more classic technology areas where weve invested over time again in minority positions that help facilitate some ai capabilities and capacities that have helped us with our automation and engineering efforts and so theres a group of them but were primarily were not trying to build an investment portfolio what we have as investments typically of million million maybe million in early to midstage companies oftentimes they are companies that are providing a utility type service for multiple large banks so were in there with these sometimes the other gsibs or an international bank or what have you and so we get effectively they get the entity gets a network effect for multiple banks and we participate because we get upside in some of the services so were doing it to help facilitate primarily either revenue growth automation capability or just general capabilities to build up our product set and i guess the knockon benefit of that is because we know this market space well these tend to appreciate over time and its one of the ways weve been driving i think innovation would probably be the broader word to use and weve made some i think this particular quarter we saw a couple of these really appreciate which is good to see operator thank you and our next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities sorry i was on mute there for a second just eric any you updated the guidance on nii for the full year any change to the expense or fee revenue guidance that you gave in the prior quarter for the full year state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp jim i didnt go that far partly because the market environment has just been volatile whether its equity markets whether its rate hikes and so theres a number of drivers that are moving around i think nii we felt just because the fed forecast were so explicit between the dot plots and the new consensus that we should just describe that for all of you but the other lines we think its still early to go through its early to really call what the equity markets will do both in the us and internationally where theyve been more depressed well obviously navigate and adjust our expenses to some extent as we go through the year i think what we did do as part of the outlook commentary after i finished the quarterly description was affirmed that were committed to both positive total operating leverage and positive fee operating leverage and so i think that gives you some boundaries that were working within james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right maybe just one curious question on securities finance i appreciate the balances were down specials were down and those are important factors but ive always thought that spreads on sec lending were kind of the spread between you benefited from a steepening at the short end of the curve didnt really seem to see any of that benefit in the spreads is that to come or were just not thinking about that right how should i think about securities lending spreads excluding specials and volume eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think directionally youre right it tends to have some correlation and i think what we find though is that the specials activity and the mix of the underlying mix of assets that are being borrowed or lend tend to be a little more dominant in terms of their effects on the pl in a given quarter so that has a piece to the rate environment but tends to be the volumes and the mix that dominates james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay great thanks eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure operator our next question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good afternoon thanks for the question maybe just taking a step back for a second and when you sort of think through the capital or mitigating factors and the steps you guys have taken to sharp the capital position here ahead of bbh closing when you think on a multiyear basis and maybe sort of lessons learned from the move in interest rates and effect that had on your guidance capital position this quarter and maybe after what is the more appropriate mix of kind of cash securities and loans for us to think about over time as well as just the duration of the securities portfolio how much of that will look different perhaps as we look forward state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp eric eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp yeah alex its a good question in a way weve not been in this environment for or years right where rates either are going to move quickly to the upside or maybe move quickly to the upside and stay high either i think there are a couple of thoughts that weve developed over time i think the first is that the more we can add lending assets classic loans to our balance sheet they have to be high quality but the more we can add lending to the mix of the asset side of the balance sheet the better off we are and youve seen us consistently grow our lending book its off of a small base so thats an area well continue to evolve in i think given that that will though take some time the other elements here is what kind of investment portfolio do you run we just because of our trust and custody heritage believe it should be a highquality pristine one that is unassailable and our perspective as we do that is i think were more comfortable putting more of that over time into htm just because its an accounting convention that while you all can read through in our 10ks and qs what the underlying market is doesnt immediately or doesnt affect the capital ratios the one governor on that and youd say well why not put it all in htm and put it in the drawer is that in a down rate environment which typically happens when the fed moves into intervene on a recession you tend to get an appreciation of securities and you want to be able to monetize or take advantage of that to offset whether its credit or reserve bill and so thats one of the reasons why you dont want to put all of it in htm and the other reason is if rates are flattish or moving within a band of basis points here basis points there the afs convention allows you to rebalance to adjust your position a little shorter a little longer and thats beneficial and i think over time we found that thats been additive to our nii and pl and so i think over time youll probably see us put more in htm but not there are some limits to that but thats some of the ways were thinking about it and then i guess theres a last layer which is whats the composition and i think youve seen us adjust the mix of treasuries mbs cmos because were such a global bank the foreign sovereigns especially as euro and international rates rise i think well over time become a bigger part of what we do supro so theres a bit of i think the mix the composition will evolve as well over time alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right thats helpful thanks and then maybe a little bit more of a tactical nearterm question when we look through the nii guide just extrapolating the full year from the second quarter i guess no surprisingly the benefits of subsequent rate hikes seem to have a smaller effect on nii but curious how you guys are thinking about deposit beta assumptions beyond sort of the first basis points maybe looking at the uk market as kind of lessons learned theyre a little bit further ahead of us i guess on indiscernible in terms of both pricing and client behavior thanks eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 yeah i think the first basis points i think are little bit easier to read to your point like the first rate hike beta as we generally assume are in the range so thats the first one or two so thats comfortable and pleasing i guess i should say once you get to the third and fourth youre now floating up in betas in the to range and this is where it kind of depends and then i think once you get past the first four or five hikes you are looking at sequential quarter betas in the range i think youre just thats just what happens and to be honest we want to go back to a position where the nii is healthy the nii can support the preferred security stack that we should run from a capital perspective but we also want to be fair and thoughtful with our clients and the embedded sharing thats been a partnership here for decades and decades with them so thats what were looking at and thinking you never know how the speed of rate hikes effects that some of thats been taken into account in some of those guesstimates ive given you but i use the word again guesstimates here not estimates because we think these cycles arent perfectly comparable and some amount of quantitative tightening been factored into some of our thinking here as well but that will have an effect and then i think the last one that well have to see is depending on how the macro economy does whether its if the economy if rates move up another basis points basis points basis points and the macro economy is strong then theres a lot of demand for lending and so theres this bidask between deposits to fund loans if you have a slowdown in the kind of real economy then theres not as much lending thats going to be done and thats more beneficial to deposit rates so thats another feature that were keeping a close eye on alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks very much helpful eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp yes operator our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so eric i was hoping to ask a multipart question on the capital impact of bbh and how that maybe informs the buyback cadence from here so as we think about the pro forma impact to your capital ratios if we were to assume the deal closes in the next quarter or two and we shut off the buyback through the third quarter given the large pro forma capital hit i believe its about billion from goodwill and deal intangibles so about bps of tier leverage your ratio exiting would still shake out below your lower bound of not meaningfully below but somewhere close to i just wanted to confirm if the billion capital drawdown from bbh all in is the right level for us to be contemplating for modeling purposes and as we think about the buyback cadence if youre still running at or below that lower bound how quickly should we think about you getting returning to normal course payout target of roughly state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp yes i think the its probably a little bit easier to think about it in cet1 terms but the translation is kind of the cet1 divided by two gives you the leverage and remember on leverage especially in these economic times we certainly want to stay within the target range of to but ive been on record saying getting closer to as long as you stay in the leverage is quite comfortable given that its not a risksensitive measure if you then pivot back to cet1 were at almost relative to the target range of to so there is an almost basis point spread there of excess capital that we have if you then fast forward and lets say its weve had a discussion on this call is exactly what we should assume but if we were to assume a third quarter close for example the way to think about it is the goodwill and intangibles for the brown brothers transaction is about billion i think if you translate that into cet1 its just below the basis point mark so the comparison is we would prefer its not absolutely required but we prefer to have about basis points of capital to close it weve got about basis points today and then the logical way you think about how do you get from here to there over the next two quarters is actually pretty straightforward right on one hand we accrete capital net of the dividends thats worth about basis points a quarter so you got basis points there and on the other hand as we talked about earlier weve been deploying our excess capital through the rwa lines right through the riskweighted assets and we can easily rein in riskweighted assets by billion or more which creates another basis points basis points basis points of capital as part of a closing process so theres good levers here and thats why i said earlier from a capital perspective its a comfortable closing process and plan steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color eric thanks for taking my question eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure operator our next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks i just want to make sure i understood what you said on the call so on the one hand youre still guiding for positive operating leverage for you still expect a higher pretax margin your backlogs are up so thats all good i guess just to clarify your answer just now the brown brothers acquisition all else equal reduces your cet1 ratio by how much in basis points eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp just shy of just around basis points mike state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so youre at now so if you close the deal now youd be below the low end of your target so are you delaying the deal because of lack of capital or i didnt understand why the delay in the deal eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp it has nothing to do with capital if we had been in a position to close it now we would not have deployed billion maybe even billion of rwa and we would have had a comfortable close of the deal its not about capital its about as we described earlier the underlying regulatory process just taking more time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as it relates to the lack of resumption of buybacks is that solely due to the timing of the closing of the deal eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp its i guess were just factoring it in right were because of where we are on the regulatory process were estimating a potential third quarter close and to just navigate comfortably with capital because we had that large aoci hit of billion and i usually buyback million almost million of shares per quarter right that would be my usual cadence that aoci hit has effectively put us in a position where its best not to do those two quarters worth of buybacks during the second and third quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thats clear and then lastly your guidance for positive operating leverage how much does fee waivers contribute to that is that like all of it or or or just roughly eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp well the guidance is to have positive total operating leverage and fee operating leverage i think if i just try to do the math quickly but the ir team can probably help you offline mike this quarter we had fee waiver impact of million and then we wont have any fee waivers for the rest of the year last year we had fee waivers i can only remember the second half of the year because im trying to remember when it started in the million per quarter range so on our total fees of billion i dont know rough estimate maybe about point of fee operating leverage is caused by the tailwind absence of money market fee waivers but thats im doing mental math without even a pencil and paper in front of me so maybe we could followup with you offline but maybe in that order of magnitude at least mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i think i have i mean so in terms of zip code most of it does not relate to the fee waivers theres the lions share of it so i think i got it state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp thats correct its real underlying momentum yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you operator and our next question is from rob wildhack with autonomous robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research hi guys thanks for taking the question just on fee revenue in the quarter how would you describe about organic growth there ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yes i mean rob why dont i start its ron i mean weve had several now good organic growth quarters both on the servicing line and the management fee line i think that if you think about last year there was in the servicing line a fair amount of that would have been in alpha fronttoback a lot of that now is being installed and a big chunk of that is what you see in the trillion the growth that or at least the sales that we reported on the servicing fee line were kind of disproportionately in the traditional back office business which is highly scaled and relatively quick to install so we like that mix and then management fee have been as eric noted its been across the board in the core businesses its etfs institutional and a little bit of cash so we like both the level of it i mean always like more but we like the level of it but as importantly we like the diversity of it robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and then on the trillion to be installed can you just remind us of the time line for when that gets installed and when it starts to hit revenue eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure rob its eric weve said that that begins to get installed remember the bulk of that there were two very large deals that were announced in second and third quarter last year those were trillion plus deals and then theres obviously a set of kind of smaller and midsized activities for those two large deals they are complex and theyre transformational right for those clients and what were delivering and so those weve said tend to take a little longer theyre closer to the i think weve said for installations installations range from kind of months to months but for those were the middle ground is probably months to months so right now our estimate is that a good piece but probably not the majority begins to get installed by late this year and then this is really a lift of revenues state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thank you eric w aboaf a executive vice president chief financial officer state street corp sure operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn it back to our ceo ron ohanley for closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp well thanks very much thank you all for joining us i know it was a busy day for you so we appreciate your time
