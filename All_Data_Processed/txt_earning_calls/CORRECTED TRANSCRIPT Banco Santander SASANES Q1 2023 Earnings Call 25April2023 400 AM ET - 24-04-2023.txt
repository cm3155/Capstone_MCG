nps through the mobile channel since the app was released our efforts to become a fully customercentric bank are allowing us to grow the number of customers loans deposits and transactions for active

growing strongly we have progressed with the migration of santander payments in spain to our payments hub platform and already manages a significant part of the payments in europe merchant acquiring expanded its innovative valueadded services which is reflected in yearonyear growth in total payment volumes auto revenue fell affected by new lending and the performance of our leasing business in scusa as well as the negative sensitivity to interest rates we have recently announced an agreement with stellantis in europe to become its key financing partner with first to increase the outstanding portfolio by to billion by at the same time we continue to leverage relationships with oems importers and mobility providers to grow our businesses in north and south america we further strengthened our balance sheet and capital position our level of risk profile remains mediumlow and is proving to be predictable based on our diversification cost of risk stood at provisions continued to normalize yearonyear as expected llps performed well in the quarter as provision dropped mainly driven by south america and north america at the same time we delivered strong capital generation our cet1 ratio reached after having absorbed the full impacts from the second share buyback program and the extraordinary banking tax in spain josé will provide more details in a moment we will continue to leverage our transformation plan to deliver increased profitability and shareholder value creation and profitability as i mentioned earlier our rote closed at up basis points in the quarter if we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in spain rote would have been around earnings per share grew to higher than the quarterly average supported by strong profit growth and lower number of shares following the buyback programs additionally in the quarter we delivered growth in shareholder value creation as a result of our disciplined capital allocation and share buybacks at current share prices buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our shareholders we completed last friday the second share buyback program having repurchased around of our outstanding shares in the last two years which provides a return on investment of approximately to our shareholders these results demonstrate that santander has a strong model and risk management capabilities that work very well even in the toughest environments josé will go now into more detail on the groups performance in please josé josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor and good morning everyone following our sales presentation i will go into more detail on the groups pl risk profile and capital performance starting with the income statement i will explain the account line by line in the following slides but let me make a few initial comments as it has been mentioned we had some oneoff results in the quarter related to the reversal of tax liabilities in brazil for million million in nii and million in tax recovery and two provisions made to strengthen the balance sheet totaling million which net of taxes is million so these movements had no impact on profit and we have decided to net them in the lines of the underlying pl and ratios to facilitate comparisons with previous quarters and to better understand the underlying business dynamics to frame them against the yearend guidelines we gave at the investor day banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 additionally the pl includes the extraordinary banking tax in spain which did have an impact on attributable profit on the righthand side you can see the upward trend in profit quarteronquarter if we exclude the banking tax which was driven by top line growth going into detail on the main lines and starting with the quarterly trends in constant euros we maintain our strong revenue improvement in the first quarter revenue was higher than in the fourth quarter of billion higher than in the first quarter of boosted particularly by nii which increased billion but also by fees almost million more we have the balance sheet with very positive sensitivity to interest rates mainly in europe which coupled with healthy volume growth and an active margin management led to strong nii improvement in the last few quarters therefore the first quarter was a solid quarter despite lower day count and seasonal factors in the americas we had good fee income growth supported by valuedadded products and the network effect trading gains a small portion of our total revenue rose driven by customer base cib transactions and here its important to take into account that of our cib revenue is customer driven and finally other income increased as the fourth quarter was affected by the deposit guarantee fund contribution group nii rose yearonyear supported by volumes interest rate increases and moneys management margin management as i just said in terms of volumes loans were up yearonyear with doubledigit growth in dcb and south america north america rose and europe was stable with falls in spain and portugal mainly driven by prepayments of mortgages to individuals overall loans grew backed by consumer and mortgages likewise deposits increased with europe growing and south america north america and dcb growing around i will go into more detail on our loan and deposit structure later interest rate hikes mainly benefited europe mexico and the corporate centre the latter driven by higher liquidity buffer remuneration on the other hand brazil was impacted by a change in mix towards lower risk products and chile and dcb were affected by the negative sensitivity to interest rates group net interest margin improved from to as we continued to actively manage our margins we are very disciplined managing the cost of deposits and the repricing of loans after the market movements at the beginning of the year our deposit betas are on track with the numbers provided at the investor day so we expect this positive nii performance to continue in turning to net fee income it rose yearonyear reaching more than billion which is explained by more customers and more transactionality with them in retail banking cib which stood out with a growth in all regions but especially in europe very positive trends in pagonxt and cards and in wealth management insurance we had a good performance in private banking and insurance and volumes in asset management recovered in the first quarter with a net new money of billion finally in auto volumes growth across the board continued however fee income in europe was affected by the new insurance regulation in germany the evolution of fees reflects the improvements we make to our model to be more capital light moving on to costs the first thing to highlight is that despite inflationary pressures costs continued to increase below the rate of inflation this was the case mainly in europe where costs in spain the uk and portugal fell banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 around to in real terms as salaries in poland and latin america tend to be more directly linked to changes in inflation our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at having improved both yearonyear and quarteron quarter outstanding performance in europe improving its efficiency ratio by percentage points yearonyear we will continue to deliver on our cost and efficiency targets as we expect to further reduce our cost per customer and as a result continue to improve the net operating income per customer as héctor just explained credit quality remains robust and the cost of risk is well under control loan loss provisions grew yearonyear driving the cost of risk to converge towards the throughthecycle average as expected the main changes by countries were the following improvement in the cost of risk in spain and mexico credit normalization in the us from the very low levels we saw in and in but the behavior in the first quarter was much better than we thought poland increased its loan loss provisions impacted by higher swiss franc mortgage provisions and finally in brazil we had higher loan loss provisions yearonyear on the back of individual consumer lending as well as overall portfolio growth on a quarterly basis loan loss provisions fell and the threemonth cost of risk in the quarter was this performance was supported by the high quality of our portfolio the nonperforming loan ratio continued to improve falling to from in march the main improvements came in spain and dcb in part due to portfolio sales in the period and as well as mexico the portfolio distribution by stages remained stable on the righthand side there is a brief overview of our loan portfolio structure around of loans are mostly concentrated in mature markets and if we look at the segments our mortgages have lowaverage loantovalues the consumer lending portfolio is wellcollateralized short term and has high returns and the sme and corporate portfolio is wellcovered as well as over has guarantees finally high weight of our corporate investment banking portfolio is investment grade finally let me comment briefly on our exposure to commercial real estate which is controlled and diversified across countries our exposure to cre is of total groups drawn and committed exposure this is concentrated in the us the uk and spain accounting for of the total over half corresponds to social housing in the uk and multifamily in the us the npl ratio is below the groups total npl ratio in the us we have a total of billion of total drawn and committed exposure with an average loantovalue of between to office cre is just billion and it has an occupancy rate of compared with around for the sector as a whole let me also go into more detail in brazil and the us two countries that have raised some questions in the past quarters in brazil the brazilian economy has been performing well in recent years and interest rate hikes were implemented promptly and decisively to contain inflation growth in early stages this environment accelerated the credit cycle and increased cost of risk in from now on we expect interest rates to remain stable and probably start to come down after the summer additionally during the last few years we have been working on improving our portfolio mix in order to structurally reduce our cost of risk we have enhanced our customer profile the weight of new vintages with the best ratings has increased we have been more selective in new business to increase our exposure to lower risk secure portfolios like mortgages agro or payroll all in all given our risk management the enhanced portfolio mix and banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 new lending profile we expect to remain on target excluding oneoffs in cost of risk should remain stable compared to regarding the us despite the bumpy start of the year in the country the messages we gave at investor day have not changed we expect normalization of the cost of risk to continue throughout but remain below pre pandemic levels we actually had a better start of the year than initially anticipated in terms of credit quality which was supported by a stable used car prices and better latestage delinquency payments our focus in auto at the moment is on quality and profitability over volumes moreover we were able to further increase the share of auto loans funded by deposits we have demonstrated that our conservative structural risk management and solid liquidity place us in a very strong position to face very challenging scenarios at the end of the quarter our liquidity buffer comprising high quality liquid assets exceeded billion of which were level one assets twothirds of this liquidity buffer is in cash which is equivalent to of our deposit base our liquidity is strong and stable with ratios well above regulatory requirements the group lcr remained in line with yearend at and the nsfr around the alco portfolio represents of total assets which is below industry average the duration of the availableforsale portfolio is very low and the current marktomarket of the whole heldtocollect portfolio would have an impact equivalent to only of our fullyloaded cet1 capital this demonstrates that impact from the change of the value for bond portfolio and capital would be very limited even in a very adverse scenario customer deposits are our primary source of funding and are mainly based on sticky retail deposits in our core markets these diversified and stable funding structure supported yearonyear growth as deposits rose with positive performances across almost all countries and segments the quarteronquarter decline in deposit balances is explained by the seasonal drop in cib clients deposits while retail remained stable in the quarter some customers using savings to prepay mortgages given the rising interest rates in europe and we have seen some flows from current accounts time deposits and mutual funds we have not seen any unusual deposit movements in recent weeks following the ph troubles with banks in the us and europe in fact we actually saw net inflows in the group in deposits in february and march of over billion regarding capital we ended the quarter at let me give you some color about the variations in the quarter basis points of organic growth which was basically driven by the strong profit generation in the quarter partially offset by riskweighted asset growth this includes a negative 4basispoint impact due to the extraordinary banking tax in spain basis points drop from shareholder remuneration which includes the total impact of the second share buyback program basis points and the accrual of the cash dividend basis points for the first quarter taking into account a payout basis points were related to the update of the regulatory framework mainly following the ebas clarification of its interpretation of cet1 minority interest calculation and finally a positive basis points from markets basically available for sale so we have increased our fullyloaded capital ratio while delivering on our capital productivity targets as you can see on the righthand side of the slide improved front book rorwa to continued asset rotation and increase the percentage of risk weighted assets which deliver returns above the cost of equity all in all a disciplined capital allocation which combined with our model gives us confidence in the sustainability of our commitment to remuneration to our shareholders now i will hand it back to our ceo for the conclusions thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 héctor grisi checa chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you josé to conclude the presentation and open the qa i will briefly outline some final remarks ph of our vision for the coming quarters growth in customer volumes robust revenue performance double digit nii growth driven by positive sensitivity to rising rates in most countries and customer margin management fee income grew at highsingledigits driven by our cib payments and payment businesses we expect this trend to continue in the coming quarters mainly in europe and mexico we are implementing our one transformation plan our aim is to serve our customers more efficiently and faster process automation and simplification supporting our efficiency improvements we will accelerate one transformation further in the coming quarters we have already identified business opportunities across the group which will enable us to maintain strong global network businesses revenue finally we have a solid balance sheet in terms of liquidity solvency and risk profile we will remain focused on maintaining a medium lowrisk profile and on capital efficiency and asset rotation to ensure a solid capital ratio so as we embark on our new strategy phase ph all this plan should increase revenue and improve the efficiency and profitability of our banks with the overall aim of supporting shareholder value creation and sustainability in profitability as previously explained our outstanding results in the first quarter puts us in an excellent position to meet our financial targets however we may meet them in a slightly different way than initially anticipated depending on the evolution of the macro environment we are convinced that we are going to achieve our rote target but probably through a higher contribution from europe and mexico and a potential lower contribution from the us finally were also optimistic regarding our mediumterm targets that we announced at the investor day as i told our shareholders at the annual general meeting these targets are specific ambitious and achievable we have the vision of where we want to go and the right strategy together and we have the best team in place to put it in motion so i am convinced that we will progress quarterbyquarter to achieve our targets thank you very much begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and héctor we can start the qa session now banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions we already have the first question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas hi good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions i just have two questions the first one is on the outlook at group level for nii and fees if i just look to you have made the guidance provided by the bank in investor day and for of doubledigit revenue growth but as the year goes by i think that that target gets challenged a bit so wanted just to get a bit of your thoughts on where should we particularly on nii where should the acceleration coming and based on the comments that you made at the end héctor a bit of what would be the outlook for the us nii after the performance of the first quarter the second one is on cost of risk have seen a decline in npls in brazil just wanted to be to get a bit of your thoughts about how should we expect cost of risk evolving from here in brazil and whether we have ph seen uptick in npl or its just a seasonal effect thank you héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay hello ignacio thank you very much for your question okay first of all as i basically discussed its quite important to understand that we will achieve what the numbers that we set at the investor day and also our guidance given that with the combination that the group is giving you okay so as i basically said were going to be a little lower in brazil and the us and we would be much better in europe and in mexico okay so its quite important to understand exactly the combination and the ph work were managing the group to get to the levels that we want okay so europe is the one that is going to give us the strongest performance for the full okay mexico should be up what we call lowdoubledigit okay and we expect also as i said weaker performance in latam with exception of mexico the us and dcb the us is down midsingledigits dcb will be lowsingle digits decline and brazil is basically midsingledigits growth backended and we expect improvements towards the second half of towards the end of the year okay on the cost of risk i will have josé basically give you some ideas josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so if i may complement the nii in europe we have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio obviously because as you know mortgage is repriced every months so we still have a long way to go in the repricing of mortgages in spain again they are 12month euriborbased and in portugal is sixmonth euriborbased so we still have again a way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in europe in terms of cost of risk in brazil as i said during my presentation we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in relative to excluding the oneoffs the cost of risk in the first quarter was the million banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 provision that we took in brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one fourth for oneoff cases for specific cases and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet so in that sense the of the quarter is clean it excludes oneoff cases and it reflects the true asset quality evolution of the quarter so for the rest of the year as the interest rates are expected to remain high we expect a better performance of our individuals portfolios because these are very short term and obviously most of them have matured already and we have been adding high quality new vintages but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the corporate sector so again all in all excluding oneoffs more or less flat yearonyear begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and héctor can we have the next question please operator next question from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes hello i wanted to ask about following the recent turmoil in the sector i wonder if you as a management have changed anything within the group in terms of liquidity and interest rate risk andor if you expect any regulatory changes in this front in general and more specifically i wonder if you can elaborate a bit more the fall in deposits during the quarter you mentioned seasonality in cib so you expect to recover those deposits in the coming quarter and also if you can update your guidance in terms of the deposit betas by the end of you were previously guiding for in spain in the uk above in the us and just lastly last question in terms of the alco portfolio in spain if you have changed your plans you were aiming for billion on average in in terms of size you are already above i have seen in the slides so you can also update on this thank you héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you francisco first of all let me tell you given the turmoil and everything the group is actually responding quite well okay we have seen all the levels in deposits basically maintain themselves individuals probably is the most important part in which to of our deposits are basically individuals families etcetera which are basically very solid and very stable okay in that regard also with all these times youll always be prudent about how you manage things but i can tell you that our units are performing really well in that sense okay in terms of the deposits its always cyclical the decrease in deposits was mainly in cib as we described it was actually not very meaningful to the total size of the portfolio and we expect basically to get them back and its the normal flow of the business okay in terms of the betas i will have josé give you a little bit of detail on that josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 yeah so paco in the first quarter we had a drop of around billion in cib deposits in europe but that was seasonal if you look at the fourth quarter we had quite a strong increase but again this happens every quarter this quarter was a bit more a bit higher than in previous quarters because we also grew a lot in deposits with our customers in europe in the fourth quarter so associated basically with yearend balance sheet performance so this is not recurring and this is seasonal and but again it doesnt really affect the structure of our deposits we obviously always try to take advantage of the opportunities we had an opportunity in the fourth quarter took advantage of that is normalizing a bit in the first quarter but i would expect this seasonal behavior to happen every year betas where are we so let me tell you where we are in spain we have a in retail banking beta today is yield average yield is basis points in cib in spain european branches and global cib betas are between to so in spain if you look at the whole of the spanish balance sheet the cost is basis points with a beta of and this is we guided for the year to between to ph where still this will hold because again most of the cib business has already repriced and we expect a slow increase in the repricing of retail banking so still within the to for the year us beta is at a cost of betas were a bit higher in the first quarter not significantly higher and very much in line with the average of the system in the uk beta is and in the first quarter betas were to we guided to around for the year so if we look at our interest rate sensitivity relative to the figures we gave at investor day very much in line with europe and the us and probably a better outlook in the uk finally alco yes we expected more or less billion average in spain we are already there we might be above a little bit above that but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size of the portfolio remember that we are very very far from a neutral alco portfolio we have a negative balance sheet which is what we want to have we gradually want to close that negative sensitivity so actually buying an alco portfolio or rebuilding an alco portfolio in spain is not just a matter of its probably also a matter of and even so again we will react to what we see are the market opportunities begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you héctor and josé and thank you paco for your questions can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos peixoto from caixabank please go ahead carlos joaquim peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi yes hi good morning thank you very much for taking my call the question sorry so the first question was actually the nii and im sorry if its a bit of a recap on previous ones but i was just wondering if you could give us again the outlook for nii in both brazil and the us and i was also wondering if you could confirm just to make sure that indiscernible that there is the million oneoff positive effect in brazil nii in the quarter and then second question would be actually on fees and basically the discussion that we have seen in a european level regarding indiscernible and i was wondering if you have if you can give us some visibility on the potential amount of fees that could be impacted if there were to be an investment ban being introduced at european level thank you very much banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa hi carlos begoña here sorry to do this to you but you need to repeat all of your questions the line was terrible we couldnt understand a word here so can you start again maybe slightly slower and see if it goes better carlos joaquim peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi so trying again hopefully youll help me better so as i was saying on nii the question was really on the outlook for the us and brazil if you could recap it and also i was asking to confirm whether there was a million positive oneoff in the brazilian nii just to make sure that i got that number right and then the second question was on a potential investment ban in europe what type of impact would such ban would have in fee income for santander héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay you want me to give you exactly how do we see the nii okay its exactly the guidance that we give is million okay no sorry about that please so brazil is midsingledigit growth okay were talking and then the us is its down midsingledigit ph drop midsingle digits okay thats exactly the number josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay thank you carlos begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos for your questions can we have the next question please operator the next question from sofie peterzens for jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan thanks for taking my question i know there has been a lot of questions already on net interest income but could you kind of give a little bit more detail around when you expect net interest income to peak in your core european market nii was slightly down in the uk do you think weve seen peak nii and net interest income will kind of on a quarterly basis not improve further and when do you expect net interest income on a quarterly basis to peak in spain and when do you expect it to peak in portugal and my second question would be around the cost of deposits in mexico they increased almost quarteron quarter could you just detail what drove this increase in cost of deposits in mexico and then my final question would be on core equity tier you saw basis points of regulatory capital tailwind in the first quarter how banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 should we think about any further tailwinds or headwinds on the capital side to come and could you kind of give details on the magnitude of any potential headwinds or tailwinds to come thank you héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you sofie okay really quick as josé was explaining to you in terms of nii what we see in europe were still not where we believe were going to be mostly the majority of the portfolio will be reprice in probably april and may okay so the portfolio is still repricing and were going to see those impacts mainly in spain exactly at that time probably through the mid through the cycle of the year and towards the end this also is going to depend on whats happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that so in that sense well see that in the uk were basically seeing things stable okay we basically see that were still basically building up the way the portfolio has been going and also portugal we expect also to continue better towards the end of the year okay also the terms of what you were talking about growth in deposits in mexico youre right its still lagging behind okay the growth in customers in mexico is starting to peak what is important to do in mexico was actually to change the onboarding that we had with clients okay and that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete headtohead against our competitors so in that regard youre going to see an increase on the deposit base in mexico in the following quarters given also the new payrolls that we have contracted that are coming into the portfolio also youre going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very competitive and we have also been focused on profitability what weve been doing in mexico is mainly maintain our deposit base of individuals while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to have much better margins okay in terms of capital josé would you like to comment josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes yes sofie as you said we had the ph qa from the eba was a positive basis points we had basis points negative from other updates model updates and regulatory updates basically in corporate investment banking we would expect i dont know just a few basis points per quarter of negative headwinds from regulatory models for the rest of the year very very small charges per quarter in terms of organic capital generation if you do a simple math in the first quarter the share buyback corresponds to two quarters and we had the full impact of the spanish tax which was basis points so the first quarter only corresponded basis point so if you do a lets say clean organic capital generation we generated basis points to basis points in the quarter which is what we have always said that we organically generate to basis points per quarter and thats what we expect for the rest of the year begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you sofie for your questions can we have the next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 operator next question from ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my question ive got one in the us and one in spain the one in the us is if you can elaborate a little bit on the cost of risk drivers in the future breaking it down between probability of default loss given default what kind of measures are you taking to alleviate basically the increased installments on the auto business in particular for clients that gives you comfort basically that again provisions are not going to go above precovid levels and the one in spain is if you can give us a little bit color in terms of the breakdown of your deposit base between retail corporate and large corporate what kind of behavior are you basically seeing in each of those segments from a customer point of view how pushy especially the retail side actually are being these days in terms of chasing additional remuneration thank you héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you ignacio let me explain exactly whats going on in the us okay in terms of cost of risk we expect the cost of risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning what we saw a little bit in some of the vintages from started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected but its quite interesting to see that normally when you see customers in those vintages starting to get delinquent for more than days usually we repossess between and of the autos okay whats been happening and it was being quite surprising is that whenever we see the clients going delinquent beyond days we see that they basically are calling us restructuring and start paying us back so we have seen a decrease of repos from around to to around to okay thats basically points thats why youll see the cost of risk is getting much better in the us okay to your question basically of going back to precovid levels whats going on there is that we have changed the mix of the portfolio precovid we had a lot more in subprime and deep subprime today we have a much larger part in the portfolio of prime and nearprime in the business so thats why the portfolio is never going to go back to the levels indiscernible also in we had ph bluestone okay if you remember we actually eliminated that jv back in that was basically very complicated in terms of cost of risk so thats another part of that the portfolio is actually much better because of that okay so in that sense we believe that the cost of risk in the us even though is normalizing because its going back to precovid levels is not going to be as that that it used to be but is much better than we expected at the beginning okay to conclude and in terms of the breakdown in deposits i dont know josé if you would like to indiscernible josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes so spain the in spain the spanish business we have billion in deposits individuals and smes is billion corporate clients billion when we look at the public perimeter that it includes the branches and cib in the branches we have billion and in global corporate investment banking billion for the total is what you see in the accounts of billion thank you ignacio banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you ignacio for your questions can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos cobo catena from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you for the presentation yeah and just a couple of questions because most of the doubts have been cleared but on the uk weve seen how cost of deposits also is starting to accelerate and if you could elaborate a little bit on the structural hedge and when do you foresee the peak in net interest income because youve said this year is going to be more of a flattish nii if i understood correctly does it mean that we still have to see the benefits of the structural hedge going forwards in and or how do you expect nii to combine competitive dynamics and the structural hedge upside and the second one if you could just explain a little bit better what caused this change in the eba criteria to have that positive impact on capital just to understand the rationale thank you very much josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay ill take the two of them let me answer the second one first which is easy what basically the eba has ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate because obviously if capital is eventually used lets say brazil if capital is eventually used in brazil it will be used in reais not in euros so before these the interpretation was that the capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate and now obviously because the capital will be used in local currency doesnt need to be adjusted thats a net between positives in some countries like brazil and slightly negatives in some countries like mexico where the currency has appreciated netnet basis points uk okay so in the uk yeah we still have around billion structural position which will help nii going forward we would expect mortgages to go down this year more or less around so volumes a bit down in the year but very positive nii sensitivity to rates and we still think rates might go up a little bit so we would expect nii to go up midsingle digits probably itd be more than midsingle digits so thats the expectation for this year in the uk héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you carlos begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos for your questions can we have the next question please operator next question from martha sanchez romero from citi please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 martha sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning thank you very much my first question is about the nii from your euro balance sheet the problem we have is that transfer prices across the different constituents of that balance sheet make it very difficult to track your nii performance and compare it with your peers so you guided at the capital markets day that you would make billion of extra nii in the euro balance sheet this year through that curve at the time could you please update that number today and how it breaks down between spain the corporate centre the digital bank other europe and portugal the second question is on the us deposits that was one of your expanding your deposit base was one of the pillars of your plan to improve profitability there that is now becoming more and more expensive where do you see the cost of deposits in the us by yearend and what are you doing to differentiate yourselves and being able to raise deposits without having to pay too much more than your competition and just a quick one if you could update us on the uk on what do you see for mortgage margins please thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa oh sorry ill take the first one martha i will get back to you with a breakdown but basically ph solely euro balance sheet its not that difficult to do the sensitivity but i will get back to you the sensitivity remains the same remember we said billion using the forward rates forward curve rates as of december in the first quarter the curves have remained after having moved up and down they are basically where they were at the end of december so we would still expect for the next months a sensitivity similar to the one that we have experienced in the first quarter and in line with that guidance we gave because as héctor explained we would see the ph reappreciation of our mortgage books in spain and in portugal to gradually gain speed throughout the year héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you josé okay let me tell you martha about the us deposits okay the us basically accumulated better has reached around and the cost is around okay the high interest rates reflected on the saving accounts have been showing improvements on the time deposits so what can tell you is the majority of our deposits in the us basically is individuals okay thats the bulk of them okay and they have proven themselves very stable we have really not lose any deposits at all in the individual side we have seen a little bit of movements in the midcorporates okay which we are basically diversifying deposits but nothing material in that sense okay what is important to tell you is that we dont foresee really high increases on that i mean there is a lot of competition in the market both our deposit base has been even with this situation maintained itself very stable so we dont foresee that were going to have a huge increase even with the competition from some others players that we have seen in the market okay and we are not changing our assumptions at this time in the way we see the deposits in the us okay josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa and the final question is uk mortgage margins yeah the margins for that specific business are under pressure we would expect slightly weaker margins in the mortgage business going forward right now we have a market banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 share of when we look at stock mortgages in the uk but when you look at the first quarter we have originated on average around or of the market because we are focusing only on highquality mortgages that obviously have slightly lower margins but again the combination of all our structural position volume growth and margin management in the uk should lead to mid to highsingle digits in nii in begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you martha for your questions can i have the next question please operator next question from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes thank you for taking my questions i have one question and two quick clarifications the first is essentially if we take your q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided and we just very basically add up to the end of the year we would reach billion profits in while consensus is well below that where do you see consensus being too conservative on the estimates for on the two clarifications the first is on brazilian cost of risk you indicated a flattish evolution excluding oneoffs i just want to make sure i understood correctly that the million charged on provisions this quarter is not a one off and so the guidance youre giving is at to cost of risk in the second is again on the guidance you have given before i didnt understand if it was related to nii growth or volumes when you said mexico up double digit us down midsingle digit and brazil up lowsingle digit thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay so let me take consensus and cost of risk in brazil and i will try to clarify that with consensus below where we think we might be i think we are a bit more constructive on fees and i think the first quarter shows very good performance of fees basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses youve seen in the presentation that our global businesses cib wealth management pagonxt theyre doing very very well also cost of risk we guided for lower than cost of risk we are at in the first quarter probably the market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control so those i think are the two it is a bit on nii but its not significant and a bit on cost so generally i think its provisions and fees cost of risk in brazil so the million is not in the pl and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet in brazil around onefourth of that for oneoff cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance sheet in brazil so the cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesnt have any oneoffs for specific cases from now on as i said i would expect if interest rates remain at until after the summer probably we are going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector but by no means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year so thats why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line with excluding the oneoff which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter i think that clarifies my comments and then on mexico banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa yeah on mexico what i can tell you is that youre going to see very good growth in terms of nii okay because of you are positive in the sensitivity there also what youre going to see is very positive growth in terms of fees because we are growing clients in a very good way okay mainly credit cards is one of the main drivers also cib is an important driver of fees okay and also youre going to see that the cost of risk is actually very much under control okay so youre going to see an all in all very good performance in the country given that particular situations and also that the economic situation in the country is doing very well begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you andrea for your questions can we have the next question please operator next question from britta schmidt from autonomous please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research llp yeah hi there good morning ive got a couple of questions on the deposit development in spain the decline can you maybe split the trends between corporate and retail deposits there and also a question a followup question on the cost of deposits in spain there was a quite a meaningful increase qonq do you swap any of your deposit base and is that included in the number and then lastly of course there was also loan yield expansion regarding the management of your net interest income in spain do you look more at the customer spread or do you look at the individual costing of the balance sheet and then a couple of followups on brazil could you just clarify that last years cost of risk excluding one off was around basis points ph i think another question on the polish fx saga do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the polish swiss franc mortgages and lastly one question on the regulatory outlook do you expect there to be any ph rethink either in spain or on a global level of deposit insurance charges and the funding of deposit insurance funds thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay so deposits in spain as i said billion billion drop from corporate deposits flat slightly down retail deposits in the quarter basically when you look at early mortgage repayments they are very much aligned and if we look at february and march as i mentioned positive trends in both retail and corporate deposits because again the billion drop was associated with the yearend balance sheets of our corporate deposits im not sure i understood your second question well your question was if we swap deposits or britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research llp yeah that was it banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa no we dont obviously no no we dont swap the deposits we manage net interest income sorry interest rate risks through the asset side not through the liability side how do we manage nii if i understand correctly do we look at customer margins or how do we manage that i dont understand well your question but obviously again interest rate risk management is mostly managed through the asset side and we look at the overall net interest margin of our interest earning assets brazil the cost of risk héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa cost of risk is around and excluding the oneoff that we had okay and thus and in terms of the mortgages that you asked for poland up to now the portfolio basically is reserved okay thats exactly and we are actually looking at what were going to do depending on how the portfolio evolves okay but we are now at coverage of the total portfolio begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you britta for the questions can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi very quickly hopefully two questions for me on provisions on the us i know you touched on an earlier question on it but i just wanted to understand the car prices so far have been better indiscernible yeartodate and indiscernible data thats also doing slightly better and the npls were down so why didnt the provisions in a seasonally lower quarter they didnt go down as much is there a lag effect here how quickly do secondhand car prices feed into the model maybe some handholding there and i dont know if you can be more specific on your updated views for the full year cost of risk in the us and on brazil i dont know if youve touched on this but should we expect any more topups or oneoffs in brazil beyond the recurrent cost of risk that youve already touched on josé thanks héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa alvaro in the provisions on the us okay its very important that you understand that i already explained exactly how the vintages are performing the other the previous vintages are basically performing quite well okay the thing is there are a couple of things first of all if you remember with the stimulus we actually dropped quite a lot the amount of provisions that we had what were having right now is were having to make some of the provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with ifrs okay ifrs as you understand the new definition of default that was put in place two years ago didnt hit us as much in the us because the portfolio was performing completely different okay so when you turn that portfolio to ifrs the ph nod the new definition of default basically requires you to create a lot more provisions even banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond days okay i dont know if im explaining correctly because its quite complicated so what im trying to tell you that ifrs does not prevent i mean sees that the portfolio could be so irregular in the way it performs okay so normally a portfolio in europe beyond days et cetera will be i mean go for repossession a portfolio in the us is not performing exactly like that its actually beyond days is performing much better and the client might pay you one installment two installments and then would pay you not to pay you one installment and then would pay you again et cetera okay so thats why you see those difference and the movements in the provisions on the car prices even though youre right car prices are better than the are much better than we expected and the mannheim is actually at better levels at the end cost of risk in the us is going to be around okay its exactly what we think and in terms of yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so let me just compared with prepandemic héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa correct josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa all right so as we were saying it will gradually normalize but it is actually performing a little bit better this year and it will not reach prepandemic levels because of the change in the mix that héctor was referring to but this year we would expect it to be around héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay and in terms of brazil its exactly alvaro as josé just explained you rates in brazil at around okay inflation is actually just below what josé was explaining you if the rates continue to be that way there might be the possibility that some of the big corporates or mediumsized corporates start to suffer okay we dont see that individual portfolio would suffer because its shorter term is managed in a different well and is a little bit inelastic to the rates but the corporate portfolio in the midcorporates mainly and smes could suffer because of that josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa but at the same time individuals is improving and you can see that actually in the first quarter cost of risk isolated up because we are growing in highquality retail loans and the old vintages are maturing very very quickly so even with that possible and we dont know but it may happen possible deterioration in the cost of risk in the corporate sector we would still expect to be in line with the guideline that we gave at investor day for a flat cost of risk yearonyear excluding oneoffs and no the answer is no we dont expect any significant oneoffs for the rest of the year banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2023 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you alvaro for your questions can we have the last question please operator next question from fernando gil de santivanes from bestinver securities please go ahead fernando gil de santivanes dornellas q analyst bestinver sociedad de valores sa hi thank you very much for taking my question just two quick ones on liquidity and lcr ratios how do you see the yearend lcr ratios at a group level spain portugal and the us please and can you please remind us of the tltro maturities that the bank has thank you very much multiple speaker josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa ah no okay so no the lcrs very difficult to predict but around to in every unit at least for the group it might be a bit higher than that because of the liquidity of the corporate centre but when we look at specific units or above tltro we have billion left so we have repaid billion this billion will mature gradually until the billion billion in santander spain billion in santander consumer finance and billion in portugal begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and
