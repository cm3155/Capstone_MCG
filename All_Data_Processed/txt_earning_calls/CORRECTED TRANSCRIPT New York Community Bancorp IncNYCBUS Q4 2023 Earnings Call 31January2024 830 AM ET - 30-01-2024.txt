good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today before we go into the details of this years results i would like to provide some commentary to put the past year into perspective when i was appointed president and ceo three years ago we embarked upon transforming the legacy new york community bank business model from a monoline thrift to a dynamic diversified full service commercial bank was an important inflection point we built on the momentum created by the flagstar acquisition that closed in december of and continue to successfully execute our transformation strategy while establishing a clear path for future growth we reported billion of net income available to common stockholders up from million in we significantly diversified our balance sheet with commercial loans representing an increasingly greater percentage of total loans similarly the percentage of noninterestbearing deposits to total deposits have nearly quadrupled since just before we closed the flagstar acquisition we began the flagstar integration successfully meeting every milestone throughout the year with the systems conversion set for midfebruary we also unveiled a rebranding campaign that well launch shortly after the systems conversion is completed which has been wellreceived both internally and externally and we acquired select financially and strategically complementary assets and liabilities from signature bank which strengthened our balance sheet by adding a significant amount of low cost deposits and added a middle market business supported by over private banking teams importantly the addition of signature bank new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 catapulted us to over billion in total assets placing us firmly in the category iv large bank class of banking institutions in billion and billion in total assets the last three years were all a build up at this moment and since the closing of the flagstar acquisition in particular we have been preparing to cross this important threshold when the opportunity to acquire signature presented itself and we were honored to be selected as the winning bidder by the fdic the benefits were clear this acquisition allowed us to advance our strategy while strengthening and diversifying our balance sheet however this acquisition also meant we will become a billionplus bank sooner than we had anticipated subjecting us to enhanced prudential standards including risk based and leverage capital requirements liquidity standards and requirements for overall risk management and stress testing alongside the integration of three banks nycb signature and flagstar and as we prepare for our first capital plan submission in april of this year we have pivoted quickly and accelerated some enhancements that come with being a category iv bank specifically we are taking decisive actions to build capital strengthen our balance sheet and risk management processes which better aligns us with the relevant peers for bank of our larger size and complexity these actions include investing to strengthen our risk management capabilities to align with the enhanced prudential standards applicable to cat iv banks as set forth on the reg yy building our reserve levels which brings our acl coverage more in line with peer banks including category iv banks and adding on balance sheet liquidity as we prep for regulation yy compliance we believe these actions are another prudent step enhancing our risk management infrastructure i will go on to more details in a moment on how these actions impacted our results in the fourth quarter we are also accelerating our capital build by reducing our common stock dividend to per share we understand the importance and the impact of this decision to our stockholders this was not made lightly while ncyb remains wellcapitalized under all applicable regulatory requirements resetting our capital allocation priorities was a necessary step to accelerate the building of our capital we are confident that these actions we took in the fourth quarter and the continued execution of our strategy will position the company to deliver enhanced value over the long term we successfully grew into a billionplus bank in and we believe the actions we are taking now are building the foundation to make our transition to a billionplus bank even more successful moving now to the results the company reported billion in net income available to common stockholders in or per diluted share on an operating basis which excludes merger related charges a billion bargain purchase gain related to signature transaction and a onetime special fdic assessment of million reported net income available to common stockholders was million or per diluted share as i said earlier the actions we undertook impacted several items during the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of we reported a net loss of million or per share on an operating basis the company reported a net loss of million or per share our fourth quarter results were impacted by the actions we undertook including a million provision for credit losses lets begin with asset quality nonperforming loans were stable in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of the year despite some continued weakness in the commercial real estate sector at december nonperforming loans totaled million and represented basis points of total loans compared to million or basis points in the previous quarter during the fourth quarter we significantly built our reserves to address office sector weakness and an expected increase in criticized loans due to repricing risk in the multifamily portfolio which better aligns nycb with our relevant peer bank including category iv banks at december the allowance for credit losses was million up million compared to the previous quarter and represented of total loans up from basis points compared to the previous quarter excluding loans with new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 government guarantees and lower risk mortgage warehouse loans the acl coverage was in the fourth quarter compared to basis points in the previous quarter since the third quarter of we have built our reserves by million net chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points of average loans driven by two loans first we had one coop loan with a unique feature that prefunded capital expenditures although the borrower is not in default we transferred the loan to held for sale in the fourth quarter and expect it to be sold during the first quarter importantly this loan is a oneoff and our review did not uncover any other coop loans similar to this one second we had an additional chargeoff of an office loan that became nonaccrual in the third quarter based on an updated valuation this loan was more than we originally expected and we responded by recalibrating our qualitative factors in the office portfolio to address the issue and increase the acl coverage on the office portfolio collectively these two loans accounted for the bulk of the charges we took during the fourth quarter the other major action we took was regarding our on balance sheet liquidity during the fourth quarter we began preparing to be regulation yy compliant though this was earlier than we originally anticipated we thought it prudent to be ready to meet the enhanced liquidity requirements that apply to category iv banks therefore we had monetized some of our contingent liquidity sources and started to build our on balance sheet liquidity during the fourth quarter which has continued into q1 we realize that this will negatively impact our net interest margin in the short term but is essential that we as a newly minted billion bank prudently manage our liquidity moving next to net interest margin the fourth quarter net interest margin came in at down basis points compared to the third quarter this was basis points lower than our guide of down basis points the basis points variance to the guidance was largely due to actions related to increase our on balance sheet liquidity and higher deposit costs on the lending front total loans held for investment were up million or annualized compared to the third quarter of to billion most of the growth occurred in the ci portfolio partially offset by a decline in multifamily while the rest of the cre portfolio remained unchanged at december total commercial loans represented of total loans while multifamily loans represented of total loans representing significant diversification from a year ago turning now to deposits total deposits at year end were billion compared to billion at the end of the third quarter the decrease was primarily driven by an expected billion decrease in custodial deposits related to the signature transaction excluding these deposits the total deposits increased million or annualized compared to the third quarter primarily driven by growth in cds partially offset by lower noninterestbearing deposits the shift to higher cost cds was due to increased competition and customer behavior deposits from legacy signature teams excluding deposits to the loan portfolio we did not retain increased billion at the end of march moving now to expenses the full year noninterest expense we noncore expenses which this quarter included the fdic special assessment of million total opex for the three months ended december were million down million compared to million for the three months ended september the decrease was primarily driven by compensation and benefits expense due to lower incentive compensation expense partially offset by higher professional fees turning now to our full year guidance in the past we have typically provided just quarterly guidance however in order to provide more transparency and to be more in line with industry peer practices we are providing standard full year guidance in which we had summarized in our investor presentation slides and in we expect period ending total loans to decline to compared to december period ending total deposit to increase between to cash and securities balances to increase billion on a combined new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 basis the net interest margin to for the full year exclusive of inclusive of actions to increase on balance sheet liquidity for regulation yy compliance noninterest income in the range of million to million which includes mortgagerelated income of million to million operating expenses in the range of billion to billion due to a full year impact from signature bank the full year impact of private banking teams from the former first republic bank signature bank integration deferral to in order to minimize customer impact and additional cost related to becoming a category iv bank normal compensation and benefits expense increases and approximately million of conversion related savings from flagstar we expect our cet1 regulatory capital ratio for the holding company to be at by year end and its and a full year tax rate we entered having taken prudent balance sheet actions as we become a category iv bank importantly the bank has a solid foundation in place and a proven track record across business cycles we believe we are positioned well to navigate our growth and development as an organization and deliver for customers and we are confident that it will enable us to deliver longterm value for stockholders finally i would like to say a special thank you for all of our teammates we have a fantastic team and as always we deeply appreciate the dedication and commitment to our clients customers and communities with that well be happy to answer any questions you may have operator please open up the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch hi good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch good morning i guess maybe if we can start on credit so obviously it took a huge reserve build this quarter just talk to us in terms of your expectations around losses going forward so one whats the reserve build at the end of the fourth quarter cover and what that imply for future reserve build through the course of and then give us a sense relative to the chargeoff you took in the fourth quarter basis points where do you see credit losses migrating next year and if you expect any losses to come from the multifamily book thanks thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hey there appreciate the question ebrahim let me just give you a general view of the fourth quarter and the process on where we came in at obviously we looked at the marketplace looked at the office perspective and the general office weaknesses throughout the country and we really did a deep dive in the office portfolio as well new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 as thinking through payment shock and interest rate shock given the rise of interest rates that weve experienced over the past few quarters in particular the impact to our customers in respect to repricing we took into account that perspective and clearly had significant additions to our reserve build where a lot of that reserve build went into the office in particular i believe the number went from basis points reserve from q3 to basis points reserve in particular for office so given that we gave out the statistics on the actual performance of the portfolio there hasnt been a whole lot of change in respect to the npas and delinquencies however we had moved some of these loans into a status of criticized position because of the nature of looking and thinking about the office sector and the reserve build out with the anticipation of office still having difficulties within the marketplace that being said basis points i believe gets us very close to in line with our current peer group which is a new peer group category iv banks as i indicated in my previous remarks and were confident that we continue to look at the portfolio at in significant detail as we are now benchmarking ourselves into a marketplace that has changed no question has changed and weve focused in on payment shock interest rate shock and the development in the commercial space if you want john if you want to add some more comments back to the acl and then the calculation there as well john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure tom and besides the office portion of the acl though the other item that tom mentioned earlier is around the multifamily loan portfolio and the repricing risk in that portfolio as we see our loans continue to hit their option date and reprice higher we want to make sure that that risk is captured in the qualitative factors as well this quarter so we were able to do that and increase the reserve on multi as well so we saw increases specifically in office and cre and multi when you look at a coverage ratio from an acl perspective ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch right but do you expect that the coverage and the pressure on multi translating into losses on that portfolio john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc on the multifamily portfolio we have not seen significant losses in multifamily with the exception of course of the one loan that tom mentioned the multifamily coop loan which rolls up to the multifamily category and historically if you look back at what weve had higher levels of substandard throughout the financial crisis throughout the pandemic those that just the rise in substandard loans does not lead directly to specific losses so were still very comfortable in the quality of the multifamily portfolio were not seeing anything on the early stage delinquency side yet either we did see a little pop in to days but a lot of those loans we had about million that cleared right after and the first couple of weeks of january so were not seeing any significant trends in the multifamily portfolio besides the repricing risk that we spoke about thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so ebrahim ph in respect of that comment i would add that when you think about how we looked at the forward curve when we looked at the interest rate environment as of the fourth quarter we did not take into account changes in future interest rates when we shock the cash flow both the payment shock and interest rate shock so we believe thats pretty punitive in the event of a potential side pivot but were assuming that rates stay new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 where they are and roll that out for a year and what is the impact on future ph bars that have to go into ph year six and it will go ph on a higher structure and amortizing structure and we shocked them that put a lot of those loans closer to a debt service coverage ratio in some cases slightly below on a pro forma basis and that will be a substandard view of the asset although they are in performance status and as you all know last year we had an abundance of customers take the sofr option when sofr was much lower and obviously they ran through that theyre waiting on the sidelines they feel very strongly that theyre going to exercise their ability to lock in longerterm financing when rates move the other way so they are sitting on the sidelines paying the bank go for closer spread and theyll make the decisions when theres a possibility of a rate change thats what were hearing from our customer base ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch got it and maybe john just on the net interest margin so fourth quarter is that just given the trajectory of the to like what do you expect the nim to reset in the first quarter and then what have is that guidance still hold if we get three or four rate cuts during the year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes yeah on your second question yes the guidance would still hold with three rate cuts throughout the year and if you look at the full year to margin were comfortable with that for the first quarter as well probably a little closer in the first quarter to the lower end of that spectrum but were comfortable with the guide both for the year and for the first quarter ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch got it ill hop out thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody so i want to follow up on net interest income so you guys gave us most of the components for the guide without net interest income you probably noticed your stock trading at pre market which i think is a or 25year low and its because all of us are running the math on earning asset levels applying the nim guide and you get earnings that are down like if you do that is that what you guys are guiding to for john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so the guide we gave when you look at net interest margin you see where the loans come down and with deposits increasing that is not exactly where the totals were seeing from down im not quite sure exactly how you came up with that number but you got to look at some of the security builds as well and the cash on the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 balance sheet so when you put all that together from a earnings perspective that sounds much lower than what we would have anticipated that youd be coming out with thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and steven i would just i would also add to johns commentary that we are solving for reg yy steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc its a significant its a substantial cash build in the billions of dollars i think our guide has an additional billion on top of numbers for and thats going to really impact until that we rightsize our position on liquidity where we need to be as a category iv bank have a negative impact on the margin in the short term over the long term we hope to normalize our cash positions as we rightsize our businesses and focus on relationship lending where deposit base comes from the relationship and looking at lines of businesses that are deposit rich not deposit starved thats the journey as we go into this category iv peer group and clearly this is impacting for sure john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and there will be pressure no doubt as we transition from loans to lower yielding securities or cash so that absolutely youll see in that guide on the net interest margin the thats the transition thats going to happen in and then well see that start to change as we can continue to grow the portfolio in and beyond thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and i would also add steven is that clearly we havent seen any activity in multifamily cre so its been about a reduction in activity originations there are no real property activities happening right now so we have a relatively low coupon on the book and some billions of dollars that have the possibility of moving either into a higher coupon and off our balance sheet as we focus on relationship deposit lending and thats clearly the focus as we focus our commercial bank efforts to focus on doing commercial lending but more importantly reallocating our resources to businesses and lines of businesses that have a unique return perspective as a commercial bank full service commercial bank so its prudent to expect that a lot of these larger relationships that we have that are not depository relationships will end up gravitating off the balance sheet probably to the government over time as rates reset themselves and we have the ability to move on those low coupons off balance sheet as we rightsize our position as a full service commercial bank steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so if i put together everything you guys just said why not just give us what you think net interest income will be in so were not all guessing and maybe your stock wont trade down to like john why dont you just tell us where you you might be wrong because you said basically we do we just took earning assets we applied your margin we go said okay this is where nii is falling out with the other midpoints and its down new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 substantially youre saying its not that but you just cut the dividend maybe do your shareholders a favor and tell us what do you think nii will be in you know better than we do because you know what was impacted fully in the quarter theres certain actions you took which didnt fully impact the quarter so why not just john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc youre correct steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc give the color so why not just john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc give us the number to make life easy john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah absolutely when we looked at steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc by the way when your stock at a 25year low i cant imagine youre happy with this so unless you want i dont know why you wouldnt take this opportunity to level set expectations thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well steven were very focused by that the market will truly understand the strategy going forward were in a category iv bank strategy we were wellpositioned at the closing of flagstar at the end of last year and an opportunity came up to acquire signature bank we took advantage of that opportunity were very grateful to have the fdic approve that transaction and were in a different perspective when it comes to our peer group these necessary steps need to happen in respect to rightsizing ourselves around these category peers and clearly going forward were focusing on building the bank in the market where we said itself fully understands the strategy we appreciate your commentary on guide we wanted we felt it was prudent for us to give some guidance for the full year as you know steven youve been covering us for a long time we will be giving quarterly guide we want to extend that but as john indicated a lot of this is significant cash balances at a slight negative carry thats impacting the drag on the margin and as we reset ourselves into the future we believe that the market will truly understand the expectations of our category iv expectations both the capital build which has driven off the dividend adjustment along with the guidance that we have which is we feel its something that we felt more transparent as going out a full year not just the quarter to show where our cet1 expectations will be at the end of and more importantly rightsize ourselves for the future as we build out a new category iv expectations new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got it thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you steven operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys just one on the expense side where do you guys anticipate finishing the year roughly just on a quarterly basis i know you talked about being elevated in the first part of the year as you go through your integrations and if you can talk about and sorry if i missed it but the updated timing on the signature integration would be great john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so the updated timing we pushed the signature integration into just to ensure we have minimal customer impact and make sure that weve gone through the flagstar integration process that were still on track for here in february get through that integration so thats why youll see a little bit less of a cost save in so your run rate at the end of will be a little bit higher yes weve guided that the first quarter is typically a higher quarter for us especially in compensation and benefits and as well as the systems conversion will happen in february so you will see the first quarter be the higher quarter but from a trend perspective the fourth quarter when youre going into will be in that lower end of the range that we gave on an annualized basis with the start of the year at the higher end of the range david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thanks and then just on the credit analysis that youve done for this quarter it sounds like youre assuming stable rates through year end and im assuming that that incorporates all the repricing youre expecting new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 in the multifamily book through year end so its kind of a catch all for everything that youre looking at through is that right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc dave i want to be clear on that we did a deep dive in q4 and we assumed rates that are at the current level in q4 we did not anticipate the forward curve adjusting downwards so we took that into account when we looked at the acl to establish the risk in respect of repricing i believe we have about billion john indiscernible billion coming due to reprice in john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc multifamily billion thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so when you take that into account as far as what that impacts these loans are going from a very low coupon to the market ph most customers decide to lock in at fixed rate versus keep the floating rate as they make the decision last year would be more like were taking sofr options at the beginning of actually towards the tail end of it was more like and some of them were grabbing the fixed rate option so its more compelling for them to take a fixed rate option now but the rate is still high compared to the current coupon that theyre coming out of i will tell you with specificity customers are waiting on the sidelines theres not a lot of activity i indicated that reduction in the business people are on the sidelines theyre expecting that rates will move in the back half of and theyll make their longterm decisions in the next round of refinancing and as i indicated very clearly we anticipate the focus on relationship deposit lending so in the event we have a nonrelationship loan coming at a coupon coming off the books theyll probably end up in the government unless they want to be a full service commercial bank client with the bank that will gravitate our concentration to multifamily down significantly assuming that there not going to be a full service relationship with the company that is the strategy going forward its going to be relationship lending and clearly we have an opportunity to take a very low coupon off the portfolio assuming theres a shift in customer sentiment to lock in the next round of financing which many of our customers are focusing in the second half of david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc so with your bumped up classified loan balance that assumes all the repricing that youre expecting for this year and where you see those debt service coverage ratio is going based on the rates that youre seeing today is that right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah yeah thats not on the forward curve thats at this david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 yeah thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc fourth quarter so david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and those two options the fixed option is still over and then the sofr is over sofr is that right those two repricing options thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc just to be clear we assumed they all went to the sofr option so the more punitive option because theres conservatism there we do not take their fixed rate option as an option so we went more conservative and looked at indiscernible everyone arrive at sofr curve but still they decide to lock in the next round of refinancing which also stress the debt service coverage ratio so sofr versus the fixed rate option is more punitive david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and more recently theyve been going into the fixed rate option right because thats the least punitive option thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes the activity has been very very slow than what weve indicated probably towards the back end of the fourth quarter of last year more like of them are locking in some fixed rate terms but still a high percentage of them going to ph roll sofr with the expectation rates are going to be projected to go low in david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it and wheres the multifamily reserve now how much provision went into the multifamily book versus the office book indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah when you look at the allowance coverage ratio quarteroverquarter is up so we went from basis points to basis points thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it perfect new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks guys ill step back operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone so question on the cet1 target i kind of reiterate what steve was talking about with the ppnr guide relative to consensus and im coming out at like ph million for next year which i know you guys are talking about the balance sheet loans down so you get some deleveraging on the risk weighted asset front but basically to get to that that bps of cet1 build credit is going to provision is going to have to be de minimis by my math so kind of again want to address what are you guys baking in for provision to get to that level and is that aggressive john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean if you look at the provision that we took in the fourth quarter were not were expecting that that covers the emerging risks and the portfolio that we have currently as you know through cecl external factors changes in the portfolio macroeconomic changes is going to impact what our provision is going forward so historically if you look at where our provisions have been they have not been as big as of course we took in the fourth quarter we are very comfortable with the early delinquencies that were seeing and those trends have not dramatically jumped up so when you look at that concept of where the provision can be will flow through of course our cecl models and go through that process but yeah theres not a anywhere near as a significant provision as we saw in the third and the fourth quarter combined in that were expecting right now given what were seeing in the portfolio and in the portfolio dynamics we do appreciate that substandard and criticized loans of course could still increase from here and thats something that we will manage through as we go forward but when were looking at that potential thats what weve tried to capture in our cecl modeling with the facts that we know right now thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hey casey its tom indiscernible obviously the dividend adjustment getting back to accretive of capital is also forecasted at a cet1 for the year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 thats right as well as the shrink in rwa as were taking loans down and were growing it with cash and securities to a lesser extent of course securities in the fannie and freddie space casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so of the criticized assets in office and in multifamily it looks collectively it looks at about billion how much of that is coming due in john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc from a maturity perspective its a very very low number from an option perspective its a very manageable amount because when you look kind of through why it would be substandard is it was coming through in that year bucket that tom mentioned so when were looking at repricing risk a lot of the substandard category would be the stuff thats coming through in the next months from a repricing perspective so when we look at especially on the multi side those would be coming up to their option dates a large portion of that number and thats due to the fact that thats how were capturing that repricing risk is thats getting to that or just over or just under coverage ratio casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thanks operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh good hey good morning tom and john the slide mentioned the goodwill impairment test and i know in the past when banks have had to write off goodwill its led to the dividend i assume this is a little bit reverse order where you cut the dividend first and may impair intangibles the goodwill going forward is that kind of the right way to read it john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well were in the middle of evaluating the goodwill on our balance sheet and going through the process to see and evaluate if there is any impairment of goodwill as you know that goodwill stems from transactions back to but we will evaluate that based on the facts in the fourth quarter and what were looking at now as part of our impairment analysis and well make that decision christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but if you were to impair it would there be any subsequent action you think would need to happen i guess is the question new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no from a capital from a regulatory capital ratio the goodwill impairment wouldnt impact regulatory capital ratios so theres not anything else that i would expect christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe tom for you whether its at or cut to numbers we can work through our numbers but the roe is going to be by my math kind of mid to upper single digits how do we think about just the roe construct of this company now that youre through ph billion understanding youve got some nearterm headwinds but how do you think about roe thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good question i mean obviously is going to be the year of the category iv ph comparisons for us we have some heavy lifting to focus on regarding balance sheet metrics the acl which we built up significantly the dividend adjustment ph with both cet1 but going forward we think about the long term prospects of the business model the company is in a unique position to compete were focused on being within the median peer group over time and were gravitating with a significant enhanced liquidity position as a result of reg yy thats really driving the margins under pressure in as we reset the cost structure as we integrate the systems the processes and build out the businesses and we focus on businesses that have higher returns to the company we focus on relationship banking we would like to be in the median peer group over time its not going to happen in but thats the strategy over the longer term as the market understands the longerterm strategy to be a category iv bank as our peer group has changed dramatically going from billion prior to the acquisition of signature in march into the right and catapulted into the billion club we have some balance sheet items that we need to focus on and we believe we were focused in the q4 to address some of those items the capital build we talked about that was going to be about operating effectively as institution with enhanced financial standards and risk governance framework thats necessary as we roll out this category iv bank and over time if you think about the median peer group over time thats what well strive for its not going to be a story its going to be a long term story and hopefully the market will truly understand the longterm story as we reset ourselves as a category iv bank christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks tom thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning john i know you talked a little bit about the migration of criticized assets what are your thoughts that has to happen on those and again what did you recognize that could go wrong from here john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so when you look yeah when you at the migration a lot of it will do partially to interest rates so depending on what happens to the fiveyear part of the curve that can change dramatically the trajectory of especially the multifamily book were seeing the loans that hit their option date take that floating rate option that is not the typical spot that these borrowers want to be so depending on what happens with rates we can see some movement pretty quickly in that portfolio from a paying off perspective or just the rerating of that portfolio as rates start to drop and the payment shock gets less and less and we start to see more and more information on financials and how the cash flows and the net operating income is coming on thatll start the trend of getting these closer and closer to out of the criticized buckets thats kind of the thought process were looking at is its dependent on interest rates and where theyre headed given the trend were starting to see now were hoping that thats abated and we could see less of that repricing risk on the customers thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i just want to reiterate the magnitude of what weve seen historically with the customers is that running in place we were doing billion a year in net originations as a company and we ran in place the growth was in mid singledigits net loan growth and when we were standalone nycb franchise focusing on multifamily lending last year our originations are like i indicated down we did about million versus ph million a very small number million john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc million thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so thats a significant drop of activity if things what you really focus on the next round of refinancing and locking in your longerterm funding scenario as a client theyre on the sidelines and theyre going to focus on whats the next to 10year financing deal that theyll tend to look at and we feel very strongly that many customers are focusing on back half of to make that longerterm decision with the expectation that the fed is in a position to pivot which will have a position on our customers to take advantage of longterm financing right now they lock in a fixed rate coupon its more attractive than the sofr option and many customers still choose the sofr option as theyre looking to make those decisions as we go into the back half of we talked about the billion coming due last year most of those loans are sofr we see a little bit of a shift to fixed rate at the same time theres a significant appetite by the agencies to take these types of loans and were going to be very focused to rightsize our position to ensure that relationship lending stays on the book and nonrelationship lending will move outside of the portfolio as we reduce our exposure to this area and put our cash flows into businesses that have higher returns as a firm new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc tom thanks thats helpful background and just a followup i guess is do any of your borrowers have alternatives outside of the banking industry could they go to alternative funds or is that interest rate simply too great for them to consider thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc great point i mean look the government is open for business there are huge appetite for this product mix the agency is always one of our largest competitors theres other bank and competition as well as some of the largest banks in the country were pricing our risk accordingly we feel very strongly that its going to be a relationship driven model that will focus on true customer relationships and ultimately our largest competitor is fannie and freddie and they have probably close to collectively billion of an appetite on an annual basis there hasnt been any activity last year was the lowest activity weve seen actually lower even during the pandemic so were in a unique position given the fact that theres no activity but when activity does pick up and rates do tend to move customers will find the best vehicle and the government is very accommodative there christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of steve moss with raymond james please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning just kind of on the loan side here just given the change in the growth outlook curious how are you guys thinking about commercial real estate concentrations relative to capital and how were thinking about the loan portfolio remixing here going forward thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah great question steve and obviously were targeting down growth thats really driven off of my dialogue im talking about customers going to the government versus staying in our portfolio its nonrelationship we are moving towards a relationship lending bank focus and clearly our other lines of business which are high return businesses will have the ability to build up our ci book over time we have reggie davis here he can talk specifically about some of those specific ph siloes as well as lee smith on the warehouse so new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 clearly we have a focus on moving out of a high degree of concentration which you indicated and focus on relationship lending and moving the cash flows into higher return businesses ph yeah lee lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage new york community bancorp inc yeah sure i mean i think tom is right yeah from a warehouse lending point of view as you know were the second largest warehouse lender if you look at the mortgage market in q4 it was down but our warehouse and msr outstandings were flat and i think we benefited from dislocation in the market and weve grown market share from a mortgage finance point of view and were also leveraging those relationships from a deposit point of view so as mentioned before we picked up a cash and treasury management team as part of the signature acquisition and theyre working very closely with our warehouse team and our mortgage team to leverage deposits from our ph tpos warehouse borrowers msr borrowers and the msr owners we subservice for and right now were probably generating anywhere from billion to billion of deposits from that mortgage ecosystem that we touch steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc so maybe lets put it this way is there a commercial real estate to total capital ratio you guys are targeting longer term that we should think about going forward here thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc no i mean look if you carve out multifamily i think our cre ratio is probably in the mid low hundreds is that right john low hundreds so when you look at our legacy multifamily portfolio which weve been doing for multiple decades and we have a long track record of success there were going to look at like i indicated very specifically relationship deposit lending so as we look at the marketplace we have the lowest interest rate weve had in our public life thats going to have to make a decision in the out quarters and out years ahead we are going to be very prudent to manage that risk and manage the cre concentrations and move it into higher yielding businesses assuming these customers are not depositors its going to be deposit driven thats going to be a significant shift on our concentration by that business strategy as becoming a full service commercial bank steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and maybe just one on office here i mean obviously a big driver of the reserve build as you guys stress test that portfolio does it is this do we think about this as a true up to the office reserve allocation or do you should we expect further reserve build up this level john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so we did a really as tom mentioned earlier really deep dive on the office portfolio and really took into account some of the more recent appraisals were seeing and what were seeing in that sector and really tried to capture that risk in that portfolio so the coverage the basis points of coverage that we have there were comfortable with right now we still have two loans that are the same loans we talked about in the third quarter that are sitting in nonaccrual we havent seen any other significant trends from a delinquency perspective yet in that portfolio so were comfortable with where we are now well continue to revisit it of course as we get additional appraisals in for properties that have been rated that have been criticized but as of now were new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 comfortable with where that is and at an coverage ratio i think weve captured a lot of the risk in that portfolio that weve seen so far steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning on the capital side can you talk a little bit more about how we should think about rwa migration from here so i know youre bringing your loans down as we move through but at the same time as some of these criticized assets move into npls is there another push on rwa is there another denominator effect for capital that we should be thinking about next year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean as if nonaccruals do increase then yeah we will go to from an rwa perspective but the big benefit that were seeing from an rwa reduction is the actual loan portfolio reducing because the additions on the asset side and cash and securities as we mentioned earlier are at when were looking at cash of course ginnie securities at and to a much lesser extent some fannie and freddies at so thats the major items in the rwa walk as you mentioned its the offset between any changes that were estimating in nonaccrual compared to that more significant loan decline and rwa decline from the loan portfolio since there is no pickup on the security side there manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then on the percentage of book that youve scrubbed youre at current valuations there havent been many transactions there hasnt been much price discovery so how hard do you think youve hit valuations here as you build reserves in that multifamily as well as the office book john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc in the office book i mean weve looked at not only some transactions as you mentioned theres not a lot in the marketplace but we have looked at the actual appraisals that were getting and looking at the percentage change peak to trough and what those appraisals are and using that from a qualitative perspective to add to our office reserves on the multifamily portfolio as we mentioned we took rates where they are now took the more punitive structure that the option loans could turn into which is the sofr plus and hit that along with any potential amortization that can come in place so we really think we hit the portfolio from a repricing perspective on the multi side especially for those loans coming over the next months new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david smith with autonomous research please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning the actions youre taking to tighten up from a regulatory perspective affect the pace of the private banking build out at all or is there the earn backs youre expecting there thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so obviously we are highly regulated and were focused on enhanced prudential standards but in respect to signature and the teams that we built theyre doing a phenomenal job as i indicated in my prepared remarks theyve had a great year they really had stability for march were very excited about the stability and more importantly they had growth billion net growth and the teams are geared up the first republic team started onboarding and focusing on relationship and white glove service reggie davis do you want to expand on some of the initiatives that we have working with the teams if you want to expand upon that as well reginald e davis a senior executive vice president presidentconsumer corporate banking new york community bancorp inc yeah and i actually want to speak more to the banking group because the private bank consists of the legacy first republic teams and legacy signature teams but were now under one envelope so i kind of want to talk about the success and some of the progress that weve made in weve essentially taken four distinct teams and created one highly focused banking organization and as tom mentioned earlier we created a single brand and we launched that brand internally in midyear and thats something the teams have really rallied around i think the brand represents the current capabilities and future aspirations of the combined company weve also completed restructuring of the banking group in total so the new structure has some synergies quite frankly between the four legacy institutions taking advantage of each others strengths and part of creating that new structure was reducing the number of client coverage models from to so now we operate as the private bank the commercial banking group and the consumer banking group and as a result of that and i think tom mentioned this we discontinued operations in several legacy businesses to further focus on relationship banking and so the translation of that is if were going to use our balance sheet were going to use it to get deposits and so we combined also combined two separate branch teams from legacy flagstar and nycb under one leadership structure we introduced common routines common client engagement models common tools across the entire network and weve also accelerated our onto a common platform with common ai tools across the entire branch network weve also combined our retail investment business into one platform one structure under one leader and then weve also combined our wealth management organization with a clear mandate around teaming up with both the commercial bank and the private bank for greater relationship experienced and so the legacy first republic teams and signature teams are under one leader and together they comprise the private new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 banking group and as tom said their performance has really been stellar this year theyve recaptured after all the deposits that we lost in march and april timeframe which is about billion billion in addition the dda portion of that book has been rock solid at billion and thats essentially unchanged because that represents the operating accounts that are very much reflective of the relationship nature of those deposits and then also our retail bank only lost of the deposits in march and april timeframe and quite frankly weve captured all of that back as well so those two businesses the private bank and the retail bank are deposit engines for the company and i might add from a signature perspective we havent lost anything and the addition of the signature book has actually helped us from a mix perspective in our deposit book it shifted it from a presignature to cd which is actually more in line with our peers so we feel really good our deposits actually grew up quarteroverquarter and thats a lot has a lot to do with the growth embedded in our retail bank and in the legacy signature book and we expect that to continue quite frankly were starting to see more and more momentum and more success as those teams are part of our larger organization so all good new stories david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay so not looking to really take your foot off the gas there yet thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i think the reality is that deposit deposit deposit we have a great opportunity with an experienced bankers that are welcome here and the energy as reggie indicated in that long winded answer which is a lot of the positive momentum its a lot of positive momentum the conversion is happening in a few weeks from now were excited about that one platform one bank one brand but whats exciting about is that theyre focusing on their white glove service its what they do its not really a lending model here this is about deposit opportunity to service the client specifically in the middle market position david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and then on capital do you view the target at the end of this year to be an ending point or would you be looking to ultimately get your capital ratios higher thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ultimately as we think about capital we were very clear in our public announcement this morning along with our views is that we want to be within the peer group we have a new peer group that we have to attain to and thats clearly the focus here so as we gravitate to that doubledigit cet1 the dividend adjustment plus what well call a conservative view of guidance with respect to our balance sheet well generate increase in capital quarterover quarter with the expectation over time to be within the peer group thats the plan over the long term clearly we have a long history of strong payment and dividend we have to go through the capital planning process this is our first submission under the reg yy with the fed thats going to happen in april and we want to prepare for that accordingly david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs please go ahead john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning i wanted just to ask within the deposit book how much of the increase in cds was brokered cds this quarter and then the uptick in the wholesale borrowings im assuming thats all fhlb whats the remaining capacity that you have for fhlb borrowings at this point john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so from a fhlb borrowing perspective we have as of significant capacity to borrow and well use that to continue to build our liquidity here in the first quarter to as we mentioned earlier prepare for reg yy so were very comfortable with the on balance sheet liquidity and the contingent liquidity we have behind that from the broker deposit question broker deposits were up about billion broker cds were up about billion quarter overquarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay so we can the influx in the cd so the rest came from the retail network john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah the rest came from the retail network we actually raised about billion over about two months and that i mean again that reflects the strength of our retail franchise about of that were new to bank and about were existing relationship and were able to cross sell about in on checking accounts and thats going to set us up for next year in terms of converting some of those single product new clients into dda accounts relationship accounts and so its not only its good for the balance sheet obviously but long term it also will add to a cheaper funding base we feel really good about that plus new clients brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then just on the deposit front again i guess the of the deposits are uninsured but you also have escrows down this quarter for seasonality i guess i wanted to ask is the uninsured a good read on what percent of the deposit base is institutional clients at this point if not what percent of the deposit base is institutional clients and then secondarily we saw at least one other bank that went through some stress on the deposit front earlier this year signed ndas with some of its larger depositors did you guys consider doing new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 anything like that moving forward with some of your larger depositors so that they can feel good about the health of the balance sheet john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah when you look at some of those uninsured deposits theyre not all institutional by any stretch theres customers in there theres businesses in there so thats not the escrow or entirely large balance institutional deposits but if you look at the organizations we had some of some of those balances from a 15c3 and that type of money those types of business institutional type accounts we dont have a lot of those deposits at all anymore i mean that deposit base thats uninsured is primarily business type deposits and operating accounts and yeah theres a lot of dda in there as well brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you guys operator your next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning matt good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey so understanding some of the actions taken this quarter to course correct theres billion over billion bank versus some of your similar sized peers are there additional capitalrelated actions to be considered apart from cet1 so im looking at total riskbased capital your peers are at should we be considering any sort of need for additional subdebt to kind of get you to that peer range and if so when thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so matt i do appreciate the question i will tell you that between forward guide along with the dividend adjustment and our targets for cet1 were focusing on that specific area in respect to building capital obviously were waiting for the new rules on basel iii that will come out and will apply to us as a category iv bank over time but no question the adjustment on our distribution to shareholders along with building out the business and running a run rate based on our guidance is where were focused on the capital build so clearly thats going to put us slightly below the table but with the expectation of building capital over time and accreting capital going forward matthew breese q analyst stephens inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 okay and again understanding that this quarter you took some actions to course correct could you give us some balance sheet mix targets once youre done in terms of cash to assets securities to assets so where you would like to be and by when john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah well the main issue and thought process that were talking through with this quarter on onbalance sheet liquidity is just preparing for reg yy so if you look at where we were at at with the peers at were going to be in that range well be above so were going to get to that range and get closer and closer to peers as you know our securities portfolio has historically been very small on percentage basis to total assets and that securities portfolio is really the main liquidity buffer that we need to keep in place here going forward so thats why when we look at that portfolio itll be significantly skewed towards zero and risk weighted assets high quality liquid assets in order to ensure that we can meet our onbalance sheet liquidity demands and regulation so i think well be much closer to that range of our peers over time and well get there in the first and the second quarter matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and when you measure securities are we talking securities to assets or total assets because im looking at john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc total assets matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay so john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes matthew breese q analyst stephens inc securities assets today thats going to near triple by next quarter john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no you have cash in there as well right so im looking at cash and securities as a combined basis as a percentage of total assets right and thats how we manage it so we manage onbalance sheet liquidity normally that will be more in the securities portfolio given the buildup here its starting in cash and over time well be putting that out in the securities portfolio thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 i think its fair to say that the guide has most of these assets sitting in liquidity are in the form of cash john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc correct thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc which is matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and you assume that the lions share of whatever you need to do here will be completed by the end of the first quarter its not going to drag out throughout the whole year john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thats right that is correct matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then going back to the cre concentration so when you look at the cre concentration versus peers is it still appropriate to exclude multifamily given the repricing risk and do the regulators look at it that way i know for decade after decade rent regulated multifamily has been virtually risk free but post2019 the rent law changes and the new paradigm in the release in your commentary youre discussing repricing and credit risk here it feels like the cre concentration including multifamily is the right one to look at with all due respect thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well its a fair point as you know were not going to speak specifically on regulatory conversations but clearly we understand our business very well we also have a focus on looking at cre concentration as a much lesser number as we focus on relationship banking that is the mission of the new flagstar we are going to bank customers that have deposits at the bank and theyre full relationship deposits we have an opportunity here to significantly take advantage of market conditions and reduce indiscernible concentration putting into higher yielding loans higher margin businesses over time which are focused on relationship deposit lending that is a meaningful statement as we have no activity in the marketplace if you go back to when were doing billion billion a year in originations were running flat at to at best to stay flat so when the market does react to changes in interest rates and customers look for refinancing we have a golden opportunity here to take low yielding coupons off the books reduce ph cre concentration materially here and move that into higher yielding assets and obviously focus on our liquidity expectation but having a lower compensating balance to the asset is not the focus of the new flagstar its going to be well balanced towards relationship deposit lending that is the focus of the institution on a combined basis going forward and we think that given the activity last year as i indicated with down theres no activity in the market although the customer activity that we speak to theyre waiting on the sidelines and theyre going to react when they feel confident for the next to years of financing for us that somebody indicated taking fixed new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 rate loans some of loans go to the agency now but the agency has a huge appetite and when the customer feels prudent that its time to lock in the next to years of financing they will make that decision and we will work with our customers for balance sheet purposes and if its not a true customer relationship that will be a significant reduction to our cre concentration matthew breese q analyst stephens inc yeah over time i mean theres a lot of peer comp going on this quarter over time the cre concentration need to get to peer levels thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc look that is a huge business model of ours we have a great track we have great customers we have lots of relationships on the deposit side who are obviously uniquely different thats who we are and that goes back to our roots but ultimately were a new company were a commercial bank evolving from the monoline thrift were excited about the lines of businesses we have were excited about the opportunity of mortgage ecosystem were excited about what reggie davis is doing with his lines of businesses and we have choices and it can be based on a return on equity model which is very different in history where it was driven off of a monoline business which was multifamily cre so were going to reallocate those resources take advantage of market conditions and work with our customers we feel very strongly that just by the mere fact that the coupon was coming off the loans we have an opportunity to move a lot of assets at low coupon to make our balance sheet stronger and earnings profile better matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay last one from me the language here around being over billion feels far more urgent today than just a few months ago has something changed on the regulatory front in terms of overall standing or time line to be ready for new stress testing like i said a lot of peer comparison here if so can you give us some updated timeframe milestones i know you mentioned april submission in terms of being prepared for the first stress test thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc matt we are obviously were not going to speak specifically about regulatory conversations were a highly regulated institution in an industry thats highly regulated but the reality is that we do have an april submission weve adjusted our capital position significantly as well as the acl those are big steps as we forecast our submission to the reg yy thats an important milestone as john indicated were doing significant work on reg yy on balance sheet liquidity we went into the we catapulted into the billion club post liquidity crisis in march we were preparing for that last year so its ph totally organically and we an opportunity came and we thought it was a great opportunity for building out the conversion from a thrift model to a commercial bank model and we are in a unique benchmark now were in a different category theres eight of us that we benchmark to and we want to get those ratios in line to a group that makes sense going forward as we run our business i think the market will understand whats in front of us but more importantly as we build the new flagstar were excited with the team and the energy as they gravitate here to become be part of the indiscernible we made significant changes on the risk side significant changes on bringing people inhouse as a larger institution thats the journey that were focusing on here so it is fluid given the situation in respect to the timing because it became a little bit unexpected in march of this year as new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 we opted to be able to indiscernible and buy signature bank through receivership and now we have to make sure that were in place to be honorable of the fact that we are a category iv bank and thats a regulatory obligation matthew breese q analyst stephens inc ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so with the sales of the cre multifamily loans from signature indiscernible that basically now completed how does that impact the expenses from the loss sharing and then the fees some of that loan administration income that you had and how we think about that for john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so if you look at those transactions that hit the marketplace we expect that those loans will transfer off our servicing platform this quarter entirely so we will see some loan servicing income a little less than we saw in the fourth quarter well see some of that come in in the first quarter thats within the guide that we gave and then from a cost save perspective that some of that information once we get through the flagstar integration some of those cost saves are in that the noninterest expense walk that we put together in the slide deck so thats included in that number so from a quarteroverquarter perspective well see a decline fourth quarter to first quarter in income from the subservicing and then by the second quarter we expect that those loans will have transferred out so that we will have some cost saves that come out of that and then the income will disappear there bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just as a follow up i know there havent been many transactions and sounds like youre more focused on appraisals but did these sales potentially impact your decisions to add reserves for multifamily and office thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc this is a signature sale new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah no we no a lot of the information were getting a lot of it specifically comes from the appraisal were seeing in our portfolio we are looking at market any market indications that we can get our hands around and using that as well so were taking into account as much information as we can to develop the right qualitative framework for the for especially the office portfolio bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so those sales had no impact on the qualitative factor that youre mentioning john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah no from a we are looking at information in the marketplace but specific sales from a portfolio perspective would not be as important for us to look at as the individual appraised information and individual factors were getting on our books bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you operator our final question will come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for sneaking me in just two questions two important questions i think theres some confusion on this but did the dividend reduction have anything to do with your outlook for credit or was it more about looking peer like and adjusting for the new earnings run rate thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah great question let me be crystal clear on this this is razor focused on looking at the companys long termplan and being part of the new category iv banking institution and having a capital position as we grow it into a level that were in our peer group and clearly the dividend significantly increases that capital position in and beyond when you take all of the factors that we talked about between forward guidance and the dividend adjustment we get our cet1 to doubledigits that is primarily focused on the rationale there as well as thinking about the future growth of this company as a category iv bank and theres no question that this was a difficult decision as a firm but clearly necessary as we reestablish our capital allocation story jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc so really not its more about the latter its not about your outlook for credit is what youre saying thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 31jan2024 yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay tangible book value a little over maybe a simpleton question but do you expect tangible book value to grow in thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yeah john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes yes we do jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank
