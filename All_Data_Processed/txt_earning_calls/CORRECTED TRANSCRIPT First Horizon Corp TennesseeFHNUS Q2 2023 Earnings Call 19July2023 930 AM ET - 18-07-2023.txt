foundation contribution adjusted earnings added partially offset by our common dividend of the marktomarket on the securities portfolio and hedges drove a reduction on slide we outline the notable

the employee retention awards which remain in place following the termination other notable items include a million contribution to the first horizon foundation as well as a million derivative valuation adjustment related to prior visa class b sales on slide you can see that over the last year weve benefited from our asset sensitive position with a net interest margin expanding basis points yearoveryear the positive response from clients to our deposit campaign this quarter exceeded our expectations we brought in billion of new to bank funds from the more than customers which brings our ending deposit balances up yeartodate the positive deposit momentum modestly accelerated the timing of the increase in deposit betas however our net interest margin of continues to be very strong despite some moderation in the quarter as marginal funding costs have risen loan spreads have also widened out with new production spreads approximately basis points higher than we were seeing in the fourth quarter on slide you can see the success of our deposit campaign demonstrating the confidence our clients have in our franchise we grew periodend deposits by added over new clients to the bank and deepen relationships with almost of our existing clients our competitive offer and targeted client outreach generate historically strong acquisition with of balances coming from new to bank clients this deposit campaign provide a great opportunity to connect with our clients our bankers made proactive outreach calls and the clients who took advantage of the deepening offer increased their balances with us by on average mix shift continued into the second quarter with noninterest bearing balances declining from pandemic highs we are beginning to see signs and the pace of that mix shift is starting to slow down and dda balances are stabilizing in the second half of the quarter noninterest bearing balances at still comprise a higher proportion of total deposits today than prepandemic which was like a lot of banks we saw clients looking to maximize coverage on their deposits driving higher utilization of our collateralized repo suite product in addition to the billion of deposit growth we added million of repo balances which are incremental funding on slide we show the trends in our loan portfolio with loans up on average and at period end growth was diversified across our markets and portfolio types loans to mortgage companies grew million from first quarters seasonal lows this is a great business for us its our highest yielding business line and as others have pulled back in this space weve been able to deepen our relationships widen spreads and negotiate for more deposit business we also had growth in our cre portfolio which was primarily driven by fundups on existing loans primarily in our multifamily space we cover our fee income trends on slide overall fee income has remained stable for several quarters despite the macroeconomic headwinds impacting fixed income and mortgage we had million of increases in deferred compensation which is offset in expense we saw million of growth in other fees partially driven by higher treasury management fees due to the decline in noninterest bearing deposit and seasonal factors first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 on slide we review our expense trends we have maintained expense discipline across the company as evidenced in our results with adjusted expenses down million when you exclude the million increase in deferred compensation the advertising investments made this quarter were to support our client promotions brand awareness initiatives and client outreach programs other expenses declines include million of lower fraud losses from implementation of additional security solutions as well as lower franchise and realty tax expenses related to the disposal of properties turning to slide ill cover asset quality and reserves credit quality continues to be strong with nonperforming loans down million from the prior quarter and net chargeoffs remained near historic lows we had million of provision expense resulting in a reserve build of million supporting loan growth excluding loans to mortgage companies our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at flat to the prior period if the industry experiences a credit cycle we expect our portfolio to outperform due to the benefit of operating in attractive markets underwriting loans for all stages of the credit cycle and the granular diversification across industries and portfolio types turning to capital on slide our capital position is very strong with cet ratio of up basis points the series g conversion added basis points the termination fee added basis points net of the foundation contribution we accretively deployed basis points of capital into loans including million of lower risk loans to mortgage companies cet would still be well above the wellcapitalized threshold even adjusting for the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio on slide weve reaffirmed our full year guidance which remains unchanged from what we shared with you at investor day in early june as were all experiencing theres been a lot of volatility in the market expectations for interest rates our current outlook is for basis point rate hike in july and then rates flat through the rest of the year the positive deposit momentum modestly accelerated the timing of the increases in deposit betas and we remain asset sensitive we still expect our nii guidance to be in range with what we provided at investor day we continue to invest in our businesses and our expense outlook reflects the impact of those investments as well as the remaining retention awards moving into core expenses we are pleased with the momentum we had this quarter and are excited to continue to deliver on the strength of our franchise to wrap up on slide we are wellpositioned to capitalize on our diversified business model highly attractive markets and assetsensitive balance sheet as we continue to prudently manage capital and risk we are committed to delivering top quartile

regional bank and delivering enhanced returns to our shareholders first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 this concludes our prepared remarks carla well now open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jon arfstrom from rbc markets your line is now open please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey a question on deposit pricing expectations curious if you see them changing at all you alluded to a slowing noninterest bearing migration can you talk a little bit about that and then on your deposit campaign do you need to do more or is that essentially over at this point hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon thank you for the first question good to hear from you again jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah good morning hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee on the deposit campaign we did have a promo rate that ran through june that promo rate has expired and we have gone out with a new third quarter promo rate which is much more we do expect to continue to need to raise deposits in the industry but we dont expect to have to run the aggressive campaign we did in may and june we continue to believe that we are wellpositioned to grow our deposit base especially in deepening relationships with the new clients we brought on board as far as the dda we really saw in the second half of the quarter almost no migration coming out of the beginning of the year and especially in march and april we saw significant focus by clients on moving dda into interest bearing as they became aware of how lucrative that is and the outreach calls that we were all doing during that time as a result of the failures in the industry and so we believe the that were at now has been stable for second half of the quarter will remain stable as those are really operating accounts and theres not much more that can migrate into interest bearing first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very helpful and then can you touch on the pricing pressures on some of the larger depositors you touched on it at investor day but are you seeing that ease at all with some of the bigger deposit balances hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i would say in june we definitely towards the end of the quarter saw not the significant pressure we were seeing i think a lot of people settled down had changed banks already moved their money or starting to see a little bit more normal size bidding in the industry as well as clients not looking to move money as quickly as they were following the three bank failures d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee jon id add the following which is i think where youll see more pressure in the coming quarters not that its going to be easy anywhere but more on the commercial lending side is as you look at commercial lending transactions the entire industry is looking to deepen and broaden relationships youre seeing that in participations and club deals youre seeing that in syndicated transactions and i think youll see more of the pressure emerging on the commercial side in all likelihood in the back half of this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so youre saying tied to more tied to credit d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah yeah more than just a credit transaction its a relationship jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay ill step back in the queue thank you appreciate it d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator we have our next question from casey haire from jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah great thanks good morning guys so just maybe following up on some of jons questioning on it sounds like the dda is near bottom which is great i was wondering is there a ceiling on cds as a percentage of mix i know you guys are stepping away from the promotion but just wondering how much cds you can make of the deposit franchise first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee casey were getting a little bit of feedback but i think you asked is there a ceiling on cds as to what were targeting in our portfolio and i would say i think were still significantly underweighted in cds versus our peers and i look back at q1 and where we grew in q2 so i think we still have a lot more room that we could grow cds if we aggressively were to price there i would tell you in the quarter cds were not our leading we really technical difficulty a lot of money market funds was where we saw a lot of the ph new to client money come in casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then just following up any updated thoughts on where cumulative deposit beta apologies if i missed this where cumulative deposit beta settles hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee in investor day we said that we thought our cumulative deposit betas would be around i think thats still a good range i think well look at a depending on what the rate environment is technical difficulty things that i mentioned in my comments i do believe that we accelerated our deposit betas this quarter as a result of our deposit gathering campaign and so future rate hikes do not require us to reprice our book the way we would have had to in the past i think we just accelerated that casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah we gave this technical difficulty at investor day and i think were still in that range casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay excellent and just lastly on the expense front up yearoveryear tracking a little bit below your to guide for the year just wondering if thats conservative or is there going to be more expense pressure heavier expense pressure in the back half hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee i think thats realistic i think one of the big things we need to add back is we have million of retention coming back into operating that was previously charged to the merger center which is a big part of it and we also have some hiring that we need to do coming out of just being a little bit low thinking that we were going to close on a merger shortly and ph there are some hiring that we need to do back significant portions but just some pockets that we need to backfill first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee and the third one is as we mentioned in investor day we are so the third one is we are starting to invest in our technology and that takes a quarter or two to come up technical difficulty we start to see some of that really hit our run rate in fourth quarter with the full run rate impact in as we invest million to million in our technology platforms over the next three years casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks casey operator our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead when youre ready michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to touch on this quarters loan growth i think if im doing the math right the guide was reiterated but this quarter was obviously much stronger than i think many of us were anticipating does that imply kind of a shrinkage in the back half of the year or is the guidance conservative just trying to kind of square the guidance and then maybe if you could touch on the warehouse looks like one of your larger competitors got out of the space just want to see what the potential benefit to you all would be thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah michael this is bryan ill start we think that loan growth will probably flatten out some in the back half of the year you had some continued pullthrough of pipelines in the residential mortgage you mentioned mortgage warehouse lending there has been some changes in the competitive landscape there and weve seen some opportunities both on the pricing and the line utilization side to pick up some very nice relationships there and broadly speaking we saw utilization in commercial real estate as we saw fundup of some existing projects that were done many many quarters ago so we think that will start to level out we think clearly the positive trends we saw in deposits and deposit gathering positioned us well to support our customer needs and to grow the franchise attractively and well take advantage of those opportunities but our expectation for loan growth over the full year is it flattens out some in the back half of this year first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great and then maybe just switching to the fixed income business i think this is the lowest quarter of revenue that i have at least in my model going back many many years can you just give us an update on kind of the competitive positioning of that business and is this kind of a inflection point quarter are we going to get to some sort of inflection point as the fed hits terminal rates here in the next couple of months just want to get some updates there thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah look its been a series of very tough quarters in that business and average daily revenue has suffered as a result were still very confident in our ability to serve our customers in a very unique way where were very uniquely positioned with a broad customer base a huge distribution model and were very confident that when we do reach terminal rates and we start to see some transition and steepening of the yield curve were likely to see that business recover nicely weve always described it as somewhat countercyclical and we expect it will continue to do that in the meantime our teams are working very very hard to deliver value through other channels portfolio advisory asset management research things of that nature and were going to control cost and well be positioned for the turn when it comes michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right great thanks for taking my question d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee sure thank you michael operator we have our next question from brady gailey from kbw please go ahead when youre ready michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning brady hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the initial deposit promotion is over i think you said it wrapped up june the 30th and then you mentioned there was a new deposit promo going on but at lower rates what is the new kind of pricing of deposits for this quarter hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee since money market kind of been the one that weve had the most success with ill do that one we were at for money markets and starting july were now at so weve decreased basis points there and i would say that thats pretty directionally similar for our other products as well brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and the loantodeposit ratio ticked down a little bit in the second quarter its now at kind of a mid90 range is there a goal that you would like to see that ratio at or are you actively trying to get that ratio lower d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee brady we dont have a goal around that were mindful that we have to fund our loans with deposits and our securities portfolio we think its useful to look at both loans and securities portfolios because they both have to be funded in a similar fashion we are mindful that we dont want that ratio to get too high were not uncomfortable with where it is and our outlook and our ability to gather deposits doesnt give us any concern that were going to be overly constrained by our loantodeposit ratio were not going to let it get wildly out of ground but right now were very comfortable with how its positioned brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then finally for me just an update on the share buyback if you look at your common equity tier indiscernible finish the year around thats a lot higher than your goal of to is there any update on the willingness to consider a share buyback especially with the stock at ph of tangible d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i dont have any new information we still have authorization in the buyback stock we believe that right now capital provides a really nice degree of optionality we think its important to see how this economic environment plays out and we like being positioned with a strong capital base we have plenty of opportunity to deploy it and capital repatriation whether its dividend andor buyback but in the meantime were going to use it to support our customers and look at opportunities to grow the balance sheet where appropriate brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks guys first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question comes from brody preston from ubs please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask it seems like the interest bearing deposit growth was a little bit back half weighted when comparing the period end and the average and so i just wanted to maybe ask on the spot rate of the interest bearing deposit cost do you happen to have what that is at quarter end d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah no doubt it was back half weighted with the termination in early may we started the program in the back half of may our spot rate at the end of the quarter would run in about brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee allin cost of deposit brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then hope just within the net interest income guide i guess how much of the i think you were just a little bit below the low end of the guide but you maintained and i know you changed the forward curve outlook that you were using as it evolved so i just wanted to kind of ask how much did the removal of the i think you had a couple cuts a handful of cuts in the back half of the year kind of baked into the previous guidance how much did the removal of those cuts add to the net interest income guidance hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah we did miss our guidance just slightly and thats all on deposit growth we set up an investor day on june and everyone thought we were going to have deposit runoff and we said no were seeing deposit momentum first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 we didnt expect june to be a better month than may at that point and we were really really excited to see how strong june came in which did give us higher beta and a little lower net interest margin but i will mention the rate were paying for deposits is paying off wholesale funding so it is positive to our overall net interest margin over the horizon as we pay down wholesale funding as it matures and continue to use client deposits as our primary way to fund our balance sheet when we look at the way the rate curve has moved bringing a rate increase earlier in the year versus two decreases later in the year is very positive to our margin since were asset sensitive but it does help to offset the increased deposit rates we have so i believe were still in range with all three of those offsetting brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then i wanted to ask one just on the fixed rate loan portfolio do you happen to know what the dollar amount of fixed rate loans is thats repricing over the next months and do you know what the current yield on those loans that our repricing is hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee brody i dont know the yield on those i can try to get them and have investor relations get back to you at the end of the day i dont have that but it is about billion that we have repricing in the next months brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and what are current origination yields im sorry if you mentioned that and i missed it hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee weve seen our spread significantly widen out to about to spreads to is what were seeing new originations at brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then last one for me just within the afs portfolio do you happen to know what the effective duration is of that portfolio and then i guess within that duration calculation do you know what conditional prepayment rate you guys are using to come up with that duration hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah our effective duration is ph and then we assume a ph prepayment rate brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thank you very much for taking my questions i appreciate it d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 thank you operator our next question is from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared just a couple of questions here the excess liquidity that was generated in the second quarter looks like its sitting in cash right now just curious what the use of that liquidity is going to be are you going to pay down some borrowings with that is that going to go into the bond books any color we can get on that hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee we plan to pay down our borrowings on that we had laddered out our borrowings and the deposits came in a little bit quicker so it wasnt intentional to have that much cash at the fed but as fhlb matures our debt we will pay it off with that excess funds timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then the it sounds like youre going to continue building liquidity throughout the rest of the year is that going to be the strategy there as well or could we see some additional layering into the bond book hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee at this time we have no intention of putting any additional securities on the books our intention is to improve our liquidity position as you said and as bryan said earlier use our strong capital position and liquidity we generate to be there for our clients and customers during this time and support our loan growth that we still we have moderating loan growth in the back half of the year but still loan growth d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee in fact our expectation is at the securities portfolio because were making very limited reinvestment theyll continue to trend down timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you and then maybe from a bigger picture standpoint the deposit growth that you generated in the second quarter can you just talk about kind of the geographic diversity there and how that plays into the broader strategy as a standalone company once again as kind of the nearterm strategy to further penetrate ph iberiabank markets kind of with a more broad product offering is it on working to gain market share in tennessee namely nashville kind of all of the above maybe just give a sense on how youre thinking about geographic strategy here d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 yeah the breakdown if i recall the numbers it was about of the deposit growth was in the state of tennessee and was out and so its fairly broadbased and diverse we think that as we look at the next several quarters were realizing the benefits of the promise of the iberiabank first horizon merger vehicles we think we have a great opportunity to continue to grow our presence in these very attractive higher growth markets that were in all across the south and one of the areas of emphasis for us will be in the coming quarters will be how we continue to build out that retail presence and retail focus and what would been the legacy iberiabank markets so we see there being a huge opportunity for us to capitalize on a unique business model and value proposition for our customers at the same time drive attractive deposit growth and the ability to serve our customers more broadly in these higher growth markets timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead when youre ready anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone this is anthony elian on for steve my first question at investor day last month you indicated that you were able to retain nearly of associates through the first quarter of this year while waiting for the td deal to move forward what did banker retention look like in the second quarter and since investor day and are there any notable changes from the retention statistics you provided at investor day d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no no notable changes our banker and client retention have continued to be very very good and were encouraged with the excitement enthusiasm we see in both groups our associates our bankers as well as our clients so our retention has been good and i havent seen the final numbers but my best estimate would be that its probably improved from what you saw in the first quarter anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the deposit gathering promotion i guess from a high level why did you feel like you needed to be aggressive with engaging in deposit gathering promotions not just from existing clients but also from new to bank clients d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 well couple of thoughts clearly we had maybe one of the more unique situations in midapril with the termination excuse me midmay with the termination of the merger and we wanted to do a couple of things one that was a period where there was an awful lot in play and we all know that the deposit base in the us has been volatile and contracting so one we wanted to be very wellpositioned to not only to protect the home field but to be aggressive and front footed in terms of demonstrating our commitment to the markets that we serve it was a great opportunity to get our bankers on the phone talking to customers having a positive conversation about first horizon how were positioned what were looking to do over the foreseeable future and how we continue to be committed to serving them and their needs and then thirdly hope mentioned wholesale funds and sort of the alternative wholesale funds even at the same cost you certainly get a relationship benefit when you deal with a client versus a federal home loan bank borrowing so we looked at it said it was a appropriate period to say were going to reset were going to draw a line under the termination of the merger were going to get very front footed were going to demonstrate our commitments to customers our marketplace and our commitment to delivering on the value of the first horizon model anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and my last question of the billion deposits you added in the second quarter from the campaign how much would you say is sticky and how does this break down into the billion from new clients and the billion deposits from existing clients thank you hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee new to bank clients we saw of that in consumer and of that in commercial and on the deepening relationships it was consumer commercial we see every one of these as an opportunity to introduce new clients to the first horizon franchise and so now that we have a deposit relationship with them were calling on them and trying to deepen relationships in other spaces so we are hoping that the majority of these will be sticky were not seeing them as transitional deposits were reaching out to these clients and trying to build relationships with every single one of them we have more clients this quarter than we had before and we see that as an opportunity to continue to grow relationships with them and create more profitability d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so the real opportunity in our view which is we recognize that you attract customers and new customers in any deposit campaign principally with rate but it is an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to service and deepening and if you look at the deposit growth we had with our existing customer base roughly billion billion my recollection is right something like of that was with our primary customer base something like that so what we want to do is take the opportunity we have a locked in period here and well take the opportunity to deepen the relationship broaden the relationship with these customers the new customers the if i remember the numbers right it was about were retail and about plus were were commercial so thats a great opportunity for us to broaden relationship and we have said about doing that and i expect well have very good results with it anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc first

or substandard however you look at it and how you think that may play out in the quarters ahead susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah thanks chris we had a little bit of additional downgrades into indiscernible but it was very moderate and its something that we typically do see as you know in second quarter were getting yearend financials in compliance were still very very pleased with the overall asset quality for the portfolio so in terms of total classified indiscernible at the end of the quarter and nonaccruals at as hope pointed out we actually had a decrease in our nonaccrual loan balances so obviously were watching it carefully with whats going on in the economy rising interest rates but as we talked to our bankers and clients we feel like that in many cases borrowers are getting used to this environment first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 theyre adjusting businesses or being able to pass along increases in prices so again we believe were well positioned but were watching it carefully and doing the appropriate servicing and monitoring that we need to do and continue to be diligent in initial underwriting as well d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee its kind of interesting when you talk to our bankers and the customers chris this expected recession thats always six months off and just continues to roll it still feels like customers borrowers are in a pretty good place as susan said theyve adjusted very well to higher rates and the changing dynamics around inflation and as she said paying an awful lot of attention to grading and understanding how our borrowers are doing but at the end of the day things still feel relatively good at this point christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you for that and susan would there be any possible reserve release as the unfunded commitments come down is that a possibility susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee firstly obviously we have to reevaluate it every quarter chris in terms of looking at what growth weve had and balances in unfunded things like whats going on in the economy at this point i feel like the reserve is where it needs to be
