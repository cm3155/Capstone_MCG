reconciliation of each nongaap financial measure to the nearest comparable gaap financial measure as a reminder this conference call is being recorded i will now turn the conference call over to mr edward wehmer edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi everybody welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call and thanks for dialing in with me as always are dave dykstra dave stoehr our cfo kate boege our general counsel tim crane our president and rich murphy our vice chairman in charge of credit wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 we have the same format as usual where im going to give some general comments regarding our results ill turn it over to dave dykstra for more detailed analysis other income and other expenses and taxes back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future of course some time for questions and given all that brought to the table i think wintrust really had a remarkable year pretax preprovision earnings increased which exceeded our 10year cagr which stood at not too shabby i know that we may not have beaten the analyst estimates this quarter for ppp income were much closer than you think considering the one time theres a million and a million of foregone income when we made the decision to keep of mortgage production on our books more on this later cecl required huge provisions million versus million in an increase of million meanwhile net chargeoffs in were million million less than the previous year npls and npas as percent of loans and assets respectively reached basis points lower than last year last year in and of itself was an excellent credit year they closed the year at basis points and basis points respectively one would think there was even a crisis going on that i have to write a nice note to moodys fasb and aicpa and thank them for putting cecl in when they did asset deposits and loan growth have all exceeded 10year averages assets grew versus a cagr over years loans grew versus a cagr and deposits during the year versus a cagr we now have over billion in assets again mortgage area hit the cover off the ball by design we hope it would do that because when rates go low we use the mortgages to cover so we can catch up on the margin side and whats most amazing is we accomplished this really by working remotely through the most part taking people and flipping to remote and being able to accomplish what we did our asset growth what we did with ppp and the like is just incredible to me incredible it just really is incredible the entire wintrust team showed great strategic ability and it can do attitude that is unsurpassed couldnt be prouder of them and i told our board this and truly was i mean this it really continues to be our finest hour on to some earnings statistics million for the year down from the fourth quarter but up sorry from the third quarter but up from the same time last year earnings per share were down from the first quarter or from the third quarter and from the fourth quarter last year yeartodate we made million at a per share down mostly because of the huge cecl provision we had to take other than that were in pretty good shape pretax preprovision of million or million yeartodate was up over over the same period last year and over the prior year net interest margin of was down basis points however the net interest income was up million as we had great loan growth in spite of the fact that it didnt look like it but well get into that in a second because of the first levels of ppp loans trying to get repaid or forgiven say we had loans breakeven but really core loans were up nicely during the period ill talk about that in a second roe at for the quarter for the year ph roe was for the year return on tangible equity for the full year overhead ratio was basis points thats compared to basis points last quarter basis points a year before basis points yeartodate we would have probably been a lot lower had we not had the onetimers et cetera but i think we feel pretty good about where we are in that regard ill talk about it in a second tangible book value again grew nicely during the year and again as we go through all the time thats one of our primary motivators is our drivers is earnings growth tangible book value growth and asset growth wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 the margin was again affected by excess liquidity on our balance sheet we began to do a number of things to improve the nii and nim some of these are listed below note that our goal is to maintain at a interest rate sensitivity position throughout these efforts our goal is to maintain a gaap of to in other words we have to stay disciplined here and not go along and lock in the margin at these goofy rates our loan pipelines remain consistently strong in all facets of the business we made a decision during the quarter to keep of mortgage production on our books it really beats buying mortgage backs in this market this did affect earnings in the quarter as we held actually million on our books in q4 theres an to 12month breakeven point on holding versus selling in that we have to take all the expenses related to the production up front and well get it back in the margin which is probably a good thing but lets see we also pulled million of mortgages from ginnie mae that were always on our books indiscernible receive the earnings earnings were going to these security holders and not us we retained the guarantee but earned the income so earning asset growth was actually when youre thinking of it earning asset loan growth was actually up over million during the quarter most of the growth took place towards the end of the quarter so we have a really good head start going forward into this year we commenced investing on some liquidity assets of a longer duration currently aggregate duration of our liquidity portfolio is years so close to five to sixyear duration we usually operate with so we have some room to do some accretive investing without messing up the desired gaap goals we also i know weve been taking applications for ppp part for over days currently we have applications in the process of over billion have already been submitted to the sba for approval indiscernible these loans approximate million they amortize over the life of the loans to at least through december of this year average ticket size of these loans is the mean size is we really beat everybody in the market by almost days and our decks are pretty clear right now weve got this down and we hope to add more to this portfolio not just because we need it but to help our clients out there who need this to get through the last throngs of this current problem or crisis apparently not really the margin but on the earning asset front we did complete one round of branch retail round one of our branch retail rationalization approach we sold three southwestern wisconsin branches that is not in our prime footprint and we recorded a small gain approximately million in quarter two we also announced plans to close initial branches and took a million charge this quarter related to the closings these branches were all acquired over the years ph and were probably needed due to not to be needed due to proximity to other wintrust locations so saving us probably million plus or minus a year it should also be noted that were down over positions in retail due to attrition weve now replaced the staff that left we believe there to be a like amount of additional excess capacity in our existing footprint due to continued use of online services really brought about by the pandemic these additional savings will offset the cost of branches currently on the drawing board for and im just a little bit worried that were much bigger now and when we do when life does get back to normal we really dont want to we want to keep our service level enhanced we dont want to bite to the bone right now so well see where we go with it we always continue to look for other additional efficiencies in the market also in quarter four we started a stock purchase program acquiring almost  in the quarter able to do this wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 in an average price that made the acquisition accretive to both earnings and tangible book value well continue to monitor for additional opportunities on the other income side not to take daves thunder but the mortgage area hit the cover off the ball all year fourth quarter as mentioned indicated the start of our program were booking of production on our books hurts current earnings but will be profitable over the long run wealth management also had a good year especially a good fourth quarter that we can build on going forward total assets under administration surpassed billion billion to be exact of growth growth of billion in the quarter rebounding markets help but the majority of the growth was from new accounts bodes well for the future on the balance sheet front assets grew billion the average earning assets were up million loans as we said earlier without ppp were up million in all facets of the business if you add back the ginnie maes we bought back really the hit on the books were made earning closer to ph million of earning asset growth we had the majority of which took place as i mentioned in the last part of the quarter really by almost million plus the buyback of the ginnies so this really holds million of average versus even well quarterend in the fourth quarter so again thats a number plus the ginnies that we started earning on in this quarter that bodes pretty well deposits were up billion thats after the repayment of million of high plus institutional money we returned during the quarter so again we continue to grow through the cycle loantodeposit ratio is down from as the first round first two rounds of ppp continue to pay off thats a good thing loantodeposits loans and deposits as i mentioned loan growth was good across the board and we feel good but our pipelines are strong we feel very good about where we are right now and as mentioned deposit growth was extraordinary throughout the quarter and the year and we hope to continue that growth because that really is the franchise value of the company on the credit side we discussed credit at the beginning of the presentation needless to say the numbers which were good to begin with have gotten even better the pretty low provision we took of million is not really a reserve release in my opinion based on economic factors but rather an indication of overall portfolio improvement through hard work of our credit team million of loans were upgraded and million of nonaccruals paid off this was accomplished through portfolio sales use of feds main street lending product successful execution of lending exit strategies we continue to cull the portfolio for cracks if you understand that your first loss is your best loss we always look good on recovery ill now turn the call over to dave whos going to provide some additional detail on other income expenses and taxes dave david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp all right thanks ed as usual ill briefly touch on the significant noninterest income and noninterest expense sections that had changes from the prior quarter starting with the net interest income section our wealth management revenue increased million to million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter of and up from million wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 recorded in the yearago quarter this revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing of a portion of our managed asset accounts mortgage banking revenue as ed referred to was seasonally strong due to the continuing low interest rate environment but declined or million to million in the fourth quarter from the record level of million posted in the prior quarter and was up a strong from the million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year the company originated approximately billion of mortgage loans for sale in the fourth quarter a record up from approximately billion in the prior quarter and up substantially from the billion of loans that we originated for sale in the fourth quarter of last year the decline in the categorys revenue from the prior quarter resulted from first a decrease in the value of the mortgage servicing rights related to the fair value model assumptions of million in the fourth quarter as compared to a decrease of million in the prior quarter and a drop of approximately billion in the pipeline of mortgages being originated for sale including a reduction of approximately million that the company has earmarked to be originated and held for investment during the first quarter of the company is required to record the value of the mortgagerelated derivatives related to loans in the pipeline at quarter end that are estimated to close and to be sold as such when the pipeline of the loans declines the revenue declines accordingly similarly if the pipelines of loans for sale increases then we would see associated increases in net revenue so the reduction of the pipelines like million sacrifices revenue in the current quarter and as ed mentioned that revenue should be recognized through net interest income going forward likewise we retained million of mortgage loans on our balance sheet in the fourth quarter and we also sacrificed the revenue on those loans in the current quarter but again should recognize the revenue through the margin going forward so approximately million that we kept on the books and million that was in the pipeline that we sacrificed the revenue on the current quarter for the benefit of future quarters while the mortgage revenue declined it remains a very strong quarter for our mortgage banking business we currently expect originations in the first quarter to be very strong again due to the continuation of the refinance activity and a strong committed pipeline table of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation of all the components of the origination volumes the mortgage servicing right capitalization servicing cost et cetera but again a record quarter in total we recorded or originated billion of loans that closed either for sale or that we kept on our balance sheet other noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter up approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter the primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category included of higher swap fee revenue and million of higher income investments and partnerships which are primarily related to sbic investments to support cra purposes additionally boli income was up approximately million from the third quarter primarily as a result of million of higher earnings on boli investments that support deferred compensation benefit plans which were positively impacted by the equity market returns and also a net million debt benefit that we recorded during the quarter i should note that the million of increase related to the deferred compensation plan would show a similar increase in expenses so the amounts in essence offset each other between the other income and the compensation expense by million wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 turning to the noninterest expense categories noninterest expenses totaled million for the fourth quarter up approximately million or from the million recorded in the prior quarter there are a handful of categories that account for the increase that i will focus on first the salary employee benefits expense category increased approximately million in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter the salary expense component of that category was up approximately million the primary cause of the increase related to increased staffing to support the overall increase in mortgage originations and technology related staffing to support our ongoing development of enhanced digital products and capabilities the reported amounts also saw the increase in the deferred compensation expense of a net million that was impacted by the boli returns that i previously discussed turning to commissions and incentive comp that category is up million in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter with that change being driven largely by the additional commissions related to the higher amount of closed mortgages and slightly higher wealth management brokerage trading activity as well as a little bit of higher incentive compensation expense recorded in the fourth quarter you have to remember that the commissions expense on mortgages are paid when the mortgage loan is closed and we had record closings in the current quarter that exceeded the prior quarter where its revenue is also recorded on the pipelines so a little bit of a disconnect there but higher commissions due to higher closings offsetting the aforementioned increases in employee benefits was a decrease in employee benefits of approximately from the prior quarter due to a slight decrease in employee insurance claims and a slightly lower level of payroll taxes equipment expense totaled million in the fourth quarter an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter total of million the increase was due to increased software licensing expenses including some increases related to online mortgage usage ppp loan servicing enhancements network upgrades to support our growth and digital enhancements and various other software upgrades as well as the writeoff of certain software systems that had been retired early as a result of our implementation of certain new systems we continue to invest in software and technology to enhance our customer delivery system and products as well as invest in our systems to support our continued growth occupancy expense totaled million on the fourth quarter increasing million the increase was due to the million impairment charge associated with the planned closures of the branches that ed referred to increased real estate tax assessments from the prior quarter and a higher level of utility charges advertising and marketing expenses increased by million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter this was primarily related to increased digital advertising campaigns and community impact and sports sponsorship spending as various communitybased sports venues have begun to increase their events again in summary if you look at this and add up the components there was roughly million of the increase relates to mortgage activity including million of an additional earnout on the mortgage acquisitions we had and roughly million of increased salary and benefit costs for the record level of mortgage closings during the quarter so we would expect that to decrease in the future quarters as the pipelines are down and we believe we wont have any significant additional contingent consideration going forward and we had the million of branch closures so between those items thats roughly 12plus million dollars of expenses that were related to the mortgage andor branch closures that we would expect to decline in the future quarters wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 so other than those expense categories no other expense categories had any significant change from the amounts recorded in the third quarter ed mentioned that our net overhead ratio was was up slightly from the third quarter but on a yeartodate basis the net overhead ratio was and down basis points from the recorded in and with that i will throw the discussion back over to ed edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you dave was a pretty interesting and challenging year to say the least in some respects its a very rewarding year that being said it would be nice to return to some degree of normalcy we always in the company our mascot is sisyphus and remember what sisyphus i think i said this before on earlier calls that he pushed the rock up the hill every day and every night it would fall down and he had to push it up the next day on every year i tell everybody listen for the rock falling down we got to push it back up were well on our way of pushing it up this year i think were very well positioned to start in a very good place we have to take what the market gives us and we need to grow through this low interest rate period invest in a way that maintains an above normal interest rate sensitivity position maintains our always conservative credit standards earlier we discussed all levers were pulling to increase earnings and the margin loan pipelines remain strong and ppp round three give us an unexpected lift for the year we continue to cull the portfolio for problem credits to improve on our already stellar credit statistics we will also continue to find other costsaving ideas however were always going to invest in the business not to do so would be absolutely fatal capital levels remain at more than adequate levels the expansion front a number of new branches planned for the next months into areas we do not currently serve on the acquisition front we continue to search out deals in all areas of our business the recent rebound in our stock price we would now have currency to use in deals remember how much we abhor dilution so its nice to get a little bit of currency back you can be assured of our consistent conservative approach on potential deals i wanted to end by saying marks our 30th year in business on december we will hit the 30year anniversary opening our first bank weve come a long way from the card tables and beer square feet and employees but weve never lost sight of our basic operating principles this has served us well its kind of funny i think theres a reasonable chance that we could hit billion in years i can assure you that years ago this was never in our wildest dreams but its kind of cool if you think about it as always you can be assured of our best efforts we appreciate your support now we can go over to questions if there are any out there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi arf how are you doing jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good doing well doing well a question on the decision to put some mortgages on the balance sheet can you just im not critical of it but talk a little bit about that decision strategically why you did it what youre putting on the balance sheet and how far you want to take that edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well were going to stay within that to gaap position that we always desire but i dont want to go out and buy a bunch of mortgage backs at when i can get keep jumbo loans on the books at to i know its got a payback of call it a year but why not we have to put this liquidity to work these are very good deals the returns are pretty good on them we probably gave up between the that we booked this quarter next quarter gave up probably million in revenue ph to get your production margin or will be more than that be a lot more at million maybe million million were going to add in additional revenue this quarter certainly would have kept everybody happy on the ppp front but it just makes sense that rather than go out and do it that way we can book them and put them in the margin and make some money as opposed to buying mortgage backs at half the price jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and jon as ed mentioned were targeting maybe of our production so it hurts a little bit but were not doing like half of our production but it still provides a longterm benefit and an earning lever to use going forward although it sacrifices current quarter revenue wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right okay and then dave just sticking on mortgage i know this kind of comes up every quarter but talk a little bit about maybe your nearterm expectations for volumes and maybe this matters more than ever but just remind us of your ability to accordion some of the mortgage expenses if volumes do really continue to come down in and is that something we should be concerned about for the bottom line thanks david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah so well have to see where applications come in the pipelines are down billion so if you look at that and say between investments and closings we did billion well probably be billion plus or minus as far as ph reduction in the first quarter and then quite frankly we have to see what the spring buying season is like second quarter could be more than but i think all in including investments and for sale billion plus or minus is reasonable so we still think its going to be a strong quarter a lot of the increase in the salaries expense related to temporary and contract workers so that goes to your accordion those can go up and down rather quickly and so i think we can accordion the expenses well and we manage for that were focused on that unfortunately the pipeline and the production has been strong recently so we havent had to do this its more of an issue of do we have enough people to process record volumes of production and so we added this quarter to it because we did have record production volume quarter and record ph accordion we do think we can ph accordion well we do think the volume will be strong in the first quarter not quite as strong as billion allin closings we did this quarter but still historically a very strong quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay all right thanks a lot guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens your line is now open edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi terry terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yes can you hear me edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp now we can hear you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay sorry about that little mute button my apologies maybe start with the net interest margin could you just talk about the outlook for the margin with and without kind of ppp fees and then a couple of times youve mentioned that to 30basispoint margin expansion as you kind of redeploy that excess liquidity and just over the next months the opportunity to achieve that nim expansion through that event edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well itll depend really on loan growth and deposit well deposit costs still have room to come down thats going to happen the loan growth is going to happen but what it really depends on is we figure we can put billion to billion worth of work in the investment portfolio so were going to lag that in though because rates seem like theyre going up and why put it all on now why not hedge or bet a little i mean i think theyll go up before they go down so i think you got to deal with those numbers we gave you it might be a little bit more staccato than youd like but well take advantage what the market gives us and i think that the next quarter you should start seeing some benefit of it depending on where libor goes we think well be in pretty good shape but i cant give you more than that just because i gave you all the tools the levers were pulling just a timing issue and we gave you the ranges of where its going to come but i dont want to be totally specific because its all a function of where market rates are where we think theyre going and we dont want to lock in this margin but we do want to leave room for expansion so like today i think we put about million to work and thats a fair number in the first quarter and itll go to work in the first quarter of the billion we think we have to play within the investment portfolio and well see where it goes from there dave you got any other comment on that david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah the thing i would say terry is that i think the margins basically bottomed out though it went down a few basis points this quarter but we have significant liquidity come in again so that youre earning basis points or basis points on so barring additional significant liquidity coming in which i think might have a little pressure if that happens but we think the margins really bottomed out and the margin goes up from here as we do the investments that ed talked about and the new ppp loans will come in to help offset the runoff of the old ppp loans and i think were in pretty good shape and i think the margin has really bottomed out here and barring some big swing in the curve environment that would be negative to us if the curve flattened even more and went inverted but we dont expect that we think the margins bottomed out and we have lots of lever i think thats one of the great stories that we have here is we have a lot of liquidity to put to use and theres an earnings lever there and we believe we bottomed out and now its just trying to time how and when to put liquidity to work terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 thank you and then just as a followup question the advertising and marketing costs lower this year because of just the pandemic and i believe earlier you mentioned stadium sporting events starting to open up again edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc could you just talk about kind of your thoughts for on that line i dont want to be surprised assuming they go back to more normal levels which a year ago in the fourth quarter was million edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah well it just all depends on when people are allowed back in stadiums we cut deals said no one was in the stadium we shouldnt have to pay as much we pay in the past on tickets and ticket issues and the like but with the onset of the being able to go get the shots i think by june or july were going to have people in there so i dont know if its going to be as high as it was in our highest years we are still obligated to pay it if it is but i just dont think youre going to have fans in the stands for half the year in which case itll be less what can i say i mean just follow the baseball baseball is our biggest cost and if there arent fans in the stands we dont have to pay as much and basketball the same thing we have northwestern marquette and depaul and with no fans in the stands we dont have to pay as much so because theyre playing itll be more than last year but less than our high points does that make sense terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc understood yes appreciate that thanks guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks terry operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning david i just want to go back to the question on the mortgages you put on the balance sheet ive seen some of your broader peers do similar strategies they bought loans out of the warehouse im wondering if you could speak to the credit characteristics of these loans that have been put on indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 why dont we let murph do that richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah chris as youd probably have seen from other banks right now on credit quality through our bank and also through our warehouse customers has really never been better i mean if you look at average ph empirical scores i mean things the max ph obviously got tighter over the last number of years but what were seeing right now is just outstanding credit quality so i feel very good about holding these on our balance sheet christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc are these conforming are these some sort of you said theyre jumbo are they prime are they sort of like alta characteristics to them richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp no these are all prime jumbos christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay cool and then just another question tying growth into capital i guess i was positively surprised you bought back stock in the quarter maybe you could speak to expectations going forward ive always kind of viewed yourselves as more optimized capital versus massive excess but interested in your thoughts with the pandemic easing a bit thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well we really like we dont like dilution at all we love the accretive aspects of what weve done todate i mean being able to buy below tangible book value and in terms of helping earnings it all worked but now the stock price is up its a little tougher but you never know with whats going on in the world ph if were down again were prepared to buy it back we hate dilution we abhor dilution we want to be accretive so as long as it makes good sense well buy some we still have some capacity to buy now on the existing authority dave how much do we have david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yes so our initial authority was million and we bought back million todate in the first quarter of we did million and then in the fourth quarter of we did million so a total of million out of that program so we have million left that we could do but as ed said we tried to be opportunistic and buy it generally our average price on this in the fourth quarter was a share so well monitor the price well look at what other opportunities are out there for capital deployment as far as the growth and the like and play it by ear wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then maybe one more if i could obviously theres a big merger in the midwest with huntington and tcf obviously tcf chicago is a little bit different but interested in any potential opportunities from dislocation either from that or from fifth thirds deal a couple of years back thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp oh dislocate we love it when that happens dislocation is our middle name with the huntington deal tcf was not that really that strong in chicago with most of their locations being in grocery stores not really our cup of tea recall tcf was a years ago was the fee king of the world and we dont play that game so really those customers are welcome in our place but i dont think theyll care its just going to be a product sort of thing and well see where that goes the other side the disruption caused by fifth third buying mb is still ongoing and weve hired a number of their bankers and were getting good business from them we actually started a new currency division thats coming from them its a business indirectly and has well very directly in our previous group dave and murph and i were all involved with we were the largest in the chicago fed district in terms of handling these guys when mb bought corus it was not they took it now fifth third didnt want it so that business is up for grabs we hired good people from them very profitable business so its not just the business you pick up its the lines of business you can pick up too which is kind of interesting so disruption is good theres recently announced billion local bank in a market we compete being bought by a downstate illinois bank thatll be an opportunity for us so we love the disruption we love to take advantage of it right now were excited about our prospects in the ppp world we really have the way our system works opening up really before anybody else in the market with flawless execution it really goes from soup to nuts very quickly actually were seeing a lessened demand from our customers now trying to outreach the prospects and to well weve always done for low to moderates the low to moderate side of the equation were running local workshops to where people come in and actually do their applications with a proctor kind of there to answer questions and help them get through it but we think that the halo effect from the previous ppp and hopefully will carry over into this one and our decks are pretty well cleared because of the efficiency and the hard work of our people getting them cleared its been awesome so theres a lot of disruption a lot of opportunity in the market as i said our pipelines are extremely full its coming from someplace were not making it up its not expansion just by it so we continue to take business from our competitors christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks a lot for the color appreciate it operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of nathan race from piper sandler your line is now open wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co just going back to that last point ed on ppp i guess with the third round opening up here recently what are your expectations in terms of volumes coming out of that over the next quarter or two edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well were already at what i say billion i think that theres still some room there if it goes to billion or billion it gets kind of funky where we dont really open it up in general because of the fraud aspects i think knowing your customer is important we have so many on the prospect list so that we do know for one in one shape or form or another that were now in the outreach were calling people and ask them about it for the prospects and existing customers we think are eligible who havent taken advantage of it prospects and certainly the low to mods were working very hard on those so i would think we could be anywhere between billion to billion if were at billion now i think billion billion on the low side billion on the high side will be a good number just depends how long it goes and if they restock it with money or not sba is being kind of funky and feels over million or because if youre if you never drew on the first one for the second one you go up to million in this if you want but youre being kind of strange on the larger deals where theyre pulling them in advance if its the second round murph do you want to talk about that a little richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah you hit it right on the head were just getting some interesting feedback from the sba as it relates to some of these larger borrowers i think theres going to be a heightened audit attention placed on these and with the transition going on in washington right now its a little bit up in the air but generally speaking i mean i think as it relates to volumes i mean ed is right i mean weve seen a tremendous amount of growth early on in this latest round by those highly affected customers and its obviously good from outstandings and some of the fee recognition but kind of most importantly its just were seeing these customers who have really been pounded over the course of the last months getting some help here its just its really great to see this from just watching them and then watching our own portfolio nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 got it thats helpful and kind of changing gears along those lines if youd back out ppp it looks like loans are up yearoveryear in with onboarding more production on the residential side in what are your kind of growth expectations in keeping in mind the hires and so forth that edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp rich rich or richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp tim do you want to take that richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp well yeah i would just say just in general our guidance has kind of been that mid to highsingledigit growth over a number of years here and going into this year i think we were thinking that it was going to be a maybe one of the more challenging years to get that fortunately its just we have so many different loan engines that we utilize and if you take a look at this year we saw every one of them really have a pretty solid year so the premium finance group got just a spectacular year cre had a good first half of the year ci had a great second half of the year so its really one of the benefits of having this more granular approach to portfolio growth so i look at this year coming up and based on the pipelines and based on the feedback that were getting from the business leaders we should be pretty much right back at that mid to highsingledigit growth rate so obviously a lot depends on how the economy continues to rebound but overall feeling pretty good nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay got it and if i could ask one more indiscernible nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co sorry edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp tim do you have anything you want to say about that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 no i think rich covered it but we do believe the ppp process will continue to yield good prospects for us and that will help us get to those numbers so nothing to add otherwise nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay great if i could just edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp tim it also seems that there as these shots start to im getting my shot on monday by the way im an old guy getting my shot so as that starts happening theres so much pentup demand i think its going to explode if you ever try to buy a refrigerator or any sort of hard asset right now it takes forever to get it because inventories are so low youre going to see the inventory build coming up theyll require ph we wouldnt even consider whats going on there theyll require probably more line usage our line usage stay at and but i think you may see a little bit more coming with the but i think were going to roll out of this thing come june and july when we get the herd immunity if everything works right so who knows i think notwithstanding that were going to be on highsingle digits this year based on all the information we have right now but its just going to enhance it i think nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and if i could just ask one more on expenses just trying to put together all those items that were discussed earlier the mba is forecasting volumes to be down this year and with advertising spend perhaps not likely to get back to full run rate levels and then youve got the branch consolidations and closures and the contingent consideration perhaps going away entirely i mean is it fair to expect expenses versus to be up lowsingle digit or flattish any thoughts just overall along those lines timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well still a lot of it really depends on where that mortgage number comes out at but if you followed the mba forecast then all else sort of being equal its probably midsingle digit expense growth is sort of where i would expect this to come out because we do some salary increases and we are growing and we are investing in digital improvements et cetera so midsingle digits is about right nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats very helpful edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i one thing to keep in mind is we did double up on the with the mortgage sales by keeping of the books this quarter and taking out of the next quarter with all the expenses and all the revenue of that so a little bit wild there too but i dont think expenses are as bad as everybody thinks they are take the onetimers plus that little move we made its a timing issues with a lot of it but we shall see wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah sounds good thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael young from truist securities your line is now open michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thats the first truist securities ive heard from anybody michael young q analyst truist securities inc well glad to make the introduction edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp whats up mike is everything good michael young q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah doing well just wanted to ask maybe kind of a higher level question youve in the past kind of referred people to the net overhead ratio to kind of balance growth and investment with earnings and profitability is that still kind of how youre thinking in managing the business obviously coming out of kind of this fog of war if you will where do you think we can get to on that ratio if thats still the right ratio to look at edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp oh yes i think it is were fortunate to have the why we have the mortgage business well we invest in this for times is exactly like this when rates go down it can pick it up for us that certainly helps that overhead ratio we look at almost equaled what the runoff of the margin was but therell be a period of time in there where were going to get kind of an influx here of therell be influx where the its got to go up and the margin will be moved we hope to have the margin moving as fast we shall see but we always say less than was good weve lowered that down to but with our size down about to would be a good number for us in the budget its what tim do you remember timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah we typically dont give out budget numbers but i think in a sort of a more normal mortgage market i think in the is probably where we would think we could be given the current environment were better than that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 right now because mortgage is so strong but if mortgages fall off then i think you probably we our target was before weve grown so much we think thats probably in the now edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah we would hope that if we go up basis points the margin goes up basis points too thats kind of the how we work it you can follow the math there pretty easy michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and maybe just as a followup youve kind of mentioned efforts to cut some branches you still have kind of the multiple bank subsidiaries would there be any opportunities to consolidate maybe one or two of those i know youve used it as part of the wealth strategy in the past and you havent thought that made sense but in this environment have things changed at all there edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp everything is open but right now were very happy with where we are that overhead ratio if lets put it this way its not just a cost issue because the costs are minimal as you think about everything behind the scenes its already consolidated and runs that way its strictly a morale and a marketing issue for us plus the ability to get lowcost deposits with our ability to offer times fdic coverage would we consider merging some together yes that would come i think with geographic expansion if were going to move out of the chicago area which we probably have to happen in the next two or three or four years we probably would start collapsing charters here and i like the number its nice to have people who know the markets running their shops and feeling good about it so yeah we could do it but i think it would be a function of expansion out of our current market area would we want to keep a charter in a different area yeah we would its just it would be a function of growth where you can get down to it but nothing on the horizon now i mean were growing awfully fast were doing pretty well the credit is good why would you just try to screw it up michael young q analyst truist securities inc it makes sense all right thanks operator thank you at this time im showing no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to mr edward wehmer for closing remarks edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well thank you we appreciate you all listening in today get your shots if you can ill let you know how it goes for me they never bothered me that much but this is going to be an interesting time and interesting year i think you could see that we kind of have our hands around what we want to do and lets see if we can get there but if you look at our history weve got pt pp growth and with our growth in loan our historical 10year growth in loans if you take it back years and see the numbers are even better wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 but over the last years weve got terrific growth in net earnings and that book value and assets and deposits id put our results up there to
