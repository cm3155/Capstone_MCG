president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks to everyone for joining us today as we recap our fourth quarter and full year performance as i look back on the last months im proud of our teams ability to produce solid results which include strong loan and deposit growth and continued fee income momentum we earned million or per share in the fourth quarter and million or per share for the full year of on total revenue of billion average loan balances grew on a linkedquarter annualized basis for comparison purposes publicly traded banks that have reported todate have shown a median linkedquarter annualized increase of in average loan balances for the total portfolio fourth quarter top line loan production was a record billion total payoffs and paydowns were slightly more elevated than usual at million this quarter or of loans net average loan growth of million for the quarter was led by ci and cre and the recent growth in residential real estate loans originated both in private banking and consumer continued in the fourth quarter in we added million of mortgage balances on a yearoveryear basis for an increase of compared to an increase of in we continue to see growth through both market share gains and in our underpenetrated markets as line utilization trends have remained fairly steady the top three loan growth regions for the fourth quarter were st louis colorado and texas these are the areas with less than market share for us fullyear production of billion represented a increase over levels and led to billion of net growth on average we experienced both growth and ph pass as a result of robust ma activity amongst our clients and in several markets have been able to take advantage of disruption caused by bank mergers we continue to see opportunity in our markets and the production pipeline remained strong as we look forward into the first quarter net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter were of average loans and on a fullyear basis net chargeoffs were of average loans in line with our historic averages and consistent with our comments last quarter non performing loan balances did indeed decline by from the third quarter our loan book remains well diversified and im proud of our longterm track record of quality underwriting these results and the quality of our portfolio drove the lower provision in the fourth quarter now looking to the income statement net interest income increased compared to the third quarter driven by strong asset growth and lower funding costs as we mentioned last quarter our strong loan pipeline should help us continue to grow net interest income even in the current rate environment on the fee income side we saw continued momentum with an increase of compared to the third quarter corporate trust and fund services both posted strong results and our investment banking teams saw increased underwriting activity and customer demand which along with positive fixed income markets drove solid increases in agency municipal and mbs trading revenue again this quarter there were some noise in our other income line related to market adjustments that often have expense offsets including positive impacts from coli and equity earnings income our expenses for the quarter increased million compared to the third quarter driven largely by incentives tied to business and revenue umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 growth hiring in several growth businesses and overall company performance the momentum in our fee income related businesses and the correlation with commission payments can add variability to our expense levels we estimate that approximately threefourths of the quarteroverquarter increase in expense was tied to business growth we continue to invest in our business including the reinvigoration of our retail business weve discussed before rolling out the new teller platform online banking upgrades and online account opening capabilities which are nearing completion in the fourth quarter we launched a retail credit card campaign which drove some of the increases in advertising and postage expense this campaign will build on the growth weve seen over the past year with retail card account originations up compared to levels additionally weve been opportunistically adding to our teams and to our revenueproducing capabilities for example weve hired an experienced team of middle market commercial bankers in the desirable twin cities area and a successful group of business banking professionals in salt lake city several of these new hires are on board now and the rest are in process well share more details on these teams in the coming quarters in closing our success in has set the bar high for us in with the current rate backdrop yearoveryear revenue growth is likely to moderate from the levels we experienced in however we arent slowing our focus and we remain very diligent about controlling expenses as tightly as we can without mortgaging our future as i shared earlier we will continue to invest prudently in our business to enhance our revenuegenerating capabilities and improve customer acquisition trends and experience but will also have an eye on efficiency while we typically do not give guidance i believe we can do better than the current consensus earnings estimate barring any material unexpected deterioration in the operating environment now ill turn the call over to ram for a more detailed discussion of our results ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner the benefits from our strong loan and securities growth balance and lower funding costs that drove the increase in net interest income were partially offset by declining asset yields and the payoff of some higheryielding balances that shifted the mix of our loan portfolio total earning asset yields fell basis points to from the linkedquarter driven largely by a 30basis point decline in loan yields approximately of our loans are variable tied to shortterm interest rates one month libor fell basis points in the fourth quarter impacting of our loans that repriced during that period interestbearing deposit costs declined basis points contributing to the 24basis point reduction in the cost of interestbearing liabilities and the 18basis point decline in total cost of funds net interest margin for the quarter was down basis points from the prior quarter while our net interest spread at was virtually unchanged from the prior quarter the benefit from free funds declined by basis points sequentially as their value declined in a lower interest rate environment overall margin was positively impacted by approximately basis points from lower funding costs and balance sheet mix changes and basis points from higher loan fees negative offsets included approximately basis umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 points related to loan pricing basis points from the decreased benefit of free funds and basis points from excess liquidity primarily driven by excess deposit flows in our institutional businesses repricing in the afs book provided about basis point of net interest margin improvement as cash flow rolling off at during the quarter was reinvested at considering recent market dynamics and our expectation that the fed will hold rates for now we would expect approximately basis points to basis points of net interest margin compression for the first quarter as always the actual outcome for net interest margin will depend on a variety of factors such as the pace at which libor moves loan growth the potential variability in our aviation trust and public fund businesses and our overall balance sheet mix and needs for funding average total deposits increased on a linkedquarter basis largely in institutional and commercial money market balances along with the beginning of annual buildup of public funds dda balances rose by to billion driven largely by corporate trust including our aviation business and the typical yearend buildup of cash for municipal payments our overall deposit composition by source is shown on slide moving back to the income statement mariner discussed some of the opportunities were seeing in fee income and the detail on specific drivers are shown on slides and total reported noninterest income was million for the quarter an increase of million compared to the third quarter positives include trust and securities processing income which improved million or over the third quarter driven largely by funds services and corporate trust revenue additionally trading and investment banking income increased by million due to higher trading volumes also included in the increase were some market and volumerelated items reported on the other line million of coli income or a million increase from the third quarter which has the proportional offset in deferred compensation expense a million increase in equity earnings on alternative investments which is one contributor to the bonus and commission expense and a million linkedquarter increase in derivative income million of lower gains on sale of securities partially offset these increases noninterest expense for the fourth quarter was million an increase of million from the third quarter more than of the quarteroverquarter increase in expenses were driven by higher bonus and commissions expense within the salaries line item tied to business and revenue growth and overall company performance deferred compensation expense the offset for the increased coli income increased million on a linked quarter basis more detail on quarterly expenses can be found on slide our effective tax rate was for the fourth quarter and for the full year benefiting from greater levels of income from taxexempt sources such as municipal bonds for we expect our tax rate to be between and finally going back to slide in the asset quality section we provided some highlevel preliminary detail about the implementation of cecl we expect the day one impact on our reserves will be an increase of approximately with very minimal impact on our common equity tier ratio at adoption these estimates were calculated using current economic outlook on the current characteristics of our portfolio we plan to review make any necessary modeling updates and present our final day impact when we file our umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 10k day provisioning will depend on the mix of portfolio growth as well as expectations for the macroeconomic variables highlighted on this slide that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc mariner or ram just wanted to start on the in the investments youre making how should we be thinking about the level of expense growth in versus in light of this and in light of kind of the more challenging revenue outlook that weve been presented by lower rates mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well we dont obviously give guidance on that but what i would say is that the and we talk about some of the level of business investment expense related to revenue and investing in teams and things like that and some of the marketing dollars that hit the fourth quarter quarters making them look little higher than they had been some of the answers to that will be dependent on what the revenue picture looks like in and we certainly expect we talked about it in our comments as we always do that the loan growth and pipeline numbers looks pretty good as we look in to the first quarter and we are as we mentioned in the comments investing in a couple teams in salt lake and in minneapolis so those things will kind of weigh right on the expenses i dont know ram you want to add anything you dont give any guidance on that you shouldnt expect a big reduction in our expense indiscernible so i dont know what else to say ram do you have anything umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp chris well definitely be cautious on expenses obviously internally we focus a lot on operating leverage so to your point the operating and mariners comments the revenue environment the rate environment will be a tough one going into and as mariner said we set the bar pretty high for us in but that doesnt mean we will not focus on the expense side of the equation mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp weve definitely focused on making sure that we operate as efficiently as we can in without mortgaging the bright future that we see by continuing to invest in our company ive never been as pumped as i am about investments weve made and the team that we have as i look into the next three and five years i mean is going to be tough operating environment but the investments we made and the team ive got on the field if we could go to the super bowl like our chiefs are going to the super bowl i would say we have a super bowl contention team christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats good color and thanks for that im just trying to get a sense of where you are in the investments right the two teams how much of the impact was felt in versus a continuation of what you see as some revenue opportunities to invest mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah im sorry chris i dont know if we can give you too much more color on that without becoming a company that gives guidance christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats fine mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc in terms of the quarter there was a comment in the release about a derivatives offset could you just im just trying to make sure thats kind of it seems like a onetime item but just could you give some color on that ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah sure chris this is ram so just to give you some context for the full year our total derivative expenses were less than so what you saw in this particular quarter was an adjustment or a benefit of million that reduced our expenses it basically what it did was reversed out all the higher derivative umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 expenses in the second and third quarters weve been talking about so if you go to our press releases in second and third our derivative expense spiked because of some activity so our notional book on the backtoback swaps has increased about in so as part of that we revisited our valuation adjustments or valuation assumptions and made it more in line with where the industry is so thats why you see that quarteroverquarter spike of million swing but i would look at the total expense line item on a full year basis christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great thanks and then last one on the seasonality in the deposits how do we think about i mean it seems like this quarters seasonality was even more meaningful than prior fourth quarters how do we think about kind of first quarter first second quarter of just the balance sheet as it accordions up and down thanks ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp as i said in the prepared remarks some of the seasonality is typical with public funds those come in the second half of december really so there wasnt a big impact in the fourth quarter because of public funds necessarily a lot of the deposit inflows and the excess liquidity had to do with our institutional businesses particularly asset servicing because funds werent readily deploying some of the cash balances into the market and then the aviation trust business which is fairly new to us and so theres a little bit of volatility to it public funds typically peaks in the first quarter and then starts to head down so its really hard to say whats going to happen to some of these deposit balances given their very nature they tend to be very transient in nature short term they get deployed pretty easily in the markets so a lot of things can change on us which is why its really hard to give a clear answer on what will happen to deposits and margins for that matter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i would add though the aviation trust business it is new to us so we dont have a lot of experience with it but as the business continues to expand one second here indiscernible somethings going by on the road here snow blower snow truck just went by anyway our expectations for the aviation trust business are that as it expands and we have more business coming along that the growth in that deposit base stays behind should grow because a number of clients is growing so there is an expectation that that deposit base continues to grow even though we dont have a lot of history with it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks chris operator the next question is from nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co thank you good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey nate ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co going back to the last question on deposit growth expectations just perhaps more broadly just thinking about in aggregate deposits exceeded loan growth in so just curious just given kind of where youre pricing and given some of the expansion in the corporate trust side of things if you still expect deposit growth to exceed loan growth in james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp no this is jim nate we dont anticipate that however on the increased expenses that you saw in fourth quarter the increased marketing expense for the consumer division was to continue to attract consumer deposits the increase in the consumer card spend that were currently doing that weve seen success is to continue to build our consumer franchise so we are looking to balance some of that growth in our consumer division we have been able to successfully attract obviously commercial deposits via yield but with the new markets that were going into those teams are laserfocused on deposit collection as well not just loan building balances so we do anticipate those to be successful ph obtaining balances in salt lake as well as minneapolis but to exceed our loan balance expectations i dont anticipate that nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful color appreciate it jim and then just changing gears and thinking about the institutional segment the pretax margin ticked up nicely in the quarter and i think its the highest level that weve seen last seven or eight quarters or so so just curious just given some of the investments that youve made in a number of those units and just given the scale that you guys are seeing there if we can kind of see this as a sustainable pre tax margin level going forward or if you think theres more investments there maybe going to limit that expansion ph or this level going forward james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp i would think we could anticipate this level going forward we continue to make investments as you know we closed on the last corporate trust acquisition while smaller in revenue we have made considerable investments weve discussed what were doing with the various fintech partnerships that we established as far as the fdi sweep sic fdic sweep relationships but the corporate trust business as well as the traditional brokerdealer umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 business but weve seen increases in the bond trading monthaftermonth quarterafterquarter which has been reflected in the yearend results and were very excited with what were seeing with institutional i think im confident youll see continued results from that division mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah its very leverageable at this point the investments that have been made nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator the next question is from gordon mcguire with stephens please go ahead gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning gordon mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc i wanted to followup on the discussion around the bonus and commissions do you have what that how much of the call it million increase in compensation this year was related to that and tied to the revenue side in volumes mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so we didnt break it out exactly for you well probably going to stick with the answer we gave in our prepared remarks which is that threefourths of the expense increase came from business generation activities of which included in bonus and well yeah so you have the bonus and commissions tied to new business we had some marketing dollars related to the increased activities for our credit card and deposit gathering activities theres some expenses related to the hiring the regional hirings of the folks that weve added in minneapolis and salt lake and ram you might have a couple of ph additional thoughts umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah gordon if you go to page of our slide deck we kind of enumerate where the drivers of the salaries and benefits are so id go back to what mariner said about of the quarteroverquarter increase was because of volume and revenue growth and then my comments also of the expense growth is related to bonus and commissions again so of the million increase in salary and benies million was tied to bonus and commissions again overall company performance widget growth revenue growth all of that gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc yeah i guess i was just trying to get at given the really strong balance sheet growth the strong fee growth and how you gauge whether youre kind of at a high level watermark for bonus and commissions specifically for this year mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean it was a hell of a good quarter i guess love to repeat it i mean again we dont give guidance on that but it was a pretty damn good quarter gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc got it and then just switching to fees specifically cards purchased volumes were up double digits this year but interchange fees kind of lowsingledigit growth can you talk about the headwinds youre seeing on interchange rates and whether you see that continuing mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah well ill just high level and then jim who reports them can go deeper but as we talked in the past someodd percent of our interchange income comes from the healthcare business and weve talked about that business in the sense that we dont necessarily control what we get paid there because we are partners and we have sharing arrangements so that pulls down what would be the numbers otherwise so we carry better interchange in the commercial and in the consumer but the volume you see in our slide deck on page ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp you can kind of see the breakdown of the percentages and thats really what pulls it down i dont know if you want to add anything to it but its the sharing relationships with our healthcare business pulls it down now the beauty if its working right is it should be volumedriven right so all those partners and all those relationships so from just an earnings growth perspective its a lower margin but decent growth so billion in the quarter of interchange spend right so we expect that number to continue to grow on a quarterly basis umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp in that model its obviously tied together with the deposit growth coupled with the account fees so the cards is a piece of it but certainly the lower margin which mariner just described gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc got it thats helpful and then mariner just any updates on ma prospects where the focus would be and just readiness for any kind of ma given the internal investments this year mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure so i mean as far as readiness goes all of the things we talked about the investments weve made et cetera were ready were very much would like to no new comments really from quartertoquarter as far as where we are with it weve got an active effort active team active calling effort very much would like to do a deal that we can see all the right things from whether its synergies or cultural overlap to ultimately spread our expenses over a larger organization within our footprint or contiguous so were ready to go and would have an active effort and continue to look for the right deal on the banking side and then again no new real comments we continue to look for corporate trust opportunities aviation trust stuff anything related to our corporate trust and trust activities and we had our investment services business where were providing banking services to broker dealers and fintech companies and were looking across that whole spectrum for either product additions where we can add more products ph on the truck to the customer or boltontype acquisitions or consolidation opportunities we believe that on the corporate trust side we can continue to be consolidator there as weve been successful with that and are already having a lot of success we continue to see opportunities there and wed like to continue to see opportunities there gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc all right thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks gordon operator the next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities good morning guys ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning ebrahim umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities so most of my questions have been asked and answered a couple of just followups and sorry if i missed this the billion in periodend deposit growth now i understand theres some seasonal outflows we should expect in the first quarter but any sense of how much of that you expect to retain beyond of the billion or billion ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp its really tough to say ebrahim this is ram its really tough to say with some of these businesses theres the traditional seasonality that weve talked about historically about public funds but as i said earlier and mariner added to it some of these businesses were fairly new especially the corporate trust the aviation business and thats growing really nicely on a steady basis and then theres volatility especially at the end of the quarter sometimes so its really hard to say a long answer indiscernible its really hard to say what the outflow is going to look like mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and weve talked about the success really across the board on fee income which is coupled in a lot of ways with deposit growth so fund services is having success and with every account we bring on our fund services theres a bit of institutional deposit business that comes with each and every one of those relationships so hard to tell at this point certainly therell be some ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp contraction mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp some contraction just because of the public funds business ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp i talked about a 3basis point impact to margin from excess liquidity and if you look at on a quarteroverquarter basis were probably about million to million richer in liquidity so thats probably a guide for you to consider in answering your question too ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities and what was the public fund at the end of the year in balances umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i dont have that handy ebrahim the second half of december is that when it starts peaking up so first quarter is the seasonal peak for it i can get that to you later ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities all right ill circle back and just i guess separately i think youve been so you had a very strong quarter on loan growth youve been steadfast i think ph too back half of last year even when things were macrowise not looking great in terms of highsingledigit loan growth expectations just talk to us in terms of anything in the markets that seems concerning and what are the markets where youre seeing the best growth and industry verticals where youre seeing the best opportunities mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp its really coming from everywhere my remarks have been the same for quite some time about why we continue to see sort of better than industry loan growth which is a lot of it is ill hit them high level again but underpenetration in a lot of our large markets so just being able to execute the right people on the ground plenty opportunity for us to just get a decent market share and several large markets and we continue to be underpenetrated vertically also right as it relates to stronger efforts over time to put specific specialty individuals and marketing and all that and hiring against particular verticals and market into them specifically more than we were we used to be generalists so those two things which weve talked about for some time continue to drive a lot of opportunity for us and we think theres a long runway for that we were also just have a really good team theres a lot of tenure putting people and particularly in the commercial lending side as i think a lot of you know when youre able to put the same people in front of your prospects and clients for a long period of time it bodes well for you and its a long sales cycle in this business so were uninterrupted from the crisis so we dont have to retrain our prospects and customers and again thats kind of the same remarks ive had about that for quite some time i dont know jim if you want to add james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp no we saw loan growth in every market but one and it was more of a rural market for us industrywise there hasnt been i mean there are pockets but we are seeing some slowdown in transportation i believe i mentioned that last quarter as well nothing in our portfolio that were concerned with but just macro indicators that raise concerns but our production last quarter almost was from ci so with that ci business we get the treasury business and the ancillary accounts and so its been exactly what we with the addition of the real estate which is over the last five to six years on the cre book but its what we have always done and our market penetration as mariner addressed earlier the markets that have historically been underpenetrated but we have a compelling story and were continuing to tell it in the markets that weve expanded into over the years weve had great growth in texas and colorado st louis and it continues to move forward onto salt lake and minneapolis umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities understood thanks for taking my questions operator the next question is from david long with raymond james please go ahead david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning david mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc ram i think you indicated for the first quarter what you were looking at said that the nim may be down to basis points and just curious if you could provide a little color on how you see asset yields and the funding side of the balance sheet both working in the first quarter to get to that point ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so if you just look at onemonth libor right since yearend its come down about basis points its right now at basis points so as i said in my prepared comments about of our book is tied to onemonth libor so assuming that the fed doesnt do a whole lot just because of the movement in libor you should see some pressure on the asset yields or i should say loan yields but that should be offset by the growth prospects that both jim and mariner talked about and then on the portfolio side if you look at our disclosures we have about billion of rolloffs or cash flows coming due in the next months and approximately a quarter of them were in the first quarter and the roll onrolloff difference is about positive basis points so that should offset some of that asset yield pressure just from whats happening with the libor rate and then on the funding side were being very diligent on the funding side obviously well be very cautious and react to the environment and so we should see some alleviation of pressure on deposit cost and overall if the interest rate stays the way it is same thing on net interest margin as well david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay got it thank you and then as it relates to the commerce trust acquisition i believe that closed at the end of november did that contribute to any of the deposit growth that you had in the quarter umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp not materially no david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then lastly mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thats a small acquisition david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc right okay mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc and lastly as it relates to cecl as you guys are getting closer to actually having to report results under cecl have you thought or does it change your appetite for any particular type of loan does it change how you either your willingness to make that loan or the pricing that you have historically done versus what you may do in the future mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp not really because i think whatever we would do is going to come on the margin then its going to come in over time as youve probably learned theres different asset classes that carry different weighting and the mortgage business for example is one of those and currently for us thats not a big part of our balance sheet so it doesnt have a big impact we do plan on and weve talked about that expanding our mortgage business but it should happen over time and have an impact that you would imagine would come with something that happens measured and over time so not really no nothing we expect to change the way we do business actually the way we bring in business today and the type of the business we bring in today is actually more beneficial to us than a lot of our peers as it relates to cecl ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 dave it all comes down to competition right so what the big banks do if they react to cecl which is unlikely then well have to change our terms to it but otherwise its strictly on a street fight mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate it operator operator instructions the next question is a followup from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks ph for your thoughts just two quick ones first any thoughts or any updated thoughts on the buyback you obviously havent been using it because of the organic growth but any kind of change in philosophy on levels of where you might consider buying the stock mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no and for those who havent heard it before i mean we obviously want to put our capital to work to build the business first so were going to prioritize our capital against acquisition liftouts and things like that and then to the extent that those arent coming as quickly as we like we can obviously always do buybacks andor increase our dividend and do some more acquisitions so it can be a mix of all of it we keep an eye on it youve seen us do it before so we have a willingness did our first asr not long ago so certainly willing to do it when the time is right and its appropriately priced and we feel good about it but other than that were going to be focused on putting our capital to work building the business christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and mariner on the ma front i think your last deal with marquette it was billion in assets can you remind us the range of what you might be considering obviously and seems to be the market moving towards more transactional and transformational deals but maybe your appetite for size mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp there is no hard and fast rule there the smaller the deal youre doing all the same amount of work to do that and you dont get the list out of it certainly the marquette deal would be a nice bottom end of the range and the bigger so and then the only other thing that i would say because we have we take risk very seriously the bigger the opportunity the less risk were going
