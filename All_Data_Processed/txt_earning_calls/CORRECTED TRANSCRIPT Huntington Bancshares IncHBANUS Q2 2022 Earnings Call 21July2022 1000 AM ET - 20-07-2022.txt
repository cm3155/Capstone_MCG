expectations we are driving organic growth opportunities by providing enhanced product offerings to the tcf customer base and growing share of wallet we completed the acquisition of capstone last month which adds a toptier middle market investment bank and advisory firm bolstering our capital markets capabilities were pleased with the early contribution from our new colleagues who added million of capital market fees in the last two weeks of the quarter postclosing looking forward we see significant revenue synergies within our customer base as well turning to slide we extended our track record of modeled credit outperformance in the recent ccar stress test results this years process included the acquired tcf loan portfolios and the results did not materially change our modeled performance relative to peers this highlighted the robust credit strength of huntingtons balance sheet which has continued to outperform peer median benchmarks in every ccar cycle since finally i want to highlight the accomplishments of the tcf combination its been just over a year since we closed on the acquisition and since then weve delivered on the commitments we shared at announcement we closed quickly in under six months and converted systems just four months later we delivered the cost synergies earlier than guided the pace of digital investment spend has doubled from the prior run rate accelerating our digital initiatives weve delivered leading financial performance which is evident in our results this quarter finally we are capturing incremental opportunities from the addition of key markets and capabilities through our revenue synergy initiatives over the past year weve added over revenue producing colleagues in minnesota and colorado to support wealth management business

productivity from the acquired branches and a positive reception to the huntington product offerings and customer service experience our business banking expansion at twin cities and denver is also showing substantial momentum where we are pleased to have already achieved the top five ranking for sba lending in both markets weve seen early traction huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 from our wealth management launch in the twin cities with aum building yeartodate as a result of this success weve replicated that approach in denver and weve hired an experienced leader and other new colleagues to build out our capabilities as for our inventory and equipment finance businesses the teams continue to capitalize on the opportunities to harness the combined scale to better serve our clients today were the seventh largest bankowned national platform and i expect that ranking to increase based on the momentum we are experiencing these initiatives are ongoing and we expect them to contribute to our growth over multiple years we are wellpositioned to grow shareholder value zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our second quarter results we reported earnings per common share of adjusted for notable items earnings per common share were return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was we were pleased to see sustained momentum in our loan balances with total loans increasing by billion and excluding ppp loans increased by billion total average deposits also increased with growth in both consumer and commercial balances preprovision net revenue expanded sequentially and grew from last quarter consistent with our plan we reduced core expenses below our target of billion driven by the realization of cost synergies credit quality was exceptional with record low net chargeoffs of basis points and nonperforming assets reduced to basis points slide shows our continued trajectory of ppnr expansion we see coming together quite well as we drive sustainable profitability and highlight the earnings power of the company supported by our organic growth initiatives and harnessing the benefits from the tcf acquisition we remain committed to our long track record of managing to positive operating leverage with disciplined expense management even as we continue to invest in the business turning to slide average loan balances increased quarteroverquarter totaling billion excluding ppp total loan balance has increased billion or driven by commercial and consumer loans within commercial excluding ppp average loans increased by billion or from the prior quarter these results were supported by broadbased demand across commercial lending that is driving robust new production line utilization remained relatively stable during the quarter on a core ci basis while we saw higher balances within our inventory finance business commercial growth was led by middle market corporate and specialty banking which collectively increased by million during the quarter asset finance contributed meaningfully with balances higher by million inventory finance continues to rebuild toward a more normalized level with average balances up million during the quarter commercial real estate balances also increased by million auto dealer floor plan balances were relatively stable increasing by million as supply chain constraints continued to dampen inventory levels in consumer growth was led by residential mortgage which increased by billion driven by slower prepays and higher mix of onbalance sheet loan production we also saw steady growth in rvmarine and indirect auto average home equity balances declined by million however we were pleased to see endofperiod balance growth driven by robust new production of firstlien refinanced products huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 turning to slide we delivered average deposit growth of billion deposit growth was led by commercial with deposits up billion while consumer balances increased by million from the prior quarter this growth reflects our initiatives to drive primary bank relationships and new customer acquisition across the bank we remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at just basis points for the second quarter on slide we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and nim core net interest income excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion increased by million or to billion consistent with our prior guidance net interest margin increased driven by higher earning asset yields as a result of our asset sensitivity position and lower fed cash balances slide highlights huntingtons deposit pricing discipline we have a long history of managing through cycles and we believe our deposit base today is even stronger than it was starting the last tightening cycle for the second quarter weve seen little change to our average cost of deposits given the timing of rapid fed rate moves occurring later in the quarter that said we are remaining dynamic in this environment we are managing the portfolio at a very granular and segmented level client by client in many cases to ensure pricing discipline and growing the primary bank relationships to bring lower cost operational deposits turning to slide we are managing the balance sheet in order to position ourselves to benefit from higher expected rates in the short term while also being judicious on managing possible downside rate risks over the longer term we continued to execute on our hedging strategy during the second quarter and increased our downside protection by executing a net billion of receivefixed swaps our expectation is to continue to add to this hedging program during the third quarter additionally we are managing the securities portfolio to both capture the benefit from higher rates over time as well as protect capital we increased the proportion of securities and held to maturity during the quarter and are reinvesting securities portfolio cash flows at rates well above portfolio yields moving to slide noninterest income was million up million yearoveryear and down million from last quarter we saw record activity within our capital markets business during the quarter which drove revenues up million from prior quarter additionally we saw expansion in our cards and payments revenues and deposit service charges fee revenues were impacted this quarter by lower gain on sale from sba loan sales as we sold less balances in the second quarter compared to the prior quarter recall we restarted our normal sba loan sales earlier this year and while loan production remains robust this quarters gain on sale is generally aligned to our goforward expectations fees were also impacted by a decline in mortgage banking as volumes continued to normalize from the exceptionally strong levels seen last year and due to lower saleable spreads while we are pleased with the sales and client engagement traction in our wealth management business we saw lower overall revenues as market based aum changes outweighed continued momentum in net asset flows moving on to slide noninterest expense declined million from the prior quarter excluding notable items core expenses declined by million to million as we completed the cost savings from the acquisition and achieved our targeted expense level our efficiency ratio which is an outcome of our revenue drivers and huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 expense management activities came in at on a reported basis and adjusted for notable items was for the quarter in line with our mediumterm target slide recaps our capital position common equity tier ended the quarter at and within our target operating range of to as we go forward our capital priorities remain unchanged with our first priority to fund organic loan growth our expectation is that given the strong sustained levels of loan growth buybacks will be de minimis if any for the remainder of the year with the robust return on equity we are generating we expect to be able to fund this organic growth and see capital ratios move higher over the balance of our tangible common equity ratio or tce declined to as a result of aoci marks on the securities portfolio recall this is an accounting construct that temporarily reduces equity as value marks are taken and then reverses over time and this does not impact our regulatory capital ratios our tce ratio excluding the aoci impact has been relatively stable near level finally our dividend yield remains number one in our peer group at on slide credit quality continues to perform very well as mentioned net chargeoffs were a record low of basis points benefiting from another quarter of net recoveries in commercial portfolios and continued stability in consumer credit quality nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced each of the last four quarters we also saw lower criticized loans which have improved both from the prior quarter and prior year allowance for credit losses was flat at of total loans reflecting a conservative reserve posture given the heighted economic uncertainty even as our internal portfolio metrics show stability we are proud to report on slide that we have achieved our mediumterm goals since sharing these targets we have been intently focused on executing on our commitments and managing dynamically through the changing environment we have been guiding that we indiscernible reflect these goals for the second half of we have now achieved these results one quarter ahead of schedule this performance represents the earnings power of the franchise the tcf acquisition bolstered many of these areas and allowed us to gain incremental scale and profitability as steve mentioned earlier and the incremental growth momentum is only just the beginning as we stand today we believe our return on capital is compelling compared to our peer set and demonstrates the financial rigor with which we operate that is focused on creating fundamental value for shareholders finally turning to slide let me update our outlook our guidance assumes the consensus economic outlook through and it incorporates the rate curve as of end of june our loan growth outlook remains unchanged indiscernible as a result of our balance sheet growth and the rate curve outlook we are again revising guidance higher for net interest income we now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis excluding ppp and purchase accounting accretion to grow in the highteens to low percent range in fee income we continue to expect growth between low and midsingle digits for the fourth quarter on a yearover year basis we are continuing to see encouraging trends in our payments capital markets and wealth and advisory businesses as we shared previously our guidance incorporates the normalization of mortgage banking revenues and the fair play enhancements we are making over the course of the second half of the year note our guidance fully captures the expected benefits of our capstone partners and torana acquisitions which closed in the second quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 on expenses we are pleased to have completed the cost savings program we are balancing continued momentum in the business and strong revenue growth with the uncertainty around the nearterm macro outlook and inflationary pressures that are affecting the economy the strong revenue performance of the business will drive a degree of associated compensation expenses in addition to targeted investments to support key growth initiatives hence our expectation is for core expenses excluding capstone partners and torana to grow at a modest level for the balance of additionally capstone and torana will add incremental expenses of approximately million beginning in the third quarter run rate finally given our continued exceptional credit performance were revising our fullyear net chargeoffs down to less than basis points from approximately basis points previously that concludes our opening remarks tim lets open up the call for qa please timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi want to see if you could maybe comment on your deposit growth expectation how youre thinking about the ability to grow deposits here and possibly the makeup of that growth i know you didnt include that in your formal guidance and maybe if you could just kind of help us think about how we should model the growth thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc absolutely thanks john this is zach ill take that one i think just maybe taking a step back were pleased to see the deposits continue to expand in the second quarter as we talked about in the prepared remarks and we guided that we had that expectation and we were pleased to see it come through and be delivered the outlook going forward continues to be for modest growth commercial growing faster consumer likely flat to down a bit because the environment is clearly volatile with the rate moves weve seen as of late but thats the traction were seeing and so far its corroborated here just in the first few weeks of july the focus weve got is really huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 deepening engagement with our clients growing our core operating accounts certainly within the commercial business primary bank relationships broadly across the franchise and really balancing that growth with pricing over time clearly but thats the growth youve got for now john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks and then related to that maybe can you just collaborate a bit on the deposit beta expectations in terms of how they could trend in the back half indiscernible your terminal beta ultimately thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes ill take that one again as well so yes thus far in the cycle its been pretty limited in terms of pricing changes that weve seen come through as we highlighted in the prepared remarks average deposit costs for q2 just basis points higher than q1 so very lowest that represents less than beta with that being said clearly the rate moves happened late in the quarter in may and then more in june and given the forecast for july we do expect q3 and q4 to be higher as we take a step back and just think about this cycle its clearly changing and there are factors that are driving beta to be higher than really the last rate hike in the cycle we started from a lower starting point asset growth continues to be pretty strong here across the industry and these multiple more than basis point rate moves that are happening in quick succession are clearly factors for beta with that being said we do continue to recognize the level of excess liquidity across the entire industry at this point is quite high and inflation itself tends to increase balances over time as that filters into wages and corporate revenues taking a step back its still very early in the cycle our posture is to be very very disciplined and manage this with a lot of rigor at a very detailed level as we noted before and with that primary bank focus and i think everything were seeing thus far and the incremental forecasting that we do on a monthly basis continues to corroborate that were on the trend that we were expecting john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks for taking the questions operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning how are you doing zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc wanted to just get a sense on how youre thinking about the buyback resumption what the parameters would be and what youre looking at to turn that back on zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah well thanks for the question this is zach i can take that as well as weve talked about in the prepared remarks for q2 we didnt do any buybacks given the capstone acquisition closing and i think as we think about the next several set of quarters our capital priorities are really guided by our overall priority set is first and foremost to fund organic growth and given the strong roe that we get on the organic loans we bring in thats our top priority thats what we intended and are really pleased to be able to allocate the capital even as we also manage capital ratios upward here trending towards the yearend its a little too early to call what happens in and as we get closer well have a better view of what the plan might be at that point but i think youll see us take capital ratios up here sequentially and deploying to the loan growth for the foreseeable future betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then you talked a bit already about the credit and whats going on with the corporate side could you give us a sense on the consumer book what youre seeing is there any differentiation at all between either fico bands income bands or whether or not youre a housing youre a homeowner or a renter any dynamics there would be helpful thanks richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey betsy its rich i can take that one on the consumer side what you see as we talked about in some of the previous calls just a little bit of increasing in the delinquencies just in many respects because theyve been running at such artificially low levels given the deferral business deferrals in and the stimulus in i would say in general though those books are performing very well we have maintained our fico disciplines across the board and with increasing auto pricing and increasing home rates weve also done a good job of keeping the loantovalues constant or coming down so we feel very good about where the consumer book is positioned right now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc betsy this is steve we publish our auto lending every quarter so you see new lending its super prime it just hasnt deviated more than or points and has generally drifted upwards over the last years and were super prime on the home side as well and then the rvmarine has an average just over like an fico so all of this is very low default frequency default expectation and its all secured so we feel very good on the consumer book as a whole huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks betsy operator our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so for zach somewhat of a theoretical question so if we look at the balance sheet the loantodeposit ratio is low which is keeping deposit betas very low at the moment youre hedging to stabilize loan yields when we think about incremental loan beta versus incremental deposit beta this is for you and the industry are we basically setting up where as we look out to the full year nim could be higher in just mechanically over but at some point we should expect your quarteroverquarter nim to start trending down through the year as deposit betas ultimately catch up zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc well first of all thanks for serving me up a theoretical question i love to take those appreciate you doing that look i think that our outlook and best forecast that i see is for continued nim expansion over the next few quarters and if you sort of stretch the forecast out if you use the forward yield curve as guidance that continues out into the middle part of then starts to stabilize my forecast doesnt show contraction anything material just more kind of bouncing along a flat line as we get kind of further out into time obviously you noted in your question and i quipped about it it is a little theoretical as you start to forecast on forecast on forecast you get a little too far but thats the expectation that weve got steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got you and in response to johns question i just want to understand your answer you said you thought your deposit beta could be higher this cycle than the prior cycle is that right zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 no thats not what i said i think generally continue to be tracking around to the same level as the last cycle i think the beta sort of trends over time and that was the point i was trying to make initially in the early stages of the cycle its quite low and thats certainly what we saw in the second quarter less than beta in the second quarter i think the beta will accelerate as the rate environment and cycle continues but in totality on a cumulative basis still seeing generally the same kind of trends and outlook as we have seen in the last cycle steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc in the last okay got it thanks and then for steve so theres quite a bit of talk about companies onshoring supply chains right back to the us im curious what youre seeing on the ground and im not really talking about the intel plant but beyond that is this something that youre starting to see or is this just really a talking point at this point thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steve its occurring its been occurring i think if anything what were even seeing this year with china shutdown episodically with covid its just reinforcing so its supply chain nearshore or onshore and were getting some of that benefit here in the midwest and i suspect probably in the southeast southwest as well i think thats going to continue the supply chains have gotten better in some industries but still in most are a problem and that level of investment required is reflected in our equipment finance results we had a record second quarter and expect to have a very strong second half usually our second half is better than the first half so the teams are seeing a lot of investment reshoring is certainly a meaningful portion of it zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc the other thing ill just this is zach let me just tack on the other kind of secular phenomenon and i think its going to be a tailwind for the industry broadly and for commercial banking space the investment in property plant equipment to deal with labor supply constraints which are not going away anytime soon and are really driving significant corporate level investments in automation technology and things of that nature steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for all the color stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey good morning guys noticing the strong loan growth this quarter overall and keeping the guide for the year as i flip through the slide deck i notice that the originations on some of the consumer buckets are understandably smaller than they had been i just want to ask you to flesh out again as you think forward about commercial huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 growth versus consumer growth are there any changes you guys are making in either underwriting criteria or what you want to put on the books and how do you expect commercial versus consumer growth to look going forward overall thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure this is zach ill take that one and see if my colleagues want to tack on throughout the course of answering your question generally as i noted and you noted in your question continue to expect highsingledigit loan growth by q4 were actually running above that level right now q2 was about a annualized indiscernible which gives us the opportunity to optimize our capital allocation and really dial in the longterm return of the asset growth as we go throughout the balance of this year which we feel really good about to be in that position the nature of the growth going forward would be pretty similar to what weve seen in the first half of this year that is commercialled driven by production and consumer growing but slower and i think its corroborated by what were seeing in the particularly in commercial loan pipelines up i dont think we mentioned up quarter overquarter yearoveryear in our late stage commercial pipeline so notwithstanding the economic headlines our clients are still investing theres still opportunity to grow on the consumer side were going to see slower growth in residential mortgage than we saw in the first half as we go into the second half and auto and rvmarine should continue to contribute although at a slower level so i think perhaps a modest shift toward commercial but generally pretty similar to the nature of the growth we saw in the first half stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ken ill just tack on a little bit with mortgage rates up refi volumes down youre seeing the mortgage numbers everywhere so some of the home lending at least on the mortgage side will abate maybe partially offset with ph heloc but the consumer side i think will tend to be a little less robust than it has been at the same time the sheer scale of the opportunities we have in these national businesses with tcf are really extraordinary so the inventory finances is like number two to one of the big four nationally and that just has great upside for us as supply chains get worked out we talked before about auto floorplan thats almost a billion number for us as it normalizes so theres opportunity a bit in the utilization rate changes we saw a little bit of that in the second quarter theres a lot of opportunity in utilization rate changes but the growth dynamics here in these national businesses or new markets are very very good weve got over new business colleagues in minnesota and colorado as i mentioned earlier and that activity is bearing fruit and will continue to be a source of growth for us as well so very wellpositioned zach gave you the closedin pipeline as of contemporary week but the total commercial pipeline is almost double what it was a year ago so a lot of opportunities in front of us ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it great thank you steve and then just one more follow just drill down into auto just some peers and this isnt new some peers are saying that things are getting tougher on spreads and have pulled the way you guys tend to get that premium to the market and just with the changing dynamics going on in terms of residual values and new versus used mix can you just talk about some of the dynamics there in terms of the ability to huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 continue to produce and originate at the same level and how youre expecting credit to act as well underneath thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well the credit we think will have a very consistent performance because weve been so disciplined for more than a decade so we dont expect to see any significant credit issues emerging out of auto or rvmarine for that matter because thats an plus average fico so very very low default frequencies and that drives more than valuation used car valuation or other equivalent metrics much more to our business line than it has to most because frankly we just dont have that many repossessions as we think about the business going forward theres always a lag as rates rise in terms of getting pricing at a typical level and theres always a benefit as rates fall so were dynamically pricing actually we dont focus on market share its about return and risk and well continue to do that but weve been in this business for almost threequarters of century its performed very very well for us and we expect it will continue to do so thanks for your question ken next question operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim how are you ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good hey zach just wanted to follow up on your expense guide twopart question one as we think about your strategic target efficiency ratio just talk to us in terms of areas of investments as we look forward from here and where youre flexing expenses in terms of savings and whether there is a case to be made that the efficiency ratio normalize for whatever rate backdrop could be structurally lower than your current target zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks for the questions theres a lot to unpack in expenses so im glad you gave me the opportunity to do that i think now that we have delivered the cost synergies fully its in the run rate were back to managing expenses on an ongoing basis as the business grows and with the goal toward continuing to drive positive operating leverage and modulating expenses relative to revenue while we selffund the key investments in our strategic initiatives to sustain them and those are not changed from what weve had before well continue to do it to build out key commercial capabilities build our critical fee businesses and payments capital markets wealth and i think continue to build terrific digital and overall product capabilities within our consumer and business banking functions so those are the priorities well keep investing in them aligned with clearly what steve was just mentioning in terms of the terrific momentum we have in the tcf expansion opportunities huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 the efficiency ratio is an outcome frankly and our goal is really in the end to drive ppnr and just continue to expand profitability over time with that being said i do think efficiency ratio could very well trend lower here just given where the rate environment is going and well see where that goes ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just a separate question on in your slide deck slide you talk about digital engagement or originations both consumer commercial deposit origination seem to have peaked a few quarters ago and declined just wondering if anything to read in there and talk to us in terms of the investments youre making on the digital side from a client onboarding acquisition perspective zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so i think in terms of the investments were making in digital should continue and its all about channel development internal process efficiency and weve got as we have had in the past a series of interesting new product developments that are on our roadmap that i i wont steal the thunder on now but youll see them come through into the market over time as we launch them were always throttling the dials of where were directing our marketing funding and that changes the mix of online versus offline account acquisition over time but in the end its all about driving the most value ultimately from the accounts in terms of depth of relationship and ultimately customer lifetime value and we feel really good where that is trending frankly ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc zach a theoretical question for you zach huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc okay jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc do you feel like theres an upper limit on your margin ive covered your company for a long time and i always think like 350ish gets a little bit toppy on your margin but is it possible to see similar types of sequential jumps in the margin if we get another basis points next week or is there something in your business mix that would prevent that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc if you see the room here were seeing a lot of heads nodding and pleasured with your question so thanks for asking it i mean i think look the reality is that there is no top its a function of where the interest rate environment goes right and i think it could go higher with that being said i think realistically what youre saying kind of a realistic range is right for the foreseeable future and certainly as we do our modeling based on the yield curve where it is right now we see continued expansion as i mentioned in one of the questions earlier for the next few quarters and then beginning to flatten out as you get into kind of the middle part of and beyond again based on the trajectory of the yield curve right now jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then steve a question for you acquisition appetite its probably an annoying question but youve done some fee businesses and i think youve done well with those youve done well with tcf you did fine with firstmerit any interest at all in depositories or is that just off the table given the regulatory environment stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we have a lot of opportunity to achieve with tcf so our expectation is just to continue to focus on that and if there is some ancillary fee businesses that help us in payments or wealth or capital markets those would be of interest to us but weve got a lot of upside going forward over the next couple of years and i dont know how to think about the regulatory environment for us we got approved in record time the last time with tcf and we had the same experience with firstmerit and that should be some indication of our standing and dfast would be yet another indication of the outperformance every time above median is a reflection of the quality of the portfolio so were seeing outstanding and have been so all of that suggests were able to do things if we choose to but our focus will continue to be drive the revenue opportunity from the tcf combination jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough thanks guys zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks jon huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 operator our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james please proceed with your question david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning dave zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning dave david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc the expected prepandemic dayone cecl reserve was much lower much lower for legacy huntington and even much lower for tcf than legacy huntington given its shorter duration loan portfolio than your current reserve level so with the economic forecast at very healthy levels here just want to see why maybe your reserve today is higher than where it was prepandemic richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc the prepandemic i mean i think you have to go back i mean thats over two years ago so its a point in time this is always a point in time the portfolio has mix has shifted over times as well we had a big oil and gas portfolio that was part of cecl day one thats not here anymore weve got more real estate today than we had back then so a lot of it is a function of just the makeup of the portfolio and as were sitting here today were looking potentially in a recession where i think if you went back to january of you didnt have that on the horizon potentially near term so its a combination of everything the mechanics of cecl you look at it every quarter and you run your models and you make subjective adjustments where do you think the models might be not capturing everything and as we sit here at the end of the second quarter we had come down for six consecutive quarters prior to this one and just thought it was time to take a little bit of a pause and see where things shake out so its a quarterbyquarter analysis we do and its really hard to go back to cecl day one and say this is a goal or an objective to get there david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for providing that color and then steve you mentioned or talked a little bit about some of the revenue synergies with tcf and i sense your excitement there but is there any way you can put numbers behind it either in incremental loan growth with any of the categories or level of dollars of revenue that you think can be created stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 well we havent given guidance along those lines david but youre hearing us allude to it in terms of equipment finance inventory finance the reference as stated tcf didnt do sba lending in colorado or minnesota in fact they didnt do ci lending or small business lending in colorado so you get a lot of or for that matter wealth in either market so theres a lot of investment that has been made that early on is producing and i think just gets bigger and better as we scale those businesses in those markets and then we are a force in michigan we were having great growth in michigan and were now able to run a full set of plays in chicago so you have those combinations of regional markets our equipment finance number seven nationally i think well be better than that on a relative position by the end of the year based on the volumes we see so weve got a lot of synergy thats been achieved and weve been emphasizing ocr we have a much better product set on both the consumer and commercial side and that emphasis will continue to translate into revenue growth in capital markets card and other businesses fee businesses for us treasury management et cetera as we go forward well give some thought to trying to mention that over time for you and others but at this point we havent done so david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc great thank you i appreciate the additional color steve stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks dave operator our next question is from erika najarian with ubs please state your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just had a followup question on how yields the yield trajectory zach the increase in afs yields was particularly eyepopping was that just a function of the starting point of ph is just so low or was there anything sort of more onetime in nature there and additionally i noticed that ci yields were only up bps in the quarter and im wondering if you expect that loan beta to accelerate over the next few quarters zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah nothing unusual in the first category you talked about i think were just seeing that continued trend through and certainly in our securities portfolio broadly really benefiting from expanding yields and just the reinvestment of the cash flows overall broadly speaking across the loan categories were seeing nice trends in new money yield with gross yields really benefiting as the yield curve is expanding here environment is still competitive and so its still a factor but were seeing new money rates expand in almost every major product line across the board around bps to give you a sense overall from q1 to q2 and yeah i think that the average rate increase in q2 versus q1 was relatively modest i think were going to see coming through related to your ci question in q3 is more just given again the timing of the rate moves and the moves and so for late in the quarter versus what well see on average for q3 huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and just a followup question clearly the market has priced in started to price in a mild downturn some sort of downturn over the near term could you remind us when you printed an acl ratio of in what kind of unemployment rate were you assuming then and if we think about a mild downturn over the next to months how much more will your acl ratio climb from what seems to already be a pretty nice level of stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah i mean as it relates to where we were a couple of years ago id have to go back and take that out i would just say that we use multiple scenarios and each one is going to have embedded assumptions around gdp and unemployment and those are going to run a pretty wide range but its the mix the weighted average of all those that we could track down zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc and this is zach ill just tack on i would not draw sort of a direct correlation in that way i think it theres just too many other factors that go into it and i think that its not even necessarily the case that it would go up i think it really depends on i think what the trajectory is and what the outlook is across the various scenarios also clearly the depth and duration of any economic softening is the most important factor stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well and i think the other thing that you have to look at is the with cecl its really hard to predict where the actual level of reserves is going to go because not only is that a function of the portfolio but its also a function of loan growth so youve got to build that in so this quarter we kept the acl coverage flat but the dollars indiscernible because of the loan growth we experienced so theres a few moving pieces in there but i would say entering into a potential downturn with a position of strength we would think would mitigate any large increases going forward erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you so much stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks erika operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning scott zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i was hoping you might be able to sort of update your thoughts on the revenue contributions from capstone and torana and i know you had the million contribution from capstone in the second quarter i think the zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co disclosures you offered previously on that one in particular were based on prior years performance so just any updated thoughts now that theyre officially under the umbrella zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so thanks for the question scott and just we couldnt be more pleased about closing both of those acquisitions torana is relatively small capstone is a very scaled business as weve talked about and just what an amazing fit for our capital markets business and not only bring on a great run rate but the opportunity to expand that business within the huntington franchise is really really significant so were thrilled about it at this point our current forecasts are around that same kind of run rate here over the next couple of quarters and i think well well see the synergies start to manifest as we get out further into time but really excited about that i think torana over time will grow a relatively small impact in this year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so scott i think zach gave you like a million threeyear average revenue zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc correct huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and thats r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the reference point to your question i would tell you they have a very good pipeline for the third quarter and they had a good second quarter and as we integrate and bring them into our customer base we know them weve worked together this is a really good cultural fit well look to grow revenues off that base zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer
