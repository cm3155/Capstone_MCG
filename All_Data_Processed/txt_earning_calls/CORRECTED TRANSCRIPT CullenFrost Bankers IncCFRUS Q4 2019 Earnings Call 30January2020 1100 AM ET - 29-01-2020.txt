grade and higher were million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter of this year and million in the fourth quarter last year the increase in the fourth quarter related primarily to the energy portfolio energyrelated problem loans were million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to million for the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of last year the energyrelated problem loan total is mostly attributable to three borrowers with whom weve been working for several quarters energy loans in general represented of our portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter up from the previous quarter but well below our peak of more than in our focus for commercial loans continues to be on consistent and balanced growth including both the core component which we define as lending relationships under million in size as well as larger relationships while maintaining our quality standards the balance between these relationships went from larger and core at the end of to larger and core at the end of the movement towards larger loans in was mostly due to activity in the fourth quarter where some quality new energy relationships were added after exiting a number of credits during the year new relationships increased versus the fourth quarter of a year ago cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 the dollar amount of new loan commitments booked during the fourth quarter was up sharply increasing from a year ago and from the prior quarter even excluding the strong energy growth we saw in the fourth quarter new loan commitments grew versus a year ago and from the prior quarter and represented good increases in both ci and cre that said quality deals are hard to come by in we booked just more loan commitments compared to despite looking at more deals in cre we saw our percentage of deals lost structure increase from in to in our weighted current active loan pipeline in the fourth quarter was up by about overall compared to the prior quarter and was driven by a growth in ci opportunities of the new financial centers that weve opened so far in the houston region four were opened in the fourth quarter we expect to open one more houston area financial center in the current quarter on our way to a total of new financial centers and weve already hired more than of the approximately employees we expect to staff this expansion those new financial center openings benefit both commercial and consumer banking lets look at our consumer business we added almost net new customers consumer customers in an increase of from a year ago that represented a increase in the total number of consumer customers all of it representing organic growth in the fourth quarter of our

our overall strategy of sustainable organic growth is serving us well the interest rate environment continues to present challenges to our industry but we remain focused on the fundamentals and growing our lines of business in line with our quality standards had its share of challenges but also had its share of achievements besides adding the new financial centers in houston that i mentioned we also expanded into a completely new market where we opened our first financial center in victoria texas and we completed our corporate headquarters move to the new frost tower in downtown san antonio in the culmination of a process that began six years ago our commitment to customer service was confirmed when frost received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction in texas and jd

with area unemployment remaining at permian basin payrolls remained flat through november and the unemployment rate has ticked up in recent months while the rig count has generally declined in recent months oil production has continued to increase permian region job declines in the mining manufacturing and government sectors were offset by job growth in the leisure and hospitality professional and

job growth in the permian region november unemployment remained low at for the second consecutive month our net interest margin percentage for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease primarily resulted from lower yields on loans and balances at the fed as well as an increase in the proportion of balances at the fed as a percentage of earning assets partially offset by lower funding costs the taxable equivalent loan yield for the fourth quarter was down basis points from the third order impacted by the lower rate environment with september and october fed rate cuts the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the fourth quarter up about million from the third quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 average of billion the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the fourth quarter down basis points from the third quarter our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the fourth quarter up about million from the third quarter the municipal portfolio had a taxable equivalent yield for the fourth quarter of flat with the previous quarter at the end of the fourth quarter about twothirds of the municipal portfolio was psfinsured during the fourth quarter approximately billion of our treasury securities that were yielding about matured as insurance against the potential backdrop of flat to down rates for an extended period of time we made the decision to add duration to our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter we purchased about billion in securities to replace the treasuries that matured during the quarter we purchased million in 30year treasuries yielding about approximately million in agency mortgage backed securities yielding about and about million in municipal securities with a te yields of as a result of the maturities and purchases i just mentioned the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the quarter was years compared to years last quarter looking at our funding sources the cost of total deposits for the fourth quarter was basis points down basis points from the third quarter the combined cost of the cost of combined fed funds purchase and repurchase agreement which consist primarily of customer repos decreased basis points to for the fourth quarter from in the previous quarter those balances averaged about billion during the fourth quarter up about million from the previous quarter moving to noninterest expense total noninterest expense for the quarter increased approximately million or compared to the fourth quarter last year excluding the impact of the houston expansion and the operating costs associated with our headquarters moving downtown san antonio noninterest expense growth would have been approximately regarding the outlook for the fullyear of the estimates for fullyear earnings we currently believe that those estimates for earnings the factset mean of is reasonable so again regarding the estimates for fullyear earnings we currently believe that the factset mean of is reasonable our assumptions do not include any rate cuts in with that ill turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry now well open up the call for questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from peter winter with wedbush your line is open peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc good morning peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i was just wondering can you talk about what the loan outlook is for you guys for i think before youve targeted highsingle digits and im just wondering what the outlook is going forward phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think its fairly consistent with that it may be depend on your definition of high but certainly over is what wed shoot for and i dont think it will be double digits so thats as close i think ill get to it peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then one of your competitors the other day talked about this increased competition from the nonbank players and it resulted in a very high level of paydowns and payoffs im just wondering what youre seeing on a competition level in your market phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah competition continues to be tough and its mainly around structure but its i wouldnt relate it just to non bank competition i think ive said before its been big banks small banks it has been some nonbank competition as well and i think from the people ive talked to in the industry thats sort of a national thing people are searching for yield and its mainly around guarantees and advance rates and those type of things and as i said we lost more deals to structure on particularly real estate this year than last year were at loss due to structure versus a year ago so its some factor its not the only factor the nonbanks peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 and then just one more housekeeping jerry in other income i know it can be volatile but there was a big increase relative to the past two quarters im just wondering there was anything unusual this quarter jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc i think we had a stronger capital markets underwriting fees during the quarter those were up million compared to the fourth quarter last year and we had about million on an insurance claim that we got paid on i think those are the two things that stand out peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks very much operator next question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust your line is open jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc my question is on credit can you just talk about the level of energy chargeoffs you saw during the fourth quarter and for the entire year in and what you think is likely over the next few quarters given problem loans have gone up pretty significantly in that sector phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think just in general were coming to the end of this process of moving through ph this leg most weve got two large energy credits and nonperformers both around say million a little over million and theyve been working those things weve been working those things out for a while in one case three years or so and the other a long period of time i think were getting close to the point where a final resolution for those is going to happen i dont know when it will be exactly but i think its sooner rather than later it could be the first quarter it could be after that and so my gut tells me that therell be some chargeoffs related to those a good amount of it reserved for already but maybe not all and probably not all of it given whats been happening with the discount rates in the energy space it has been pretty wellknown by everybody over the last couple of quarters cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 so i think well see higher energy chargeoffs but its really related to the culmination of these deals that have been working for a long time as opposed to anything happening with the new credits because there has been some weakness in the sector does it make sense jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc let me just ask a followup so in terms of the new problem loans that came in during fourth quarter what kind of gives you confidence that that kind of credit migration trend is i guess inflecting phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well i mean the one that was rated a problem in the fourth quarter i mean we have talked about it last quarter it was one that was on watch before and the reason we put it there is because their plan calls for selling assets and we know that its a difficult environment its a difficult environment to do that now theyve got strategic properties and early results on what they saw initially was pretty good but its not a great environment to be selling assets and so wed just be seeing how that works over time but we decided indiscernible problem but again like i said early results on that are pretty good right now jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc jennifer in the fourth quarter net chargeoffs on energy were million jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay fine and for the year jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc for the year im seeing it looks like a little north of million jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and just one more question on noninterest expenses just wondering jerry if you think youll see a similar level of expense growth this year given youre trying to complete the houston expansion i guess you got what more offices jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc right well we dont give specific line item guidance but jennifer what i would point you to is our fourth quarter to fourth quarter as reported growth percentage and expenses and to me thats really representative of our expectations going into obviously we as a group are all focused on trying to manage expenses in this environment of trying to grow the business and in trying to being faced with some technology debt if you will its cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 really important for us to focus on expenses but right now i would take that fourth quarter to fourth quarter growth as kind of in the ballpark of our current expectations jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everybody phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc id like to start with the margins and nim was obviously down a lot given how much libor and shortterm rates move down the quarter how are you ph think about the forward nim from here as im looking out in that fourth quarter i think were at in the fourth quarter and the way i we are not projecting any rate cuts like i said so to me kind of what im looking at is wed be flattish to maybe up just slightly but really flat is what im thinking for compared to the fourth quarter of percentagewise steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes thats helpful and then thank you on the houston branches i know its early but for the branches you have opened can you talk about the growth trends youre seeing so far is it roughly in line with expectations and then costs for the branches is it coming out where you thought it would be phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think were happy with what weve seen versus what we expected the cost number i think is a little bit less than we had thought it would be just because we had many of them that were pushed near the end of the year so that was really just more of a timing thing and were seeing good growth in households probably seeing a little bit better growth in households than we expected a little bit better loan growth than we expected a little bit less cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 deposit levels than we had expected but im not really worried about that as we get these relationships and i think well see that be in line with what we were expecting to see the main thing im focused on is whats happening with relationships and those were better than we anticipated so im not discouraged at all in fact im encouraged by what were doing and how our people are executing another good thing about it is that weve hired some great people and were getting people that are willing to buy into our culture and seasoned bankers i think the average relationships managers if i recall was around years so these are real real solid people steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc yeah and as phil mentioned we had kind of disclosed the and we did a negative impact on it was just a little bit better than we expected and as he mentioned a lot of that was driven by the timing of the openings and for were projecting that expansion its going to be the worst in the second year obviously and so were expecting a hit of related to the houston expansion in with improvements after that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats very helpful and then finally for phil so we saw another moe earlier this week is an moe something that you would consider and i know the culture is so strong at the company it really differentiates you how do you think about an moe for cullenfrost thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well of course no ceo will talk about that kind of things but ill just tell you what ive said consistently and ill say it again and that is that you know that a rollup is not something that were interested in that were executing an organic strategy and i think the risk and the payoff is lower on the organic strategy and the payoff is better were investing with our income statement as opposed to investing with our balance sheet the best use of an acquisition for a company like ours is really one thats not a rollup but puts you in a position to do an acquisition puts you in a position to do organic growth from that point forward and so but as i said before those things dont happen very often they come along infrequently the last time we did that was when ph we moved out to the midland and odessa market with wnp about six years ago so acquisitions are not on our radar screen whats on our radar screen is how were growing the company and growing the relationships every day and thats the thing were focused on steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking all my questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc you bet operator operator instructions your next question comes from brady gailey with kbw your line is open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the energy loan loss reserve last quarter was about million it was about did that i know you had some problem energy loans ph floating in this quarter but did that change much on a linkedquarter basis jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc yeah we moved it up its about million percentage yeah so we were at million youre right and we moved that up to about million brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then when you take a step back and look at houston it was a little under dilutive to last year its dilutive to this year when will that hit breakeven and how many years until you will recoup all those losses phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc well the breakeven as we said before on average for these locations has been about months jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc right cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc think months so anyone can do the math on that lay that out and sort of see when those tipping points occur i think one thing to keep in mind is this really in should be the highest hit so to the extent that youre seeing a lower burn rate if you will even for the branches that are still maturing you can add some momentum from where weve been say in so i see the momentum in terms of its contribution towards earnings increases should begin in that said they all have to breakeven and get to the point where they grow earnings so that happens in months on average so just look at when were opening them and youll make your assumption there and see when you think those turn around brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then lastly phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc lastly for me youve hired i think you said youve hired employees out of the that are planned out of the that youve hired how many of those were commercial lenders roughly phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc about i would say of them are so in round numbers brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thanks guys operator next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jon jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc good morning jon cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a couple followups one on bradys question on kind of versus do you expect to have all the hiring done and essentially the compensation and some of the facilities expenses in the run rate actually in expense run rate jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc yes youre saying do we expect to have most of that in jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc because our current plan is and one may fall out into but our current plan is to have those all opened by the end of this year and as far as the bankers are concerned we typically try to hire a lot of the staff there six months before and so the locations were kind of moving along this year with the expectation i think phil mentioned that we were projecting one this quarter i think were projecting five in the second quarter so yeah therell be a you wont be at run rate but youll get the bulk of it in jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay okay good that helps and then jerry as long as youre there last quarter you talked about extending duration a bit you did so this quarter curious if theres more to come for you in that area and then maybe talk about the impact and how you think about a little flatter curve that were facing right now jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc i think there is were continuing to have conversations i think the plan is to continue to add duration i think i said we bought million in treasuries were thinking about potentially if the market makes sense for us well do another million there our focus really for the year is probably less on municipal securities than it has been historically we bought i think i said million in mortgagebacked during the quarter and thats probably kind of where were headed as far as percentage wise were probably moving more towards mortgagebacked right now is the current plan cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc and really i think you talked about a flatter yield curve really what we did this was really kind of a proactive move kind of an insurance were kind of looking at where our exposure is and our exposure was to flat rate and so from our end it made sense for us to extend duration through our investment portfolio if we get the opportunity on the loan portfolio side we may decide to do something there but right now yeah i think that thats our plan jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thank you for that and then phil just the commercial pipeline you talked about up sequentially with ci as the driver phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then earlier you were talking about larger versus smaller go ahead phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah you talked about larger versus smaller im just that pipeline increase can you talk about would you characterize that as deep and broad commercial strength or would you say its energydriven or help us understand that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think its i think the increase in energy in the quarter was as much as it was was just an anomaly jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 i mean we had some opportunity to put on some really great relationships and weve been moving out of relationships ones which we didnt think were right for us or deep enough for us throughout the year and so we just had a number of those hit i would expect that i dont have the energy pipeline percentage of that growth at ci in front of me but i dont expect a change in our focus on core over time and youll have dislocations like you saw in the fourth quarter in a particular segment sometimes it might be commercial real estate sometimes so i dont expect it to be much different and we were looking again were not getting out of large deals were good at we want to do them this core thing is about balance in the portfolio its working on the core and on the large deals so i expect this to continue to be in balance there were focused on it ill tell you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right the basic message is that its broad its not just energy in terms of what you do in commercial phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah yeah yeah no no no we havent changed our focus there absolutely jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah operator your next question comes from rahul patil with evercore isi your line is open rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc thanks i just want to drill down on the expenses a little bit i know you talked about fourth quarter reported expense growth yearoveryear that was around that is kind of a good run rate going into and so youre basically guiding to a to yearoveryear growth in expenses last quarter you talked about expenses on a reported basis will be north of growth so what has changed why that incremental growth in jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc i said somebody threw out the number and i just said its going to be north of that so we didnt really give any specific guidance what ill say is really our outlook for expenses really hasnt changed significantly for the houston expansion of course has been part of it you saw a big increase in our technology expenses between the third quarter and the fourth quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 we had really been projecting that to happen earlier in those projects actually didnt get closed out until the fourth quarter and so they had a big impact on the fourth quarter but no i mean our outlook for expenses between last quarter and this quarter as it relates to hasnt changed significantly rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay thats fair then the other thing is that you talked about eps your reason youre comfortable with the consensus eps of consensus right now is not modeling a expense growth right loan growth in that range that is essentially where everybody is thinking about loan growth for you guys nim outlook appears to be slightly better last time you said youve probably noticed a downward trajectory through now youre saying flattish im just trying to get a sense for where exactly in the consensus number is are you comfortable whats driving that comfort level right now given that expenses are probably edging high jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc to be quite honest with you we dont spend our time analyzing where consensus is at we look at the bottom line number and thats the number that were seeing in factset and based on that number were comfortable with the overall projection to be honest with you ive given you a little bit more color than we typically do trying to help there but we dont give specific line item guidance rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay and just one last question how are you guys thinking about day provisioning under cecl jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc i think that at the end of the day from a cecl standpoint we would expect that the future of provisions theyre going to continue to be impacted by chargeoffs the mix of loan growth of course the forecasted economic environment and other factors and at this point theres obviously a lot to be determined to what happens by the time that first quarter provision is concerned but were not too worried about it at this point but a lot of it will be dependent on what the environment looks like at that point rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from matt olney with stephens your line is open matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah thanks for taking my question just want to follow up on the consumer loan portfolio i know its a pretty small part of the overall portfolio but if we go back a few years ago the consumer portfolio had some pretty strong growth and it has since slowed down quite a bit so can you just talk more about that portfolio what cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 drove the growth a few years ago and whats driven the slowdown more recently and we have seen some higher charge offs in that book more recently anything to note there thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah the main component of the portfolio that is slowing in fact has declined some yearoveryear has been in the personal lines of credit unsecured lines of credit the losses that youre seeing there really related to some loans to some individuals whose companies had some issues and weve tightened up in that area on plcs and in the underwriting there so youre seeing that drop and so we dont expect that to be a systemic or recurring issue weve actually had really good growth as it relates to the consumer real estate part of that portfolio which includes home equity loans home improvement loans et cetera and that continues to grow and we were happy with that so really what youre seeing is really an offset on one side of the portfolio again in personal lines of credit offsetting what is good growth in the consumer real estate which has extremely great credit metrics and great performance matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats all from me thank you phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc all right thank you operator next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone i just had two quick followups the first on the deposit side why did you guys have such strong growth in average deposits do you have any color there jerry salinas a chief financial officer group executive vice president cullenfrost bankers inc well we really have had good growth in the second quarter excuse me the second part of the year its something weve obviously been focused on let me go here and just pull it i think that hold on let me see specifically what categories are growing here on a linkedquarter basis some of it was driven by good increases obviously in the ci category so if youre looking at a linkedquarter basis the fourth quarter for us is always stronger i think the fourth quarter this year was stronger than normal like i said some of that started in the third quarter and so its been in the ci the commercial deposits i think some of it has to do with rates some of it has to do with volatility but i think that we continue to make the calls that we need to make we continue to see growth in new customers we continue to be focused on the things that we need to do to grow the business we had during the starting in as rates started to go up over basis points we were starting to have challenges on the commercial dda we were seeing some of those balances leave as i think the opportunity cost of keeping balances in dda accounts got too expensive and cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 i think were starting to were proactively doing some things to get some of that back on the balance sheet but in addition to that i think just the lower rate environment is probably helping us there and like i said were continuing to focus on building those new relationships weve had great from the interest bearing side weve had good growth in the jumbo deposits or jumbo cds weve got a pretty competitive rate there and those continue to go up but ive really been impressed also with the growth that weve seen and interest on checking really to be honest with you so really just weve had some good augmentation from our existing customers but weve also had addition of new customers so knock on wood were pretty
