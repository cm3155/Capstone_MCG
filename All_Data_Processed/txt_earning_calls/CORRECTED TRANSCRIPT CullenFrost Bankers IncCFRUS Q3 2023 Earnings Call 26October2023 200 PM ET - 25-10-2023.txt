cullenfrost bankers inc thanks ab good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us today ill review the third quarter results for cullenfrost jerry is going to make some additional comments and then were going to open it up for your questions in the third quarter cullenfrost earned million or a share compared with earnings of million or a share reported in the same quarter last year our return on average assets and average common equity in the third quarter were and respectively and that compares with and for the same period last year this solid performance can be attributed to the execution of our sustainable organic growth strategy and the commitment to our culture that develops deep customer relationships and provides worldclass customer service and all this happens because of the hard work and dedication of our frost bank staff as in the past our balance sheet and our liquidity levels remained strong as an example at quarter end our cash liquidity deferred equaled of our deposit base also during the quarter cullenfrost did not take on any federal home loan bank advances participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing access any broker deposits or utilize any reciprocal deposit arrangement to build insured deposit percentages let me also say our available for sale portfolio represents of our portfolio at quarter end so in short basically with our balance sheet what you see is what you get our average deposits were stable in third quarter at billion less than a percent change from the previous quarter average loans grew to billion in the third quarter compared to billion in the second quarter an annualized growth rate of as i mentioned were laserfocused on our efforts to achieve organic growth and im very pleased with our results for example to update you on our physical expansion efforts for our combined houston expansions we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal as of quarter end expansion loans represented and deposits represented of our total houston market presence for the dallas market we stand at of deposit goal of loan goal and of our new household goal while still relatively early in this effort expansion loans and deposits represent approximately respectively of dallas market totals and were excited about our new austin expansion effort which has opened the first of planned locations to double our presence in that market but beyond these overall numbers i wanted to take you a little deeper into the character of the expansion business for example in houston we stand at billion in deposits and billion in loans our deposit mix is commercial and consumer essentially mirroring our company profile twothirds of the deposit relationships are under million and only four are over million loans are73 commercial consumer and only eight customers have over million similarly in dallas of our million in deposits are consumer versus commercial and of those deposits were under million no relationships over million our million in loans are consumer and commercial which i think is remarkable the reason i labored through that detail is to show you that the kind of business weve been successful generating in our expansion is core stable grassroots business which i believe will generate tremendous value over an extended period of time im very pleased with the results of these efforts and i believe that this strategy is both scalable and durable and im convinced well be doing this for a long time cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 looking at our consumer banking business we continue to see outstanding organic growth we added net new checking households in the quarter bringing the yeartodate total to a improvement on yeartodate results to give a perspective of the power and durability of our organic growth let me point out that in the past months weve added net new consumer checking households this means we grew our core customer base by in just three years we believe these are industryleading numbers and represent tangible evidence that the customer experience we offer and the reputation weve built set us up to be successfully competitive as we look at these new households we see that the quality of the growth is also high a higher percentage of the accounts are active the balances are healthy and the growth is balanced across all the segments we serve these factors are evidence that the growth is sustainable and beneficial consumer loan balances outstanding were billion at the end of the quarter growing yearoveryear in the third quarter alone balances increased million or from the second quarter this robust growth was driven by our home equity products in a market where its becoming increasingly expensive to buy many families are deciding to stay and fix up their home and weve got the right products and services and relationships to help at this time we have a long history of credit quality in the consumer bank similar to what youre used to hearing about on the commercial side and the weighted average credit score on the portfolio is delinquencies are low and stable at about basis points chargeoffs are also low and stable at basis points for the year also as weve noted were excited about the prospects for our new mortgage product which is in its very early stages but just recently opened up to all our markets in the state now looking at our commercial business i think its an interesting story our new opportunities for the quarter were strong but they were down from the second quarter however that was because our second quarter new opportunities were at alltime high after the dislocations brought on by the svb situation and as you would expect our declines for deals were also high and were almost half times our quarterly average now looking at the third quarter and focusing on our weighted pipeline that weighted pipeline is up from last quarter and its our highest of all time at billion our previous high was during the second quarter of at billion the increase comes from all categories both customers up and prospects up both core which we define as relationships under million and large core up large up and both ci up and cre up credit quality continues to be good by historical standards with classified and nonaccrual assets flat and net chargeoffs down quarteroverquarter nonaccrual loans totaled million at the end of the third quarter compared with million at the end of the second quarter essentially flat for the quarter the third quarter figure represents just basis points of total loans and basis points of total assets problem loans which we define as risk grade or higher totaled million at the end of the third quarter thats up from million at the end of the second quarter and million this time last year virtually all of the linkedquarter growth was in the oaem risk category or grade net chargeoffs for the third quarter were million they were down from million in the second quarter annualized net chargeoffs for the third quarter represent basis points of average loans and yeartodate annualized net chargeoffs are basis points of average loans which is below historic averages cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 regarding commercial real estate our overall portfolio remains stable with steady operating performance across all types and acceptable debt service coverage ratios and loan to values within this portfolio what wed consider to be the major categories of investor cre that is office multifamily retail and industrial as example totaled billion or of cre loans outstanding and are flat quarteroverquarter our investor cre portfolio has held up well with the average performance metrics remaining essentially unchanged quarteroverquarter and exhibiting an overall loan to value of about loan to cost of about and acceptable reported debt service coverage ratios higher interest rates continue to be a challenge for our cre borrowers and have impacted performance of some project as compared to original ph performers however on average were comfortable with the quality of the portfolio as an example the investor office portfolio which has been top of mind since the pandemic had a balance of million at quarter end and exhibited an average loan to value of and an average debtservice coverage ratio of up slightly from last quarter of this portfolio is stabilized with healthy coverage levels and less than of the portfolio is considered spec with even these few projects being in strong submarkets with good leasing dynamics and strong experienced developers our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our borrowers and sponsors and the predominantly class a nature of our office building projects and again were glad to be operating in texas so in closing we remain optimistic for what lies ahead were capitalizing on opportunities and im proud of all our bankers as they accomplish all of this across all our communities now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil i wanted to start off first by talking a little bit about more about our houston expansion results as phil mentioned weve been very pleased with the volumes weve been able to achieve looking at the third quarter linkedquarter annualized growth in average balances for these locations was for deposits thats million growth linkedquarter and on loans a annualized growth or million quarterover quarter for loans im sorry the was for deposits and for the third quarter houston contributed to our quarterly eps now moving to our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter was down only 1basispoint from the reported last quarter some positives for the quarter included higher yields on loans and balances at the fed combined with higher loan volumes these positives were primarily offset by higher cost of deposits and customer repos compared to the second quarter looking at our investment portfolio the investment portfolio averaged billion during the third quarter down million from the second quarter during the quarter we did not make any material investment purchases and sold about million in municipal securities at a small net gain as we took advantage of market dislocations which allowed us to improve interest income going forward the net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was billion an increase of million from the billion reported at the end of the second quarter the taxable equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the third quarter was flat with the second quarter the taxable portfolio which averaged billion down approximately million from the prior quarter had a yield of up basis points from the prior quarter our tax exempt municipal portfolio cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 averaged about billion during the third quarter down million from the second quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of down basis point from the prior quarter at the end of the third quarter approximately of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was years up from years at the end of the second quarter impacted by duration extension in both our municipal and mbs agency portfolios looking at deposits on a linkedquarter basis average deposits of billion were basically flat with the previous quarter as they were only down million or we did continue to see a mix shift during the quarter as noninterestbearing demand deposits decreased million or while interestbearing deposits increased million or when compared to the previous quarter based on third quarter average balances noninterestbearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits were compared to in the second quarter noninterestbearing deposits totaled billion at the end of the quarter with of that amount being commercial demand deposits during the individual months of the third quarter we did see the average balances in the noninterestbearing accounts begin to stabilize during last quarters call i noted that julys average balance was down million from the june average the full monthtodate average for july was billion down only million from the june average our august average was flat with july and the september average was down only million to billion for october monthtodate through yesterday the average noninterestbearing deposit balance is billion down million from the september average looking at total interestbearing deposits theyve been relatively stable during the period average interest bearing deposits were billion during the quarter up million or from the second quarter for october monthtodate average the balance in interestbearing deposits through yesterday was billion up million from our september average we do continue to see a shift in the mix and interestbearing deposits to highercost cds from lowercost savings ioc and mma the cost of interestbearing deposits in the third quarter was up basis points from in the second quarter customer repos for the third quarter averaged billion down million from the billion averaged in the second quarter the cost of customer repos for the quarter was up basis points from the second quarter looking at our noninterest income on a linkedquarter basis i just wanted to point out a couple of items trust and investment management fees were down million or compared to the second quarter driven by decreases in estate fees of million real estate fees of and tax fees of partly offset by an increase in investment fees of estate fees and real estate fees can fluctuate based on the number of estate settled or properties sold respectively while tax fees by their nature are typically higher in the second quarter other charges commissions and fees were up million or compared to the second quarter impacted by increases in various accounts including money market income up letter of credit fees up and annuity income up other income was up million or when compared to the second quarter impacted by higher public finance underwriting fees up million and higher combined derivative and foreign exchange income up million cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 looking at our projection of full year total noninterest expenses we continue to expect total noninterest expense for the full year to increase at a percentage rate in the midteens over our reported levels this does not include the potential impact of the fdic special assessment which is not yet been finalized the effective tax rate for the first nine months of the year was our current expectation is that our fullyear effective tax rate for should approximate to but that can be affected by discrete items during this fourth quarter regarding the estimates for full year earnings our current projections dont include any additional changes to the fed funds rate through the rest of the year through the rest of given that rate assumption and our expectation of noninterest expense growth of midteens which does not include the impact of the fdic special assessment and given our strong performance this quarter we believe that the current indiscernible of analyst estimates of is too low with that ill turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thanks jerry and well open up for questions now question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so on the deposit side jerry to follow up where you just left off with the noninterestbearing that billion billion its pretty stable in fourth quarter we typically see some window dressing right from companies that it picks up a bit can we safely say that were now at a bottom for the noninterestbearing deposits cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc you know steven i think that certainly when i look at it i feel today versus three months ago feel a lot more comfortable with where theyre at obviously youve seen and i kind of tried to give that sort of color in my commentary we are seeing little downward ticks but its really been stable in my mind those small million million decreases have been relatively stable as you said and weve seen historically the fourth quarter is the best quarter right as companies try to do some window dressing so i dont know that i can confidently say that were at the bottom but i certainly feel a whole lot better today than i did a quarter ago steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then on the loan side i think ive been able to piece together all the color you gave on consumer and commercial but theres no doubt loan growth picked up this quarter could you give us drill down why is it just these new markets coming online when you look at the growth and it sounds like youre pretty optimistic you think its sustainable this improvement youre seeing phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc no steven with all of that its still i think highsingle digits number and thats kind of what our sustainable target has been for a while so i would hope that it is it would be our goal that it is weve looked hard at where its coming from like i said with that really big spike in the second quarter we talked about where it came from and it was by and large a lot of good credits it just didnt meet our structure that what we wanted to do maybe maybe we were full in a category and didnt want to reach out in one particular area and i think in just talking to our people a lot of banks they just put their pencils down and we have liquidity people know that were not always the place where people like to go to get a little structure on a deal but were consistent through the good times and bad times i think people realize that and i think that we got a lot of phone calls and a lot of opportunities to do stuff and i mentioned how many we declined because i didnt want people thinking that oh well look cullenfrost got some loan growth they must be just taken other peoples problems thats not whats happening and were just seeing a lot of good opportunity i think part of it is well its a lot of things its our reputation for strength and stability in times like these but yeah our people are great at sales and calling and developing relationships theyre held accountable to it theyve been doing a good job when you have a balance sheet like ours it puts you in a good place to take advantage of opportunities and i think thats what weve been seeing its hard to pin down on any one particular thing because i think its been pretty consistent i might speak a little bit more about it because i just had a recent conversation about the expansion growth right i gave you try to give you some feel for its pretty granular in terms of whats coming on but i had a conversation but what kind of deals are we seeing and a lot of it is its owner its owner businesses right they have a business a business to consumer model theyre not really sexy businesses but in a sense but theyre just good stable longterm businesses that are a result of hiring community bankers in these communities weve gone in and its so it is very diverse the commercial real estate that we see there is mainly because someone wants to not pay rent anymore they want to own their own building for their business thats slowed down some because rates are so high but thats cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 still going to be the arc i think of the kind of business were doing and when i hear that it makes me feel really good about just how our core and how stable it is because thats really our wheelhouse steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah phil so if i could ask one final one so as were probably i dont know twothirds through earnings season what were hearing from the industry particularly the larger regionals because most of them are on this rwa indiscernible right theyre just shrinking assets theyre almost all tightening on expenses right a lot of them are guiding to flattish expenses for and to be quite frank i dont know how to think about cullenfrost for and im not looking for like a number but i want to know how youre thinking about it because in many ways this is going to be a great market for you to take bankers right i mean as everybody is sort of on the sidelines which you mentioned so i dont know i think number is yearoveryear are you thinking about hey this is a year that were going to continue to expand and maybe expense growth stays at that rate or are you share some of your other ceos like no we need to tighten also just because the environments a little more challenging how do you think about that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc well what were thinking is that weve got a great opportunity to expand and we have plans in place were doubling we started the process of doubling austin in the middle of tripling dallas we think these are great opportunities and we are getting good applicant flow let me put it that way in these markets so its not like were going oh we need to hire more bankers because weve got an opportunity for this or that i mean were hiring tons of bankers as a part of this expansion and theres plenty of work to go around there so we are hiring but its a part of our strategy weve put in place already were having good success there we are not backing off and saying oh look we need to cut expenses now because i dont know because for whatever were winning competitively ill just say and nows the time for us to keep moving forward now did jerry and i talk with folks about what theyre spending and what the trend is we want it to be lower next year just because theres a limit to what you can do over time and we want to be prudent about all this stuff no we are not in a retrenchment mode at all jerry you want to talk something about expenses jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i mean i think phil said it and weve been very focused as you said and steven you know us our focus on expenses continues certainly when you look at the percentage you might someone may roll their eyes but obviously we talked about the things that were doing to grow the business grow our product selection and expand our marketing i actually think those have all been it improved our technology those have all been smart things that were doing and as we said our guidance for our team has really been that we are weve kind of given guidance to this mid teen sort of growth this year but certainly would expect that when we talk in january that thats not the sort of growth well be giving from a target standpoint steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 okay thanks for all the color phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator our next question is from dave rochester with compass point please proceed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys nice quarter phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on your outlook for higher eps versus consensus are you guys assuming youve reached a bottom now in nim and nii given your rate outlook youve been pretty stable here for a couple of quarters now are you thinking that trend continues and then when do you think you could get back to nii growth jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think that and i think ive been pretty consistent the fourth quarter for us i think is going to be a little bit weaker i dont think its and its not significant the guidance i gave last quarter was i thought theyd be flattish and i could even still say that with a downward bias i mean we were down basis point between these quarters so im kind of feeling that same pressure i think that as i look out into and well give more color in january as i said but i think weve talked a couple of times that we have some opportunities with some reinvestment of some proceeds that are going to be coming to us pretty early in from maturities in our investment portfolio and even though we havent really decided what sort of an investment plan well put in place just putting it on our in balances at the fed would be a significant improvement i think weve made no secret of the fact that we bought billion in treasury securities that mature i think the first tranche say first million is on december 31st so i really say basically theyre all in early and its at a so thats sort of a pickup that were kind of projecting for most of as those securities get to be reinvested and a lot of it will be dependent of what our assumptions are for lower rates if thats the case in when we cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 get to that forecasting period in january but right now i do think that we the same guidance i gave last quarter about kind of flattish to a little bit downward bias is kind of where im at for this fourth quarter david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay appreciate that and then going back to the stats you were talking about on the noninterestbearing it sounded like october was down if i heard this right maybe millionish from the september average i know that will bounce around was just wondering if you had isolated what drove that tick up in the runoff here this month jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no to be honest with you theres so many accounts in there and theres a lot of positives and negatives and a lot of volatility that goes in with those accounts and to be honest with you from my end when i see a movement like that in a month i tend to think its pretty flattish and we hope certainly that weve seen the drop to bottom as we said phil talked about the new relationships that were adding on the commercial side it typically takes us a few months from three months to six months to get those commercial deposits on so we continue to be pretty optimistic about it and hope the worst is behind us david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and maybe one last one just on expenses you mentioned the midteens growth guide and that implies a little bit of a wider range i guess since we only have one quarter left and it seems like a midpoint would imply a little bit of a step up in expense growth in are you thinking maybe more at the bottom end of that range at this point since you came in a little bit lower this quarter jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i was joking a little bit earlier today phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc indiscernible jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i was joking a little bit earlier of what does midteens mean right in my mind thats one number and it could be a different number in your case i will say david that my expectation today versus where we were a quarter ago is that well be lower we had a really we beat for the quarter and some of it was on the expense side coming in lower than we had expected and we do a lot of settlements on incentives and kind of look and see where all those incentive plans come in some of our incentive payments all vest and are issued and vest in the fourth quarter so theres a little bit uncertainty there but if youre looking at where i was a quarter ago versus where i am today yeah i certainly feel like it will be a little bit lighter than i thought we would be cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah when i saw the growth at the slower rate this quarter versus what we expected i figured that that was going to be a response jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc appreciate it thank you guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey so phil you talked about growth maybe somewhat slowing as we look into next year but just give us a sense of how customers are holding up when we think about this lagged effect of the fed rate hikes maybe consumer demand slowing down a bit im not sure whether or not thats happening in your markets but give us a sense of just the resiliency of the customer base where if any place where youre seeing softness from a credit quality perspective and it may not be within frosts loan book but just in the market where youre seeing some softness phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc ebrahim i think the you know theyre pretty well known right its deals that were underwritten that have seen them on a floating basis that have seen the higher rates and operating cost are up there are honestly i mean i dont pay a lot of attention to other banks but i mean i know our credit is credit numbers are really strong i dont get the sense weve had a tremendous problem here in the state and we said were glad were operating in texas we really are i think it makes a huge difference cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 i dont see things you mentioned i said it was slower next year i dont remember that i dont feel like its going to be that much slower i talked to customers its kind of funny when you go out and talk to them i was with a construction guy and he looked at me said im really interested in how you see the economy and i said well i was embarrassed saying it i said i dont think its that bad and he looked at me said thats how id think too and we almost felt embarrassed for each other that we said if we feel like were going to get canceled or something because theres i guess if you watch too much tv you think its supposed to be bad but i think its more worry about than there is actual problems today and im not trying to be pollyanna its just most people when you talk about their business theres some problems here or there we got talked about some increase in our risk grade i mean yes there are some issues but its not bad if i had to pick lets say okay let me see so i would say probably you know you buy here pay here used car its got some pressure because theyre rate sensitive business and so thats probably some issues i mean if youve got an office building thats refiing now and you dont have the capacity or the willingness to right size it there could be some issues there and then theres just the oneoff thing thats just business that we see weve seen some things and lets say contractors there was a big electrical contractor but they had government work which is always a little bit dicey from our experience but theyre working hard to right that shift but you know if you didnt bid the right way and cost went up you got a fixed rate deal fixed cost deal that could be some issues so those are the kind of things were seeing but like we said on our prepared comments its youre holding in there and and look ill say lets take multifamily they were underwritten years ago years ago its in construction theyre going to have to if rates dont go down they have to right size some of the stuff but they know that and weve been talking to them about that and it matters who youre doing business with and who your sponsors are and so its not something that were really worried about and at this point and i think most of that stuff matures or has to be dealt with in and theres very little of it i think in yeah and ill give you one other thing that because maybe think im whistling past the graveyard there was a multifamily deal indiscernible a customer it was right at one times coverage okay and that thing sold at a cap and a gain to the borrower so just because i mean indiscernible theres still a lot of demand for that out there and so even though you might not be making a debtservice coverage ratio somewhere that if youre in the right asset class theres still some demand for what youve got so i know i didnt answer that very specifically but i think things are still hanging in there pretty well right now and the final thing ill say is as it relates to the consumer they still got a job you know theyve in texas the unemployment numbers look pretty good and as long as theyve got a job even though maybe spending down their savings are able to hang in there spend money ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it that is good color thanks phil and apologies if i missed it but can you remind us in terms of new branch store openings over the next year like whats in the pipeline be it in austin or dallas phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc thats a good question im going to try to guess a little bit here but im going to guess 15ish or so locations cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think some of its going to be dependent were having some conversations early this week especially when you talk about a market like austin where weve got a the permitting process is different were different were having to deal with different municipal parties and such so that can kind of affect certainly the number that were talking about but i think the last number i saw combined in was around i think across all three markets phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i think it makes sense ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc but at combined and how would that compare jerry to what we did this year in jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think its it would be right now a little bit lower than where we were in ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood right thank you for taking my questions jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator our next question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon i wanted to check in on deposit data as you spoke about seeing a mix shift from lower cost to higher cost deposits again this quarter can you help us think through peak deposit betas in as rates stay higher for longer just given and also give some color on the competition that youre seeing jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah so right now for i guess ill talk a little bit about so for the third quarter i think cumulatively on this cycle were up we were at on interestbearing we were at in the second quarter were at at the end of the third quarter id expect that same sort of a little clip between the third and the fourth quarter on interestbearing and same sort of movement on total deposits i think we increased from to through the end of the third quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 right now from a competitive standpoint were really we try to keep an eye and we do keep an eye on our competitors really at all levels we dont feel like we need to be the top but we do want to be competitive and we look at rates weekly what weve seen more competitive pressure today in the last couple of recent weeks has been more on the cde side i think thats really what large consumers and commercial customers are looking for is kind of what the cd rates are to keep it at the bank and so thats where were seeing most of the pressure and we tend to price we keep an eye on what the comparable treasury security is doing to determine our pricing there so i think were really pretty competitive and feel good about where were at manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and maybe a followup on expenses i know you noted the expense growth rate would likely come down next year but at the start of this year when you guided to the midteens expense growth i think you had mentioned youd be investing in some it and cyber projects upgrading a couple of core systems and i think you also noted that the timing of several large projects were just coinciding in so should we think about some of these onetime costs coming out next year or are these multiyear investments that youre making in the business phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think most of the things that were talking about are multiyear investments most of these are going to be either positions that we hired from new it staff or projects that will get capitalized i think what weve seen is that some of this has moved into later parts of a little bit and so feeling a little bit of some of the upside that we probably are seeing when we talked about earning expense guidance being a little bit lighter than where we originally thought had a little bit to do with some of that timing so were not really im not thinking anything that comes to mind immediately a onetime sort of expenses that were driving that expense growth this year it was more that more people and capitalized projects and like i said we have a little bit thats moving into next year but as phil said we dont expect certainly that that our expense growth for next year will be in the double digits that the midteens that ive been discussing for this year does that help manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc it doesnt sound like theres a large chunk of investments that are getting delayed and moving from this year to next year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think thatll be a good conclusion manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 operator our next question is from brady gailey with kbw please proceed brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe just to ask the expense question a little differently as i look over the last i dont know three or four years you made a big investment in houston a big investment in dallas now a big investment in austin i know that was a big piece of the abnormally high expense growth as you think about it going forward are there still markets out there where you want to make a substantial new investment or do you think with these three i mean youre kind of in the three big spots there in texas with these three are you kind of done making these large investments in a new market phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc brady i mean look weve got we got a lot of first of all we have a lot work left to do okay so we got to finish up dallas we were just starting austin and weve got a pretty big network that were going to continue to deal with and continue to grow in the normal course of business right but i dont want to be too far out in front of that but look were going to be like i said earlier were going to be doing this for a long time i mean there are great markets to be in in the state theyre great markets to be in out of this state im looking way down the road i mean im just saying i dont think theres anything about our business model that ends when we get through doing branches in austin and so maybe to answer your question another way the way to think about our company is probably that weve got this legacy part of our company that operates very efficiently and very profitably and its got a lot of control in terms of expenses that kind of thing and then we have this expansion element of our company that is a growth and expansion component and that has higher growth rates just its the nature of that kind of business and what we believe is the combination of those two and they do two different things right theres a legacy kind of piece and theres this new expansion piece maybe well probably always be as long as were doing a little bit higher on average than others but another way to think of it too is a lot of these expansion assets are going to be creating the money and the revenue to fund future expansions too so thats not a very specific answer but its sort of how we think about the business right now brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 yeah that helps and then weve seen some of your peers do a partial bond restructuring i know your bond yield was around so if you mark to market that bond yield youll probably be picking up at least a couple of hundred basis points how do you all think about restructuring a piece of the bond book and your tce is in the mid range like does that matter i know common equity tier is a lot higher but does the tce matter when you consider a possible bond restructuring jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady ill say that we have not discussed any sort of a bond restructuring i think that weve got obviously weve got the securities and available for sale we think it gives us the most amount of flexibility we like the transparency that it provides through equity and i think from a tangible capital standpoint we dont spend a lot of time thinking about it were obviously aware of it as we said earlier we havent made any investment purchases this year i think if we do put a program in place well certainly whatever program we put in place we will certainly consider the potential implications of the new capital regime thats out there for banks that are billion that would have to include oci so were not its nothing that were not aware of its more that at this point its not been really something that thats been part of our conversation so anyway anything else i would say id kind of make it up but its not something that weve really talked about going forward brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally for me it looks like it looks like the share count went down just modestly in the third quarter relative to the second quarter so maybe a modest amount of share buybacks your stock was at a year to date low i know its up pretty nicely today but its still relatively cheap versus where you all have been trading earlier this year how do you think about a share buyback with the stock at this level jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think we spent we didnt spend a lot of money but we got in earlier than i would have liked in retrospect i think i dont have the numbers right in front of me but i think it was around million that we spent in the quarter i mean its just something that well talk about there is on one side were having the conversation like you said about how much are people paying attention to tangible capital and on the other side im talking about what a great bargain our stock is even before today before today especially so its just a conversation well continue to have it wont have big implications i think at this point were probably weve got a 100million program that expires in january weve probably utilized million of it if i remember correctly so it wont have huge impacts but its something that we consider continue to discuss but again its not going to have a big impact brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks for the color guys operator our next question is from michael rose with raymond james please proceed cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon thanks for taking my questions phil i noticed your comments about optimism around home equity and just looking at the average balances we dont have them for this quarter to indiscernible that out but just over the past quarter couple of quarters it seems like thats over half the average loan growth just wanted to kind of size the opportunity as we move forward and particularly as you roll out the mortgage product thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc im sorry michael did you asked me the outlook for that or what would you say i mean i agree with your numbers but what were you asking michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc just if you could size the opportunity as we move forward because you did sound fairly optimistic phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc oh i see michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc going forward and then as you layer in mortgage consumer mortgage i know the markets not great but youre in texas just trying to get a sense for what the growth opportunity is and i think that home equity consumer line is about of the portfolio just where do you think that could get to over time thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well the mortgage portfolio has is a great asset class for us i think over time this is back a year ago when we started talking about it i think we said i cant remember exactly what we said but the impression we wanted to give you was that hey this could be mortgage itself over time could be what the consumer real estate portfolio was at that time just by itself and so thats we still think its good this is a longterm product longterm relationships so we feel good about it and remember were not doing a refi program so i dont care that the refi markets down in fact i love it because its allowed us to get i dont know what people or so that we were able to bring in great mortgage professionals to build that infrastructure over the last year so were all about putting people in homes and thats i think were going to have a chance to do that for a long time i think that i saw a number michael the percentage of people that had a what was it a mortgage was like over is amazing and if you looked at the people that had under ph was it its like something percent of the mortgages so if you want a i mean people are not moving right and so i think that this home equity product has got legs its home improvement products its got legs for a while the rate of growth has been so high what mid20 sometimes that i think that just by its nature the law of numbers it has to go down in terms of percentage cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 but i still think the volume should be pretty good because it just fills a gap that people need right now michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great i appreciate the color and just one final for me so the i guess the potential problem loans were up about qonq any notable trends in there anything to read in that or its just more kind of normalization of credit off of a very low base thanks phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc the numbers ive looked at were the i think where i saw the change was in the risk grade really there were about i think there were four credits that made up the vast majority of that and they were like different businesses there are a couple of real estate properties they were actually they were smaller office buildings they had kind of idiosyncratic things and we dont feel that bad about them but we felt they remember this is oaem this is a lighter classification but and then there was something a midstream energy trading company that its just a business kind of thing i mean indiscernible i think and then we got what was the other one oh i think it was a i think it was a fiveyear eightyear outfit i think thats what that was and so it kind of an interest sensitive business weve seen some of that that was the kind of thing it didnt give me lot of heartburn its just reflective of the environment were in but i didnt think it said anything in particular about how are we doing were doing things in fact i think it shows that we were doing our business pretty well and again ive said since the beginning of this that its a risk business and will we see some hiccups here or there of course we will but i feel really good about how weve done things i feel really good about the customers not every one of them has performed like we want but most of them have i feel pretty comfortable with it michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great i appreciate the color thanks for operator and our final question is from brody preston with ubs please proceed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hello everyone phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc hello jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i was just wondering i wanted to followup on office i was wondering if you happen to have what the reserve against the office portfolio is and how you think about that moving forward just given some of the larger banks are putting up pretty hefty reserves against their office portfolios phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc lets see what we have here jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah im looking at what ive got ive only got the commercial real estate as a group what im looking at brody i dont have the office but certainly i think that number if im looking at this correctly here is on all commercial real estate and certainly if you get with ab we could certainly provide you that detail i dont think ive got it here in front of me brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great ill follow up phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer director cullenfrost bankers inc i will say im not going to do anything just because the large banks are doing something just so you know brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it i did also jerry im sorry to go back to expenses and jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure hey brody so im getting a chat real quick its saying that our reserve is on office brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you very much for that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i did just want to touch on expenses cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc the a couple of quarters ago you said you thought that the longterm kind of expense growth rate for the bank is highsingledigit i just want to ask like would it be fair to say that austin the austin buildout will be mildly additive to that kind of longterm growth rate when you think about planning for next year jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that the way we tend to look at it is and again its going to be dependent on how big an expansion we really typically would originate but when i gave that sort of guidance that was inclusive would be inclusive of what we were doing brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thats helpful and then the last one that i had was im sorry if you said it earlier and i missed it do you happen to have for the fixed rate portion of loan portfolio whats coming due over the next months and what the yield pickup on that would be jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i dont think ive got that handy with me brody but again i think thats something certainly ab can get it to you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay maybe if i could just ask one more jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure of course brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc do you happen to have what the percent of the portfolio that sncs is jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think its let me double check that but thats my recollection hold on just a second yeah at the end of at the end of september that portfolio was the snc portfolio was million or of the periodend loans cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call
