statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our sec filings including without limitation the risk factors section of our form 10k citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 with that said let me turn it over to mike michael verdeschi treasurer citigroup inc thank you tom and good morning everyone on todays call i will cover a number of topics first ill briefly discuss our yeartodate operating results second i will cover recent balance sheet trends third ill review our issuance program and finally ill discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position slide summarizes our results from the third quarter and yeartodate yeartodate we reported net income of just over billion which included a billion increase in credit reserves under the cecl framework on slide we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars on this basis we have grown our balance sheet by approximately over the last year as we continue to support our consumer and institutional clients as they managed through the covid19 health crisis while also maintaining a strong balance sheet we continue to see strong growth in deposits across both gcb and icg loans declined primarily driven by a modest decline in gcb as a result of lower consumer spending tradingrelated assets and liabilities grew reflecting the continuation of heightened client activity relative to the prior year and longterm debt increased as we built liquidity to support our clients and maintained the firms robust liquidity profile slide presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars total citigroup loans decreased yearoveryear in our consumer franchise average loans declined yearoveryear reflecting the impact of lower consumer spending in our cards business higher payments by customers given fiscal stimulus and a continuation of the pause in proactive marketing in our institutional franchise average loans grew yearoveryear average loans in corporate lending grew yearoveryear but were down sequentially reflecting significant repayments as we assisted our clients in accessing the capital markets private bank loans increased largely driven by residential real estate lending to our highnet worth clients tts loans decreased reflecting softness in underlying trade flows and the continued low level of spend in commercial cards and loans included in corpother continued to decline driven by the winddown of legacy assets on slide we show credit quality trends in our gcb and icg loan portfolios in icg credit quality remained broadly stable in the third quarter nonaccrual loans declined by roughly million sequentially to billion or basis points of total loans reflecting writeoffs and repayments across the portfolio in gcb credit trends remained broadly stable to improving this quarter given high levels of liquidity in the us lower spending and the benefits of relief programs however we do expect losses to begin to rise next year as government stimulus and other programs roll off and unemployment remains elevated at an aggregate level we are likely to see losses peak towards the end of with losses in asia and mexico peaking a little earlier than the us that said we believe we are wellprepared for expected credit losses across both our consumer and institutional portfolios as of the third quarter we held credit reserves of billion of citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 this amount billion represents our management adjustment for economic uncertainty which factors in a downside scenario that is more adverse than our base case as we noted on our earnings call earlier this month given the lifetime nature of the cecl methodology and the conservative nature of our management adjustment it is now more likely than not that well see reserve releases and our acl come down in to offset future losses and as we continue to progress through the crisis assuming our base case holds turning to slide we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars total average deposits increased from the prioryear period reflecting continued client engagement as well as the elevated level of liquidity in the system now let me cover our current benchmark debt issuance program on slide so far this year we have issued approximately billion of current level benchmark debt across a variety of tenors including the inaugural billion affordable housing bond we priced last week going forward well continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors currencies and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and support our clients on slide let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectations as i just mentioned we have issued approximately billion yeartodate and we expect our total issuance to be around this level however we will remain opportunistic given the uncertain environment and we will continue to be flexible around optimizing our funding through opportunistic redemptions on slide we show the composition of our longterm debt outstanding during the third quarter our total long term debt declined by approximately billion to billion as we allowed our bank debt to mature given strong deposit growth on slide we provide an update of our lcr metrics and drivers our average lcr increased modestly to this year turning to slide let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics our cet1 capital ratio increased to primarily driven by net income and our slrs were and for citigroup and citibank respectively moving to our last slide let me summarize several key points yeartodate we have performed well and demonstrated the significant earnings power of the franchise we earned roughly billion of net income yearto date despite a billion increase in credit reserves we maintain a strong capital position with a cet1 capital ratio of close to basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement an slr of and a surplus above our tlac requirement and we also maintain a strong liquidity position with an average lcr of over billion of available liquidity resources and we expect to be in compliance with the nsfr when the rule is effective our capital and liquidity profile remains strong and wellpositioned to withstand potential pressure if economic conditions deteriorate and we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in ways that deepen and expand our client relationships and support the broader recovery before we move onto qa let me touch briefly on libor we are continuing to prepare for the transition away from libor by the end of by working with our regulators and various industryworking groups as well as through the work streams weve established within citi citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 since the second quarter we have transitioned the discounting of centrally cleared euro and us dollar interest rate derivatives to the euro shortterm rate and the secured overnight financing rate respectively announced the adoption of newly published isda protocol for existing ibor derivatives transactions and increased our virtual client communication efforts including outreach regarding these new industryled protocols and solutions with regard to the subset of our preferreds which we have mentioned on previous calls while we are continuing to evaluate alternatives we dont have any further updates at this time and with that mark and i will be happy to answer your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of scott cavanagh of apg scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc good morning guys thanks for the call as always mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc good morning scott scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc yeah hi guys i just wanted to applaud your efforts on the affordable housing bond we view that as a great step in the right direction there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc so moving away from the notable consent order issue just sorry i dont know what mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc were getting a lot of feedback here citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc yeah i can hear mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc there we go okay thats better scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc so when we talked about the last topic you brought up the libor transition could you talk about your efforts to do to transition both on the asset and liability perspective and then when you think about the outreach to your holders whether its the preferreds or unsecureds how are you thinking about that addressing potential language whether its consent fees exchanges how are you thinking about addressing that michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc so scott its mike a couple of thoughts on the preferreds so as weve talked about in the past theres a number of things that were evaluating we talked about a couple of options including an amendment or even an exchange but at the same time were working with the industry on broadbased solutions so we think its important to have that evaluation being done in parallel so for the benefit of everyone not jumping ahead with some transaction or some amendment makes sense to us given the broader industry efforts were wellaware of the transition timeline and our view on these securities are unchanged that we have a desire to address them more broadly in the transition where we look at the assets and liabilities obviously theres a number of work streams and efforts underway that includes looking at derivatives weve talked about the isda protocols so that is a significant effort and something that is an important step forward in dealing with the transition in the derivatives book and then of course when we look at the broader portfolios were thinking about that transition away from libor weve talked a lot about the replacement rate of sofr and how that operates as more of a riskfree rate and so were having to be thoughtful about the pricing of those loans both internally and how we think about that for our clients so a lot of the work is around again that client outreach things around the operational capabilities things around the pricing of that activity so a lot of that work continues around those efforts broadbased transition planning but again there will be some important steps along the way that were taking with those industrywide efforts scott cavanagh q analyst apg asset management us inc okay and then a followup question talking about regulation as we had the final rule for the tlac holdings how should we be thinking about this as far as how meaningful it is for not only a tier deduction but rather from when you think about your trading desk and the risk allocation and the disincentive to hold gsibs bonds and the potential for more volatility of these bonds because of this rule could you kind of give us a scope of what is historical levels in regards to this new minimums and is this something that will be meaningful citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure so generally speaking as we look at this final rule its substantially consistent with the proposal and we believe the rule does allow for sufficient flexibility and marketmaking activities and thats both in bau and even during heightened stress periods where you may be carrying a higher level of inventory so if you look at the past year that exception for marketmaking activities was still sufficient so when we look at our tier obviously were carrying substantially above where our target is weve talked about a target of roughly basis points and at this point our tier is closer to basis points in terms of the monitoring of course were always going be closely evaluating the balance sheet the use of resources of the balance sheet in the different businesses and the different activities and really this would be no different of course were going have a lens on this activity and understanding the use of resources so our read is that we think that exception for marketmaking is actually quite sufficient operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of brian monteleone with barclays brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning brian monteleone q analyst barclays capital inc regarding the consent order can you talk a little more granularly about the gap analysis the kind of scope of activities that are being analyzed what areas do you think are most pressing and can you give some color on i guess how you think this is going to make citi a safer bank mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so i mentioned a couple things so one we obviously got three consent orders so one was the civil money penalty the million and the other two were largely aligned and focused on our risk infrastructure and controls and there were a number of areas that were highlighted in both one was enterprise risk data controls compliance et cetera and as you pointed out the consent order referenced the need to develop endstate plans identify where we are today and close the gap identify the gap and close the gap weve been clear that on a couple of things one that weve got a sense of urgency to get after this two i think ive been clear that i consider this an investment an investment in risk infrastructure and controls and three as an investment i would expect improvement in our processes enhanced technology and digital capabilities automated controls straightthrough processing et cetera and as a result greater efficiency in the way we do business and in our ability to leverage our data and deliver products and services that are more innovative and in a faster way to our clients citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 and so i highlight that to say this is an investment that we are making in our platforms and in our operations to be a little bit more specific there are operations that we still have today that have manual processes and steps that are part of them whether it be loan origination and processing where we have people who are responsible for checks and balances and controls throughout that process as were trying to move towards more updated and more automated platforms as we make these investments in things like those loan operations we will be able to reduce and eliminate manual steps and replace that with an improved technology and process andor improved data coming into our systems so that you need fewer people to actually reconcile and provide the checks and balances along the way thats going make the process more efficient thats going to ensure that we have more accurate information without having those manual steps to get there and thats going to allow for us to get a better product faster on the other side of this and so investment is required obviously we have a sense of urgency to get after those investments not only because of the consent order but because of what they mean and our ability to do business and serve our clients and win brian q monteleone analyst barclays capital inc thanks for that mark then maybe a followup question for mike on slide you have the surplus tlac and longterm debt which i believe is including the temporary benefit around the leverage exposure do you have what that surplus would be without that temporary benefit and as you think about managing your outstanding tlac over the next six months are you managing it to this buffer as reported and assuming that the temporary release gets extended or are you managing it more towards an exrelease basis thanks michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure certainly managing the funding profile and the tlac assuming that that exception goes away at some point and it is set to expire at the end of the first quarter so yes as you look at our tlac and the longterm debt as a percentage of leverage that gives us a billion tlac cushion today if you take out or as you let that exception expire it basically takes away roughly billion so it brings down your tlac to call it billion all else equal at that time in the past weve talked about a targeted range of billion to billion so at billion its still double the targeted range that were comfortable running at and that actually doesnt include the issuance that we had just done last week so but we are definitely managing the profile with the longterm view as if that expires operator your next question is from the line of robert smalley with ubs robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning mark mike and tom thanks for doing the call mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure good morning robert robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc a couple of questions first one on commercial real estate could you talk about your exposures there as we see concerns about the impact of the pandemic on the sector with respect to construction mortgages and debt and also any other kind of secondary exposure you might have to businesses or families who derive most of their income from real estate thats my first one second one just a data point could you give us your var number for the quarter its usually a q number but i didnt i havent seen it reported yet and then third on preferreds i think you left a preferred outstanding to float the its got libor reset could you talk about why you elected to do that were seeing some other of your peers issue fixedforlife securities and the market at ph is something that youre okay with paying whats the kind of mendoza line there on the back end mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc great well theres a lot there why dont i take the first two and then mike ill let you chime in on the third one so first look let me start by just kind of reiterating something that ive stated before which is remember our strategy is to focus on large multinational clients they tend to be highinvestment grade in terms of that focus weve been very disciplined about that weve got a disciplined risk framework and we manage very tightly to our risk appetite with that said weve got a long history in many of these sectors many of the sectors that we talk about is high risk industries today we have a long history in them we have a long history with the clients that we serve in those specific areas now with commercial real estate specifically as of the end of the quarter our total credit exposure corporate credit exposure to cre was about billion about billion of that was funded and that would represent about of our outstanding loans we also additionally we had approximately of that exposure as of the quarterend was to borrowers in the us and of that was investment grade when we looked deeper into the cre portfolio about of the exposure relates to exposures that are secured by mortgages or underlying properties or in wellrated securitization exposures and a little bit more than half of that is in community reinvestment actrelated lending about relates to unsecured loans to large reits and about of the exposure there is rated investment grade and a little less than relates to our cre exposure in the private bank getting to part of your question of which of that is secured by mortgages or underlying properties and about of that was rated investment grade again at the end of this quarter final point i guess id make is that as you know and as weve mentioned before we feel as though we are well reserved as a firm and as i look at the allowance for credit losses for the cre portfolio theyre about of funded loans and about on the funded noninvestment grade loans so again if you think about our total icg citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 business it has a fundedtoloan ratio of you see that in our presentation a higher percentage tied to this cre portfolio on your question related to var our average var decreased in the quarter by about million and its down to about million million or so at the end of the quarter and that decrease is largely due to the market volatility coming down as well as the normalization of credit spreads mike do you want to take the last question there michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure so in terms of the preferreds as weve talked about before as these securities become callable well evaluate one the need for that capital to remain outstanding and then the second how do we think about the economics if we do need that capital of calling that structure and reissuing versus leaving it outstanding and so and keep in mind these structures this one in particular is callable quarterly so we will continue to evaluate this structure and all the structures that are callable around whether it makes sense to leave outstanding or call and reissue and i think that series that you picked out in particular is pretty close for consideration but well continue to evaluate all the structures as we normally do robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc are there any considerations that from the outside we may not be seeing that go into your calculation as to calling or not calling or anything that youre weighting more that we may not be considering michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc no i dont think so i mean of course when we do these well look at the price well include fees in our thinking and other factors weve talked about the transition away from libor and the language so thats another factor we think about but i dont think youre all missing anything operator your next question is from the line of arnold kakuda with the bloomberg intelligent sic intelligence arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg intelligence hi mark mike and tom thanks for the call good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 arnold shoichi kakuda q analyst bloomberg intelligence so good morning you and your peers largely kept the allowance for loan losses flat in after a big ph billion increase and i hear you on the if the base case holds the reserves might go down but over the past few weeks weve seen us covid cases rise and so my question is it might be too early to talk about a change in your potential economic assumptions versus september but are the future reserves builds or releases are they more dependent on the outlook for the longerterm outlook or maybe even than kind of the nearterm mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look the again weve got about billion in reserves and if you look through what we did in the third quarter we had a slight build but the significant portion of that was tied to our downside scenario and so when we looked at kind of the base scenario given the volumes we saw in our consumer business we actually saw some improvement in the reserve levels and it was in fact the assumptions that we made around our downside scenario that drove an increase the million increase in our management adjustment which went up to about billion i highlight that to say as we look at the variables that go into our models it was in fact our estimates for a downside worse unemployment slower recovery in the way of gdp a situation where there was no vaccine in the developed market equities declined meaningfully so a pretty significant downside scenario we probability weight that and that was the more meaningful driver in the reserve the slight reserve build and the increase in the management adjustment id say to the other part of your question theres still a fair amount of uncertainty that remains just kind of given the rise in cases that were seeing given the election thats out there given brexit given the lack of clarity around stimulus but that said we feel good about the reserve levels we have we feel good about the downside scenario thats been factored in and the probability associated with that and well just have to see how things kind of play out its too soon to suggest otherwise arnold shoichi q kakuda analyst bloomberg intelligence okay got it thank you and then switching gears citigroup you performed your june stress test results were better than peers your cet1 declined less than peers right and i think thats a great achievement its really a testament to all the hard work that you had put in to the transformation of citigroup since the financial crisis however since then youve announced a ceo change and then followed by the consent orders so how should we think about the upcoming stress test results kind of in light of some of the recent changes that weve seen at citigroup mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc well yeah i think i would separate the two and so youre right we have had i think very strong performance coming straight through and we have continued to perform well through this crisis an unprecedented crisis and continued to maintain capital strength and liquidity and serve our clients citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 we are having a transition of our ceo after a long tenure here mike has announced his retirement and jane will take over in february and i think that will create an opportunity for us to continue i think a path of continued strong performance under janes leadership and were very much looking forward to that with mike having brought us to a very very good point i would say in the way of our strategy and our financial performance were in a crisis and so the regulators have decided to request a resubmission from the industry and we like others have spent the past almost days working on that resubmission crafting our own scenario of what this stress could look like and comparing that to the three scenarios provided by the fed and well make that submission in i think in december theyve talked about perhaps sharing the output from that but they havent spoken to how they would intend to use that and so we dont have any additional clarity as to how the results of that would be used but the final point id make is that weve built a resubmission that reflects the environment that were in and our best sense for what we would need to continue to invest in our franchise to ensure strong performance going forward and we go into this next submission with an scb from the last one that was and that was floored so our underlying scb was something closer to including the dividend so i think we go into it from a position of relative strength given the environment operator your next question is from the line of hima inguva with bank of america hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning mark mike mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc thanks for doing the call and im sorry i had an issue with the line so and scott asked my question on tlac holdings so thats great im going to switch up a bit and if you dont mind im going ask you about the election that we have coming up and market seems to be thinking a biden presidency with a democratic senate im not asking you to opine on the outcome of the election im more interested in knowing your thoughts around the implications of one way or the other if you think we could have a more stricter regulatory regime going forward if it were to be a biden presidency or if it is status quo do you expect anything i guess to move forward in the senate and then to that if you see a split congress or if any other color that you can provide in terms of the detail of how the senate may shape up again not the outcome how regulation may shape up depending on how the turnout maybe i would really appreciate it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah hima as you can imagine i mean im not going to comment kind of on the politics and the potential outcomes of an administration change i think that would be difficult to do at this stage and theres so many factors involved in that i think there are a couple of things that remain true almost regardless of how it plays out citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 and one is its an obvious one i think but we need a resolution to this health crisis that were managing through and we need a vaccine thats put in place one that works and one that can be broadly distributed we need a stimulus program to help bridge consumers through this and in order to kind of starve off some of the unemployment increased unemployment that were seeing and slower growth of gdp we certainly we potentially could see tax implications from it but that is an uncertainty and if that plays out with the biden administration i talked on the earnings call as to what the implications of that would be i think we like many other corporations will have to kind of take a look at what this crisis means for our going forward right so we are working with clients on a regular basis as they think about their supply chains and things of that sort as they think about their real estate footprint and things of that sort and we too will think about things like our real estate footprint or the future of work for example and so theres a fair amount of uncertainty thats out there i cant speak specifically to the implications of the political outcome what i can say is that our focus on many of the things youve heard us talk to before whether its investing in this franchise or execution against our strategy or improving profits or improving our return on and return of capital will still be there and well still have a sense of urgency for continuing down that path hima b inguva q analyst bofa securities inc okay great thank you and if i could if i may ask a followup on that on the real estate footprint or maybe more importantly about future of workplace do you envision a scenario where you see your employees primarily working remotely or maybe doing a hybrid work setup can you share any thinking around that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look im of the belief that theres always going to be its important to have some population kind of in the office if for no other reason training and thats how a lot of knowledge gets transferred through and to our employees and so i dont i certainly dont envision a world where everyone is working remote at our firm i do think that we are still learning from this remote working pilot if you will its a pretty extensive pilot but were still learning from that and i do think it will inform different parts of the organization and different parts of the operations as to what will work in the office and what can work remotely but its still soon to tell at this point were still at a little bit north of of our population globally working remotely and so its still and by the way its working right were still doing business we still had i think a very good quarter in the third quarter despite a significant part of our population having to work remotely and were still covering our clients effectively and so theres still learning there hima i dont have an end strategy to point to yet but it is something that we continue to analyze and assess operator your next question is from the line of ph nikhil khosla with jpmorgan q hey good morning and thanks for doing the call as always ill take another stab at the libor transition and preferreds and i appreciate your prior comments on this subject just thinking about the transition away and preferreds with libor back ends when you say the consent or exchange of whatever shape or form that move away from libor ph takes to the preferred are you contemplating a possible move to a cmt plus citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 ph hecm back end in that consent or exchange or is it only going to be into a sofr plus credit spread plus the back end kind of a structure michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc sure thanks for the question and as we look at these structures were of course going to take the feedback of our investors and where theres demand and yes weve seen back end sofr weve used that part of that is certainly supporting the transition away from libor and into sofr that being said we know theres been structures out there using cmt and that demand has been good for cmt and so as we look at needs in the future that will certainly be a consideration q and for the outstanding ones which indiscernible back in the day which have libor back ends im just curious about as you think about this consent or exchange you plan to do to correct the libor language can you think about moving those bonds to exchanging them to a cmt structure versus sofr as well michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah so again anything that we would come to market with we would consider what are our options for doing a new transaction i think with the exchange we would have to if that was a scenario that we wanted to go ahead with we would have to think about what qualifies as an exchange of a like security so but i think as we do new issues or call bonds and come to the market cmt is something we would certainly consider given the interest in that structure and i think in exchange we would just have to evaluate whether that would be an appropriately like exchange q understood appreciate that and a second one on the business side on the cards side and weve seen a couple of pureplay card names one came out and guided to much higher number of delinquencies from people coming of forbearance and we had other name which kind of did not see that so just curious to see what youre seeing in the two parts of your card sic cards businesses as people come off forbearance how many are kind of rolling into that delinquent bucket and between delinquent buckets and has anything really changed in the last month or so since the stimulus seems to be on a back burner here thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure look its interesting we have continued to see good performance from our consumer card customers and weve seen that both in payment rates weve seen that weve started to see purchase sales improvement just in terms of theyre still down yearoveryear for certain but not down as much as they had been in the prior two quarters and as youve heard us say before a lot of this is a byproduct of the stimulus but also the discipline of the consumer in deciding to channel that liquidity towards continuing to pay their cards or card balances citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 in the us to answer your question more specifically weve seen about of those that were on a forbearance program rolloff program and of those about continue to make payments in our us card sic cards business in our mexico business when we look at customers there we see probably have rolled off by the end of the third quarter so and about of the cards customers have remained current after rolling off and about of the pil personal loan customers and payroll customers have remained current after theyve rolled off and so weve seen continued resiliency when you look at the delinquency rates that we show theyre relatively stable and as we mentioned we would expect were now kind of expecting losses to peak really closer towards the end of given the way the delinquency buckets have been trending operator your next question is from the line of gary kessler with goldman sachs gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking hi thanks thanks for taking the call and answering all these questions mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure good morning gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking good morning one more on libor particularly some were starting to see some issuers address whether its in europe or federal farm credit bank here with some exchanges and when you think about the regulatory piece or the legislative piece and theres been items written on things being held up in albany and youve got delaware involved here with preferreds i mean what is sort of like the optimal scenario is it you guys have been more upfront than most on at least willingness to discuss it so how should we think about what the optimal scenario is for the pursuit of the updated fallback language and were drawing towards the end of the year were going to be in crunch time as we cross into january so i think were all looking for clarification because this is obviously a big issue and as a money center bank member of our committee wed love to get more clarity from all of you but you guys have more of a willingness to speak so were sort of looking for you guys to be the market leader here so i mean what can you tell us maybe a little bit more extensively on that front michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc look and as ive been talking about the securities that weve been talking about addressing weve been looking at a parallel process meaning that working with the industry on broadbased solutions but also looking at what we could potentially do on our own i do think the more consistent that the industry tackles some of these items and think about prefs broadly i think the better off we are because you create that consistency and i think you as youve seen with arrc making suggestions i think the reason why theyve been effective is because you are bringing together the broad industry youre coming up with proposed solutions and youre rolling that out in a largely consistent fashion citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 i do think the industry is best served with that consistent approach and i think again its a complex transition away from libor given the scope of it given the amount of products it impacts obviously when you think about derivatives theres protocol focus therefore that is meant to create some consistency of course on the loan side theres repapering efforts and so where you can get consistency there with fallback language so my view is that creating consistency bringing the industry together to help try to recommend and solve some of these topics is how the industry is best served gary david kessler q analyst goldman sachs co llc private banking just from a timing perspective i mean its obviously very complicated so when is it too late i mean when as investors do we need to start worrying that were not getting there fast enough and what can we do to be partners in this michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc yeah its a good question of course the focus that weve had that the industry has had is preparing to transition away from libor by the end of so i think thats a good way to think about it so i would say thats where our focus has been more broadly as you think about this transition away theres market liquidity that has to develop and this again is away from prefs but market liquidity developing with the recent move away from libor to sofr discounting as an example hopefully brings more liquidity into the system more participation in those rates and of course the transition is a function of the banks capabilities but also the investors and the clients we serve so its very broadbased it really needs that broad sponsorship to transition away successfully as an industry so theres a lot here and i think just everybody doing their part and working towards that transition will serve everyone best operator your final question is from the line of jesse rosenthal with creditsights jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc good morning guys mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc morning jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc a quick followup question on the topic du jour libor and the preferreds im kind of getting at the question a different way as mentioned that you do have this proposed legislation at the new york state level i think its also circulating at the federal level so just wanted to kind of get your view on the possibility or the feasibility even of a legislative fix here and then if theres anything that we should be monitoring on that legislative outcome michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q3 earnings call fixed income 28oct2020 look i realize theres a lot of appropriate questions around this and its hard to put a probability on whether that happens at new york or some other level i am encouraged by the dialogue occurring and looking at that broad based solution i do think its sensible to look at this holistically but its very hard to put a probability on how that gets solved and whether the legislative solution will go through and at what level that gets done so sorry i wish there was more that we can say with degree of certainty but again as i said before broadbased solutions is the best and its good to see this dialogue occurring jesse rosenthal q analyst creditsights inc fair enough and then just a quick followup on just if you were to pursue an exchange or just in general if any issuer pursues an exchange are there any potential regulatory issues or concerns with losing capital treatment there if youre specifically exchanging a preferred that has less than five years to the first call michael verdeschi a treasurer citigroup inc look i think those are theres a variety of topics that weve had to cover tax regulatory we dont believe that would present a problem for us so weve done a lot of work in this space theres more work to be done but given the nature of why were doing such workaround this in terms of a consideration we dont believe that would be problematic
