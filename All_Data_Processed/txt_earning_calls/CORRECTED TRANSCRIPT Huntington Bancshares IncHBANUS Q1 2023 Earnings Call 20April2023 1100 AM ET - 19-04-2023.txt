detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our first quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of and adjusted eps of return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was further adjusting for aoci rotce was preprovision net revenue expanded yearoveryear to million loan balances continued to grow as total loans increased by billion from the prior quarter liquidity coverage remains robust with over billion of available liquidity representing a peer leading coverage of uninsured deposits of credit quality remains strong with net chargeoffs of basis points and allowance for credit losses of turning to slide average loan balances increased quarteroverquarter driven by commercial loans which increased by billion or from the prior quarter primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance which increased million tied to continued normalization of dealer inventory levels as well as seasonality with shipments of spring equipment arriving to dealers corporate and specialty banking increased million primarily driven by growth in midcorp healthcare and tech and telecom other asset finance businesses contributed growth of million auto floorplan continued normalization with balances higher by million business banking also increased million in consumer growth continued to be led by residential mortgage which increased by million partially offsetting this growth were home equity balances which declined by million all other categories including rvmarine and auto declined by a collective million turning to slide we continued to deliver average deposit growth in the first quarter balances were higher by million primarily driven by consumer which more than offset lower commercial balances on a yearover year basis average deposits increased by billion or turning to slide i want to share more details behind huntingtons deposit franchise our deposit base represents a leading percentage of insured deposits at as of q1 our deposit base is highly diversified with consumer deposits representing over half of our total deposits and the average consumer balance being turning to slide complementing our diversified deposit base is the stability and growth of our deposits over time during last year we consistently delivered deposit growth well above peer levels despite the backdrop of rising rates and quantitative tightening through yearend cumulative deposit growth was nearly percentage points better than the peer median huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 over the course of q1 monthly average deposit balances were stable at approximately billion within consumer deposits balances have increased for four months in a row total commercial balances were modestly lower consistent with expected seasonality during march in addition to seasonality commercial customers also incrementally utilized our off balance sheet liquidity solutions turning to slide we have a sophisticated approach to customer liquidity management that comprises both on balance sheet deposit products as well as offbalance sheet alternatives over the past four years we have invested substantially to build out these solutions to ensure were managing our customers overall liquidity needs the enhanced liquidity solutions allow us to manage the full customer relationship with primary bank and operating deposits onbalance sheet and utilizing our offbalance sheet solutions for investments or non operational funds over the course of and we intentionally leveraged these off balance sheet solutions in order to support our customers excess liquidity this resulted in fewer surge deposits coming on sheet as well as less commercial deposit runoff during compared to the industry on a yearoveryear basis our commercial banking segment onbalance sheet deposits increased and our offbalance sheet liquidity balances increased during march this approach yet again showed its value for both huntington and our customers we saw customers moving a modest amount of deposit balances into treasuries and other products while we were able to maintain those primary operating accounts on our balance sheet of the total change in commercial segment deposit balances between march and the end of q1 we estimate that approximately half the delta was attributable to normal seasonality and the remainder was mainly the result of shifts into our offbalance sheet solutions the bottom table highlights these movements as well as trends in the first two weeks of april on balance sheet deposits have returned to the march level and offbalance sheet continues to grow turning to slide our liquidity capacity is robust our two primary sources of liquidity cash and borrowing capacity at the fhlb and federal reserve represented billion and billion respectively at the end of q1 as part of our ongoing liquidity management we continually seek to maximize contingent borrowing capacity and as of april our total cash and available borrowing capacity increased to billion at quarter end this pool of available liquidity represented of total uninsured deposits a pure leading coverage on to slide for the quarter net interest income decreased by million or to billion driven by lower day count and lower net interest margin yearoveryear nii increased million or net interest margin decreased basis points on a gaap basis from the prior quarter and decreased basis points on a core basis excluding accretion the reduction in gaap nim included basis points from lower spreads net of free funds due to funding mix and marginally accelerated interest costs it also included basis points from the first substantive negative carry impact from our longterm down rate nim hedging program and basis points from higher cash levels slide highlights our ongoing disciplined management of deposit costs and funding for the current cycle to date our beta on total cost of deposits was as weve noted we expect deposit rates to continue to trend higher from here over the course of the rate cycle given the recent market environment at the margin we do expect a steeper nearterm trajectory turning to slide our hedging program is dynamic continually optimized and welldiversified our objectives are to protect capital in up rate scenarios and to protect nim in down rate scenarios during the first quarter we huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 added to the hedge portfolio with both of these objectives in mind on the capital protection front we added billion in additional pay fixed swaps and billion in forward starting pay fixed swaptions throughout the quarter we were deliberate in managing the balance sheet to benefit from asset sensitivity we also incrementally added to our hedge position to manage possible downside rate risks over the longer term as well as took actions to optimize the nearterm cost of the program during the quarter we executed a net million of receivefixed swaps terminated billion of swaps and entered into billion of floor spreads as weve noted before our intention is to manage nim in a tighter corridor as possible as we protect the downside and maintain upside potential if rates stay higher for longer turning to slide on our securities portfolio we saw another step up in reported yields quarteroverquarter we benefited from higher reinvestment yields as well as our hedges to protect capital from a portfolio strategy perspective we expect to continue to add to the allocation of shorter duration exposures to benefit from the inverted yield curve and further enhance the liquidity profile of the portfolio you will note that fair value marks at the end of march were lower than yearend both in the afs and htm portfolios as market interest rates moved lower sequentially importantly we have also shown a million total positive fair value mark from our pay fixed hedges which are intended to protect capital moving on to slide noninterest income was million up million from last quarter these results include the million gain on the sale of our retirement plan services business during the quarter excluding that gain adjusted noninterest income was million this result was somewhat lower than the guidance we provided in early march driven by lower capital markets revenues given the disruptions at the end of q1 the first quarter is generally a seasonal low for fee revenues as weve noted previously we see q1 excluding the rps sale being the low point and for fees to grow over the course of the year driven by solid underlying performance in our key areas of strategic focus capital markets payments and wealth management moving on to slide gaap noninterest expense increased by million adjusted for notable items core expenses decreased by million driven by lower personnel expense primarily as a result of reduced incentives and revenue driven compensation were proactively managing expenses and have taken actions over the last several quarters to orient to a low level of expense growth in order to deliver positive operating leverage and selffund strategic investments slide recaps our capital position common equity tier increased to and has increased sequentially for three quarters oci impacts to common equity tier resulted in an adjusted cet1 ratio of as a reminder the reported regulatory capital framework does not include oci impacts in the capital calculation our tangible common equity ratio or tce increased basis points to note that we were holding higher cash balances at the end of q1 which reduced the tce ratio by basis points adjusting for aoci our tce ratio was tangible book value per share increased by from the prior quarter to adjusting for aoci tangible book value increased to and has increased for the past four quarters our capital management strategy for the balance of will result in expanding capital over the course of the year while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth we intend to grow cet1 to the top end of our to operating range by the end of the year we believe this is a prudent approach given the dynamic environment based on our expectation for continued loan growth we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program during turning to slide our capital plus reserve is top quartile in the peer group and gives us substantial total loss absorption capacity on slide credit quality continues to perform very well as mentioned net chargeoffs were huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 basis points for the quarter this was higher than last quarter by basis points and up basis points from the prior year as chargeoffs continued to normalize nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for seven consecutive quarters allowance for credit losses was flat at of total loans turning to slide we have provided incremental disclosures on our commercial real estate balances this portfolio is welldiversified and at of total loans is in line with the peer group with no outsized exposures the majority of the property types are multifamily and industrial over the last two years we have grown our cre book at a slower pace relative to the industry and peers we remain conservative in our credit approach to cre with rigorous client selection total office cre comprises less than of total loans and the majority are suburban and multitenant properties reserve coverage on our total cre portfolio is and the office portfolio is lets turn to our outlook on slide as we have discussed we analyzed multiple potential economic scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans we also remain dynamic in the current environment as we execute on our strategies our guidance is anchored on a baseline scenario that is informed by the consensus economic outlook we have also based our guidance on a range of interest rate scenarios bounded on the low end using the forward curve as of the end of march to one at the higher end where rates are higher for longer with fed funds remaining at approximately todays level over the rest of the year on loans our outlook range continues to be growth between and on an average basis and as before we expect this growth to be led by commercial with more modest growth in consumer as we entered the year we were trending to the middle to higher portion of that growth range given the market disruption and our incremental focus on optimizing loan growth for the highest returns on capital we now expect to be in the lower half to midpoint of this range on deposits we are guided by our core strategy of acquiring and deepening primary bank relationships were narrowing our outlook with a slightly lower top end of the range and still expect to grow average deposits between and however the composition of deposit growth from here we now expect to be primarily consumer led with relatively less commercial growth net interest income is now expected to increase between and this is driven by slightly lower loan growth and marginally higher funding costs noninterest income on a core full year basis is expected to be flat to down the updated guidance reflects modestly lower expected growth in capital markets fees and includes the goforward impact of the rps business sale as noted we expect q1 to be the low point for fees growing over the course of the year led by capital markets payments and wealth management on expenses we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low level were benefiting from our ongoing efficiency initiatives such as operation accelerate branch optimization the voluntary retirement program and the organizational realignment providing the capacity to selffund sustained investment in our key growth initiatives given a somewhat lower revenue outlook we are taking actions to incrementally reduce the expense growth in for the full year we now expect core expense growth between and plus the incremental expenses from the full year run rate of capstone and torana and the increased fdic insurance expense overall our low expense growth coupled with expanded revenues is expected to support another year of positive operating leverage we continue to expect net chargeoffs will be on the low end of our longterm through the cycle range of to basis points huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 finally turning to slide as you heard from steve the foundation we have built at huntington over the last decade has created an institution that is wellprepared for this environment we will leverage the strength of our deposit base were focused on growing capital and maintaining robust liquidity we remain disciplined in our credit posture and were executing our core strategy the work we have done to build the franchise positions huntington to outperform and be ready to opportunistically seize on pockets of growth we will remain disciplined and dynamic in our management approach as we continue to generate longterm value for our shareholders with that we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you and at this time we will conduct our questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please state your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc as i look through your deposit flows for the quarter youve clearly done better than peers whether its on total deposits or even just noninterest bearing deposits can you break out what you saw in the background was there a lot of movement with new accounts coming in and some of those existing commercial clients moving off balance sheet and if so can you talk about how sticky you think some of those new account openings are zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks manan this is zach ill take that question and its a good one overall what we saw in our deposit base during the quarter was tremendous stability and that continued not only through the month of march but into early april and weve tried to provide some incremental disclosures about that so we could get the visibility and for us its not surprising as weve noted quite a bit its very granular very diversified and overall it didnt happen by accident its a function of a really long strategy we have to focus on primary bank relationships as you know and to develop this commercial offbalance sheet capability that we described in the prepared remarks huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 to get to your question in particular what we saw generally i would note by the way that when youre looking at balances on a daybyday basis as weve provided them in that disclosure you have to take them with a note of caution it really matters what day of the week what week of the month etcetera with payroll days and tax payments etcetera generally we expect the end of march to be a seasonal low for commercial and so most of the movement around half of the movement we saw in commercial from lets say the average of march down to the end of march was really just bau movements of commercial clients largely paying out payroll the other half was largely movements of deposits off balance sheet as very marginal amount of customers use those offbalance sheet solutions to leverage that product set interestingly what you can see is by this disclosure out into the first two weeks of april is that essentially it came back in terms of the overall balance of commercial deposits so its very stable virtually no movement on the question of what we saw ins and out we of course saw some acquisition and we continue to acquire in every segment that were operating in consumer indiscernible business banking and commercial as well and so we feel good about that kind of longterm program which is one of the things that underlies our continued expectation for deposits growth throughout the rest of this year just continuing to stay on a strategy of acquiring and deepening our primary bank relationships manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and then just separately can you talk about the funding and liquidity side of the balance sheet so despite the low level of deposit outflow i think you built up some cash and liquidity levels by taking on more wholesale funding so how should we think about that as we get through the rest of this year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah in terms of overall funding mix weve talked about this a number of times in prior quarters we really like where were coming to this rate cycle from a perspective of lots of balance options to fund the business were growing loans at this point between and and deposits were between and around call it the midpoint of that range so that allows us to also leverage other sources of funding to overall fund the balance sheet and were in a great position to be able to do that i will tell you internally we really like that it creates quite a bit of tension in the system of where the next unit of funding is coming and really it is optimized from the economic perspective and so our expectation is to continue to essentially add to each of those funding categories over the foreseeable future while still maintaining a level thats comparatively quite good relative to history for us so thats the overall plan on the topic of liquidity i would just note a couple of things this is a key risk that the company has been focused on managing for more than a decade we purposely create exceptionally robust pools of contingent liquidity to cover any potential issue i think we noted in the deck some of the key sources of liquidity and also whether that we continue to over time add to them i will tell you that one of the statistics thats in the document today highlights billion of contingent cash and borrowing capacity as of last friday im pleased to report that as of this morning theres an incremental effort weve done now billion which in total represents relative to our insured deposits so exceptionally strong liquidity profile and as i said kind of very balanced funding base huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore please state your question zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi you mentioned the actions youve taken incrementally to lower expense growth across the firm are those actions factored into your to expense guidance and also what are those actions involved thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question john this is zach ill elaborate on that so the short answer to your question is yes our guidance of to underlying core growth includes those actions and i think just back to the sort of strategic intent of it as weve said for a while we are very intent on driving a low level of overall expense growth and really leveraging our ongoing program of efficiency initiatives to do that even while we continue to drive outsized growth and selffund investments within that overall low growth framework and so as we came into this updated guidance period where we saw somewhat lower revenue trajectory for us it was important kind of continue to execute on the discipline of driving the positive operating leverage but also ratchet down expenses i think the kind of things that we do we always enter the year with a contingent set of expense management options a menu you could think about it of different kind of options we could undertake if we needed to and thats essentially what were going to go through now well modulate the pace of hiring well be very judicious in the discretionary expense categories and we will look at sort of every possible area of expense control to ratchet back expenses and offset a good amount of what was otherwise profit revenue pressures so thats the playbook and something weve done numerous times over the course of years and so we feel really good about it and were executing it now john pancari q analyst evercore isi huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 okay great all right thanks and then on the back to the balance sheet can you just give us your expectation in terms of an updated through cycle deposit beta i believe you had expected previously but if you can update us there on what youre thinking and also what net interest margin outlook is baked into your up to net interest income projection thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc you got it john let me elaborate more on that overall pulling back overall the strategy we have is to continue to drive sustained growth in net interest income in dollar basis and to do that driving continual growth and high return in all categories coupling that with the management of nim around a tighter corridor as we can with the top end benefits from our continued asset sensitivity and we said thats really benefited indiscernible a lot higher for longer but also at the lower end protected with our hedge portfolio all that adds up to the to nii growth that weve guided to on beta and particularly to answer your question it clearly is a more competitive environment and hence its realistic to expect some higher beta and slightly an earlier impact than we had previously seen i do expect now a few percentage points higher than the original than the prior guidance of beta i will note that we provide prior guidance on beta because we want to give you an indication of where we think thats going but for us the most important thing is the execution day to day of driving the deposit growth and staying incredibly disciplined in terms of the overall funding mix as i noted in my prior response how beta ultimately plays out here over the end game is going to be clearly a function of where this yield curve goes but i do think that a few percent higher than is a reasonable range based on the two scenarios i laid out in terms of overall spread as we noted weve moved the guidance range from it was previously to to to so down about in terms of that guidance range about of that is just slightly lower loan growth and the rest is spread as i think about the kind of the way the year plays out i would expect that a more frontloaded impact of spreads than we were previously expecting so we would expect to see decline in nii in q2 about the same as we saw in q1 but then growing from there and i think the nim range that we have there is sort of consistent with that dollar trend john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please state your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc two questions one in terms of the deposit growth outlook i think you mentioned its expected to be more consumerled just give us a sense of strategically how either the interest rate environment or the events of the last month have changed how you are thinking about deposit acquisition and has it materially changed the pricing on a new deposit growth relative to how we thought about it back in january zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks ebrahim overall i would say as we noted weve tightened the range with a kind of a lower top end but still expect growth pretty consistent with what we have thought before in terms of the overall indiscernible growth so we still see nice traction and i think youd see that a little bit in some of the disclosures weve given just in the first weeks of april for example with that being said i think the mix will be different and we now expect commercial to be largely flat from here and really the growth to be consumerled frankly from our perspective its a great highlight of the strength of the consumer franchise that weve got that we can lean in down and continue to support high profit loan growth with that consumer funding i think the dust has not settled in terms of all of the competitive and customer behavioral impacts of the last month but i think one of them will prove to be more moderated commercial growth and well just be deleveraging the offbalance sheet structures that much more to ensure that what we do have on sheet is incredibly stable and on the consumer side just running the same playbook that we have we have invested so much over the last few years in capabilities to build our marketing technology and customer targeting capability within the consumer that we really have the opportunity now to optimize and to drive incremental consumeroriented acquisition indiscernible but just fundamentally were growing we noted a growth in very very big relationships on the consumer side growth in business banking and so its a very balanced source of growth and were just going to lean into indiscernible overall fund the balances ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just as a followup i guess on the lending side so appreciate your comments in terms of where the growth has been and the outlook but if you could give us a sense of just customer sentiment given your business mix some of the legacy tcf businesses just the health of the economy in terms of when you speak to your customers are you seeing a slowdown in demand also occurring at the same time which increases the likelihood of a potential downturn and a recession based on what youre seeing huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim this is steve and thank you for the question we are seeing customers become more cautious in some cases deferring investments andor postponing acquisitions or other transactions and this has increased during the quarter its one of the reasons weve sort of guided without changing the loan range to the lower end of that loan range from where we wouldve been at the upper end of that loan range at the end of theres clearly more angst about is there a recession and what will look having said that many of these customers are doing quite well in thus far and remain optimistic but again theres been a lot of media a lot of headline noise and its having an impact in addition to what the feds doing ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks steve thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks ebrahim operator thank you our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please state your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co zach i was hoping you could hey zach i was hoping you could expand upon some of the nii comments from a question or so ago so i think if i interpreted you correctly i guess nii will take a step down in the second quarter what would cause the margin or nii to start expanding from there in light of i guess fairly limited overall balance sheet growth through the remainder of the year just curious about the nuances as you see them zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think mainly its going to be volume from there scott just continue to sequentially grow loans from second into third and third into fourth quarter is the primary driver that we see spreads much more flat in the back half and then kind of accelerated in fact what i just maybe elaborating a little bit on the nim trajectory that we huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 see nothing overly precise we walked into the year we were expecting frankly a pretty ratable trend in nim over the course of the year i think at that time we provided some guidance around singledigit basis points to kind of trajectory throughout the course of the year but most of that we now see kind of frontloaded just based on the shape of the curve and kind of how the outlook has shaped up at this point so thats really the driver overall my outlook for nim is maybe or basis points lower on a full year basis to give you a sense a portion of which is yield but most of which is just funding costs being slightly higher r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc scott so remember we are a large equipment finance lender and that generally has much more activity in the fourth quarter thats part of this second half build that zach referenced r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then can you guys speak broadly to some of the trends youre seeing in the auto portfolio i mean i know your portfolio just given the quality and tenure of it it tends to be a lot different than the industry as a whole but at least in the media you would think that the industry is sort of collapsing i guess just curious that top level trends or appetite from you guys and then what youre seeing at sort of overall richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah hey scott this is rich ill take that and then zach or steve can tack on to it so from my standpoint on the current side as we showcased during investor day i mean this is really a business we like through all sorts of cycles i mean it has become truly a core competency of the bank if you look at what we saw in the first quarter it was a continued gradual normalization in both delinquencies and chargeoffs but its still trending well below the historic losses that we would normally see it was basis points in the first quarter up from in the fourth quarter from my standpoint i looked really closely at the origination metrics that weve got were still originating at ficos north of and the longer values are remaining relatively constant reflecting a little bit more mix in new versus new so from my standpoint were going to expect this portfolio to continue to showcase our best loss performance and unemployment rates are still low which is certainly going to help the credit metrics here thats the big driver of losses so im feeling good about it and maybe zach can talk about the optimization that weve got from a return on capital standpoint zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure ill just tack onto that ive said in the comments that indiscernible feel great about the trajectory of the portfolio we still see sustained demand and great relationships by way of our dealers so i think were a core digital funding partner for the deals which really gives us great access huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 in terms of our position that is one of the other loan categories that we are actively modulating we had detailed this in investor day last november im sure you remember but thats the business that is so effectively managed with respect to pricing and volume tradeoffs so we can really pull those levers quite effectively to drive higher returns and higher yields at times that we need to this is certainly one of them and so were bringing back production of it and seeing really strong returns as a result of it so well see some of that indiscernible as we go forward for the rest of the year but netnet its totally an important business for us and were pleased with the trends that we see r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you for all the color zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs please state your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i just had one followup question for steve so steve your starting point of cet1 is you accrete about basis points of capital or more in a quarter and like you said your allowance already account for a tougher economic environment i think your shareholders absolutely appreciate the focus on returns but do you see an opportunity for huntington if perhaps as we have a little bit more clarity on the downside to the macro backdrop to take advantage of that capital and reserve resilience so to speak and perhaps start thinking about being more opportunistic in market share taking stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks for the question we do we have focused on and well continue throughout the year to building the capital position the company strengthening it were quite pleased with the results delivered in the first quarter and look for comparable results as we go through the year where were intending to be at or near the highend of our cet1 range and were doing that with a view that this threat of a recession is increasing and theres also a backdrop that theres going to be some kind of regulatory actions at some point in the foreseeable future around capital requirements so with that in mind thats the purpose of it having said that we intend to be opportunistic weve got a lot of organic growth potential in the business lines were very focused on our execution and as you saw last year with the acquisition of capstone and torana were huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 always looking to build up ancillary fee businesses within the company beyond that in times of disruptions there tend to be people or teams that might be available and well again look to be opportunistic there and we see this in aggregate as a moment to take market share and thats where were driving towards were investing in the businesses the outlook that zach has shared with you well have continued investment in businesses all of which is designed to enhance our grow our earnings and enhance our returns erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just to be clear steve i was asking about organic opportunities that wasnt a hidden bank acquisition question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah im glad you clarified i thought you might be going in a different direction erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yeah absolutely and just as a followup to that zach heard you loud and clear in terms of continuing to optimize the righthand side of your balance sheet as you think about senior debt issuance i suspect that everything that you may be doing in the future would have a ph land towards the potential for tlac eligibility zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc its certainly on the thought process erika yes were watching that development carefully still pretty early days clearly to see where that might land but its part of the thought process erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please state your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning hey stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 just one followup on the capital front zach you show on that slide where the current potential impact of afs would be on cet1 im just wondering do you have a rule of thumb if we kept all rates equal on just how fast that would pull to par either on a sequential basis or maybe by the end of zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes yes its a great question and considerable analysis around it its around to a year depending on what year it is indiscernible totally flat curve basis ill give you a sense weve just run this analysis on the forward curve as of march itll be recapture by the end of in a forward curve scenario i was just indiscernible in that one of interest rates declining relative to kind of flat scenario ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and just one question on the assets repricing side you guys have some fixed rate assets that are still repricing even though i understand how youre slowing production just can you give us a sense on just what your front book back book benefits are in some of your fixed rate portfolios and have we even really started to see some of those benefits come through given where rates have moved to zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question we look at that very carefully and were seeing really nice stepup in loan yields indiscernible new volume rates up almost basis points sorry new volume up almost basis points back book up almost basis points in q1 we estimate that our loan beta at this point through q1 is and that could easily be over in the next couple of years approaching so you just sort of model the yield curve so were a little further through the loan beta than we are with the deposit beta but not much and theres certainly much more room to go in terms of loan yields from here just given kind of about just over of the portfolio is in auto that the churn is pretty quick just over two years so kind of get the benefit of that repricing in a somewhat delayed but impactful beta there and then obviously the sort of the longer dated loan book likewise is seeing a nice reset in terms of rates and so thatll benefit us over the coming quarters as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks zach operator thank you next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc please state your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey few questions here zach on slide that green line on the bottom the last time you said it took a couple of quarters for deposit cost to roll over after the fed stopped if were done in may do you think that relationship holds is it two quarters and deposit costs stopped going up is that fair zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc generally the expectation is up jon yes based on just the prior indiscernible kind of function of the pace with which rates might begin to decline and also what the kind of economic environment hence the kind of loan growth environment across the industry that would affect the competitive environment of deposit so that will clearly play into it but generally our planning assumption is as you noted which is very much in keeping with what weve seen not only in the last fed cycle but in multiple fed cycles ph for that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough steve or rich maybe for one of you you used the term in the deck rigorous client selection for commercial real estate can you talk a little bit more about what you go through help us understand the type of work you do and do you think this is different than what your peers are doing richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i really cant speak to what our peers are doing but i can tell you that we for years now have developed a process of really fine tuning who we do business with in the states as you know real estate cycles and you have to be able to depend on who youre doing business with to support their projects and so we have really narrowed the funnel around the types of sponsors that we work with and we said we hear them we look at their just how long theyve been in business we looked at their financial wherewithal we look at their liquidity and more importantly we look at how theyve behaved in past cycles and we ph curate them and our curating drives how much well ph have out to any particular sponsor how big of a single project we will have for them and other metrics associated with that so right now we are focused on serving the core and that will serve us well going forward stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc look jon were always disciplined in our credit i think thats going to prove to be the case as we come through the cycle obviously pleased with where we are at the moment so well see but i can tell you especially in cre where we had enormous challenges in we have sustained the disciplined here since that time and rich has been a big part of it along with our lending teams jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 yeah good one more for you steve i know this seems like a softball but its not im genuinely curious but what surprised you the most over the past six weeks as you managed through some of the disruption stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the speed of the run on the banks was a surprise jon faster than anything weve seen that i can ever recall and i think as a consequence of regulators and others maybe a little behind what they because they didnt expect it either and thats why i think its a couple of weeks to get svb resolved and signature as well normally theres more front end planning they had a chance to light things up this turned into a little bit more of a scramble having said that i thought the reaction on that sunday night from treasury indiscernible was just outstanding timing and fully appropriate jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator and our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan chase please state your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so on the net interest income outlook which is taken down a bit given everything zach you detailed on the swaps and the forward curve as of right now where do you see yourself trending within that is there a bias either to the upside or downside within that range right now zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc when we set these ranges we try to set them with our general expectations indiscernible so thats just kind of a baseline expectation i think kind of what the puts and takes that would take you to the high and the low end including volume on one hand and just sort of the shape of the yield curve and the indiscernible on the other hand so its hard to generalize but we feel quite good about landing in that range at this point and thats what were guiding for steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and is the way we should think about it so if were at the low end of the nii range should then we should be at the low end of the expense guidance should we just connect those two huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc generally speaking that is the way we think of them we throttle the expense growth based on where the revenue trajectory is going and thats why we try to have a really disciplined forecasting process because as weve said multiple economic scenarios and we try to do that obviously the expense lever takes some time to pull and so you need to have good line of sight to where thats going and so its possible indiscernible rapid move or surprising move but thats not possible ph unless youre given a short time period but over the longer term yes steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks so maybe just one last one for steve just following up on your response just now to jons question given the speed at which deposits went out silicon valley bank when you look at that do you view that from a distance as a unique oneoff event or are there lessons that youre now applying the way you think about managing capital risk liquidity that even a stable regional bank like yourself will change potentially fairly materially in the aftermath of what we just saw thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steve i think there are always lessons learned but the business models of svb and signature were so different from us and other regional banks but particularly from us the concentrations of the uninsured deposit were about just in retrospect it seems rather clear that the liquidity risk was very very different and a huge mess combined with the asset liability in terms of lessons for us its indiscernible that much more aware of liquidity weve always seen this as a prime risk weve always set good backup and weve been very granular an advantage to have that bestinclass uninsured to total deposit ratio but well probably be more even more cautious that probably well be even more cautious given the speed at which things move as we go forward having said all that were in a very strong position today we expect to grow deposits as we continue through the year and so its like extra vigilance we may do some policy adjustments to reinforce and strengthen further but that will be of minor nature i dont think it will impact our performance steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session i would like to turn
