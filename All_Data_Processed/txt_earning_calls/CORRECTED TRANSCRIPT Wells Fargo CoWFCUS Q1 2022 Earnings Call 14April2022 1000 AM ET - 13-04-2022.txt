good morning everyone ill make some brief comments about our first quarter results the operating environment and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review the first quarter results in more detail before we take your question let me start off with some first quarter highlights we earned billion or per common share in the first quarter our results included per share impact from a decrease in the allowance for credit losses we have broadbased loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the fourth quarter while net interest income was down modestly from the fourth quarter driven by fewer days in the quarter it grew from a year ago higher interest rates along with our expectations for continued loan growth should drive higher net interest income growth that we anticipated at the beginning of the year mike will provide more details regarding our current view later on in the call however the increase in rates negatively impacted our mortgage banking business the mortgage origination market experienced one of its largest quarterly declines that i can remember and it will take time for the industry to reduce excess capacity credit performance remained incredibly strong and our net chargeoff ratio declined to basis points while we have minimal direct exposure to russia or ukraine were monitoring certain industries that have the potential to wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 be impacted by the conflict and economic sanctions but thus far dont have concerns in addition we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter including repurchasing billion of common stock and increasing our common stock dividend to per share the significant changes weve made across the company have put us in a position to increase the dividend and our work continues the health of our consumer and businesses so far has remained strong though were entering a period of uncertainty march was the eighth straight month in which inflation outpaced income with lower income consumers being most impacted by rising energy and food prices that said higher deposit balances and rising wages have thus far allowed consumers to weather these headwinds we continued to see median deposit balances above prepandemic levels up approximately compared to but down from the highs observed in consumer credit card spend remained strong up from a year ago all spending categories were up with the highest growth in travel entertainment fuel and dining after strong growth in the first quarter of driven by stimulus payments debit card spending increased in the first quarter of discretionary spending remained strong with entertainment up and travel up from a year ago the increase in energy prices was reflected in a increase in fuel spending loan demand from our commercial customers increased with growth in both commitments and loans outstanding as customers borrowing needs are increasing to fund working capital expansion credit quality remains strong with net recoveries in our commercial portfolio now let me update you on progress weve made on our strategic priorities building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority and i continue to believe that were making significant progress early in the first quarter we named derek flowers our new chief risk officer following mandy nortons retirement announcement derek has extensive experience managing risk including the work hes done over the last several years of managing the buildout of wells fargos risk and control framework derek has been with wells fargo for over years and his familiarity with the company and his risk background make him the ideal candidate to succeed mandy who id like to thank for the tremendous progress she made in transforming the risk organization we also continued to make progress in resolving legacy regulatory issues with news in january that the occ had terminated a consent order regarding addon products that the company sold to retail banking customers before we have much more work to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements and we will likely have setbacks but im confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years we remain focused on improving our financial performance while investing to drive growth across our businesses providing our customers with simple easytouse and fast digital experiences is one of our most important strategic priorities in the first quarter we began rolling out our new mobile banking experience for our customers in our consumer businesses and feedback has been very positive digital adoption which is critical to both delivering seamless digital experiences that our customers expect and reducing the cost to serve has continued to increase with mobile active customers up from a year ago we added approximately new mobile active customers in the first quarter alone we continue to invest to improve our digital capabilities with additional enhancements planned for this year were also focused on reducing friction in moving money weve continued to invest in zelle and made changes to expand customer usage including increasing spending limits these changes have helped to drive growth in active send customers and a increase in send volume from a year ago we continued to enhance our credit card offerings with our partnership with bilt rewards and mastercard this firstofitskind cobrand card allows members to pay rent and earn points with no transaction fees on rent payments at any apartment in the us in the first quarter we selected ncino to streamline our origination wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 underwriting and portfolio management for our small business customers this collaboration is expected to provide our customers with a more streamlined lending experience and builds on our existing relationship that we announced last year to accelerate our digital transformation within our commercial banking and corporate investment banking businesses let me just make some summary comments before i turn it over to mike as we sit here today our internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers financial position but the federal reserve has made it clear that itll take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth in addition the war in ukraine adds additional risks to the downside wells fargo is positioned well to provide support for our clients in a slowing economy while we will likely see an increase in credit losses from historical lows we should be a net beneficiary as we will also benefit from rising rates we have a strong capital position and our lower expense base creates greater margins from which to invest we remain diligent in extending credit and are focusing on managing the other risk types within the company as well we remain on target to achieve a sustainable rotce subject to the same assumptions weve discussed in the past on a run rate basis at some point this year we continue to focus on a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions as weve all seen the reports and images coming out of ukraine are deeply concerning in order to support those most impacted we announced million in donations across three nonprofits in support of humanitarian aid for ukraine and ukrainian refugees as well as services that support the us military earlier this week we also announced plans to introduce hope inside centers in select branches to increase access to financial education and guidance working with operation hope is one important way that we can remove barriers to financial inclusion as part of our banking inclusion initiative which is focused on helping more people who are unbanked gain access to affordable mainstream banking products since the pandemic began close to of our employees never left the workplace and last month we started to welcome the rest back to the office its been great to be back together again and i want to thank all of our employees as they work together to better serve our customers our communities and each other i will now turn the call over to mike michael santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the quarter was billion or per common share and our results included a billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses predominantly due to reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of covid on our loan portfolios our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was approximately which included net discrete income tax benefits due to stockbased compensation we expect our effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately excluding any additional discrete items our cet1 ratio declined to still wellabove our regulatory minimum of we highlight capital on slide the decrease in our cet1 ratio from the fourth quarter reflected a billion reduction in cumulative other comprehensive income driven by higher interest rate and wider agency mbs spreads which reduced the ratio by approximately basis points higher riskweighted assets driven by growth in loan balances and commitments we adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk which had a minimal impact on total risk weighted asset and we continued with our strong capital returns wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 we repurchased billion of common stock in the first quarter bringing our total repurchases since the third quarter of to billion which is in line with our capital plan while we have flexibility under the stress capital buffer framework to exceed the share repurchases contemplated in our capital plan we will be disciplined in our approach given the current rate volatility and currently expect to have significantly lower levels of share buybacks in the second quarter finally weve submitted our capital plan and as ive called out before its possible that our stress capital buffer could increase when the federal reserve publishes our official stress capital buffer in the third quarter while our gsib surcharge of will remain the same for turning to credit quality on slide our net loan chargeoff ratio declined to basis points in the first quarter commercial credit performance was strong again with million of net recoveries in the first quarter driven by recoveries in energy assetbased lending and middlemarket consumer credit performance was also strong credit losses were down million from the fourth quarter which included million of net chargeoffs related to a change in practice to fully chargeoff certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans the first quarter included higher auto losses and seasonally higher credit card losses nonperforming assets decreased million or from the fourth quarter commercial nonaccruals were down million declining again this quarter and are now below prepandemic levels consumer nonaccruals increased million driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals primarily resulting from certain customers exiting covid related accommodation programs overall early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have exceeded our expectations our allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter reflect a continued strong credit performance less uncertainty around the economic impact of covid the economic recovery thus far and an outlook that reflects the increasing risks from high inflation in the russiaukraine conflicts on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans grew from a year ago in the fourth quarter period end loans grew for the third consecutive quarter and were up from a year ago with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios ill highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results average deposits increased billion or from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap turning to net interest income on slide first quarter net interest income increased million or from a year ago and declined million from the fourth quarter the decline from the fourth quarter was driven by million of lower income from epbo and paycheck protection program loans as well as two fewer days in the quarter which offset the impact of higher earning asset yields and higher securities and loan balances last quarter we highlighted that net interest income for full year could potentially increase by approximately driven by loan growth and other balance sheet mix changes as well as the benefit from rising rates which was based on the forward curve at that time obviously a lot has changed over the past three months loan growth has been solid and average loan balances were up versus the fourth quarter and at period end if we continue to see increased demand its possible that average loan balances will be up in the midsingle digits from the fourth quarter to fourth quarter up from our prior outlook earlier this year of lowtomid singledigits wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 the rate increases currently included in the forward rate curve would also drive stronger net interest income growth than we anticipated earlier in the year however its important to note that the benefit from rising rates is not linear and we would expect deposit betas to accelerate after the initial rate hikes and customer migration from loweryielding to higheryielding deposit products would also likely increase higher rates will also have a negative impact on mortgage volumes and potentially on marketrelated fees in corporate and investment banking private equity and venture capital businesses and in wealth management given our current expectations for higher loan growth and recent forward rate curves net interest income for full year could be up midteens on a percentage basis from that said net interest income growth will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors including the magnitude and timing of fed rate increases deposit betas and loan growth now turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses also declined due to divestitures last year the first quarter included approximately million of seasonally higher personnel expenses including payroll taxes restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401k matching contributions we also had million of operating losses which were primarily driven by higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters our full year expenses are still expected to be approximately billion however as we experienced this quarter operating losses can be episodic and hard to predict and we will continue to update you on our expense expectations throughout the year turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago primarily due to higher deposit balances higher depositrelated fees primarily reflecting lower fee waivers and an increase in debit card transactions we continue to reduce the underlying costs that run the business and serve customers customers have continued to migrate to digital channels and correspondingly teller transactions are down from prepandemic levels over the same period weve decreased our number of branches by and branch staffing by approximately and we have more opportunities to improve our efficiency while we continue to make enhancements to better serve customers earlier this year we announced changes we are making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees we began to implement some of these new policies and will be rolling out the rest of the changes this year we eliminated fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions in early march so these changes didnt have a meaningful impact on the first quarter results we still expect the annual decline in these fees to be approximately million however as we highlighted last quarter this is an annualized estimate and the reduction maybe partially offset by higher levels of activity and we will observe how customers respond to the new features that will be introduced in the latter part of the year home lending revenue declined from a year ago and from the fourth quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and press margins given the higherrate environment and competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry mortgage rates increased basis points in the first quarter and are above rate levels observed for most of the last decade reflecting this environment we expect second quarter originations and margins to remain under pressure and mortgage banking revenue to continue to decline weve started to reduce expenses in response to the decline in volume and expect expenses will continue to decline throughout the year as excess capacities removed in line to lower business activity wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 credit card revenue was up from a year ago driven by higher loan balances and pointofsale volumes auto revenue increased and personal lending was up from a year ago primarily due to higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide our mortgage originations declined for the fourth quarter we believe the mortgage market experiences the largest quarterly decline since primarily due to lower refinance activity in response to higher mortgage rates home lending loan balances grew modestly from the fourth quarter driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or epbos turning to auto our origination volume increased from a year ago but was down from fourth quarter due to credit tightening and higher risk segments and increased price competition as interest rates rose and we targeted solid returns for new originations turning to debit card transactions declined from the fourth quarter due to seasonality and were up from a year ago with doubledigit growth in travel and entertainment credit card pointofsale purchase volume continued to be strong was up from a year ago but down from the fourth quarter due to seasonality while payment rates remain elevated balances grew from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products new credit card accounts increased over from a year ago and we continue to be pleased by the quality of the accounts were attracting turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher deposit loan balances as well as the impact of higher interest rates assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher loan balances stronger net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments noninterest expense declined from year ago primarily driven by lower personnel and occupancy expense due to efficiency initiatives and lower lease expense after declining during the first half of last year average loan balances have grown for three consecutive quarters and were up from a year ago revolver utilization rates have increased but are still well below historical levels loan demand has been driven by larger clients who are increasing borrowing due to the impact of inflation on material and transportation costs as well as to support inventory growth were also seeing new demand from some clients who are catching up from underinvestment in projects and capital expenditures over the past couple years turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago primarily driven by higher loan balances and improved treasury management results average loan balances were up from year ago with increased demand across most industries driven primarily by capital expenditures and growing working capital needs commercial real estate revenue grew from year ago driven by the higher loan balances and higher revenue in our lowincome housing business average loan balances were up from year ago and originations in the first quarter outpaced volumes from year ago and loan pipelines continued to be strong markets revenues was down from year ago primarily due to lower trading activity residential mortgagebacked securities and high yield products average deposits in corporate and investment banking were down billion or from a year ago driven by continued actions to manage under the asset gap on slide wealth and investment management revenue grew from year ago driven by higher assetbased fees and higher market valuations and higher net interest income from the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher deposit loan balances as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 of the quarter so first quarter results reflected market valuations as of jan and second quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of april the increase in expenses from year ago is primarily driven by higher revenuerelated compensation which was more than offset by higher revenue average deposits were up from year ago and average loans increased from year ago driven by continued momentum in securities based lending slide highlights our corporate results both revenue and expenses declined from year ago driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio and divestitures of our corporate trust services business and wells fargo asset management these businesses contributed million of revenue in the first quarter of including the gain on sale of our student loan portfolio and they accounted for approximately million of the decline in expenses compared with year ago including the goodwill writedown of our student loan portfolio we will now take your questions question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers of piper sandler you may go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question mike i appreciated the commentary on reiterating the expense guidance for the full year was just hoping given sort of the lumpiness between the seasonality and the comp expenses and then some of the operating losses if you could maybe give a little bit more of a fine point on the trajectory in other words how much could we or should we expect things to come down in the second quarter and then is it going to be just a progressive decline through the end of the year or how will things ebb and flow in your mind michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah great thanks scott as i said in the remarks we had about million of seasonal expenses in there related to 401k and stock comp and all the associated stuff in the first quarter so that starts to fall away and then obviously the other piece in there that i mentioned was operating losses and that can be a little lumpy as you go throughout the year but when you sort of take a step back as you saw last year as well as we execute our efficiency initiatives you generally dont get all those benefits starting day one and so youll continue to get more and more impact throughout the year so you should expect the expense trajectory to be down as we go throughout the year now every quarter may not be down in a linear way but nonetheless youll see a trend downward and just to reinforce what we said in the remarks we did we are still we still believe the billion for the full year is achievable despite the fact that we had the higher operating losses in the quarter and then ill just reiterate the other piece of guidance we gave on nii we do think as we said in january we thought nii would be up about so were almost doubling that to kind of the midteens as we look throughout the year both given due to the loan growth weve seen and as well as the substantial move in rates wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then just maybe to follow up i think you guys talked in the past about an expectation for expenses decline next year as well just given how lasting some of these inflationary pressures seem to be do you see any risk to net outlook of another down year in cost next year charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co its charlie i would say a couple things i think its still the way we think about the way we want to plan for the year for sure as we sit here today on inflationary pressures i would say and its still early and still things will still continue to evolve but our own experience here is that the wage pressures that weve seen today are not as great as they were in the fourth quarter of last year so they still exist but they do seem to be slowing and obviously the fed is going to as i said going to do everything they can to bring that down and so as we sit here today by the time we get to next year i think well be in a very very different position relative to where inflation is and so were still very focused on indiscernible efficiency but were really focused on running the place better and thats what these expense reductions actually result r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you guys very much charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open sir steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to just start off with the question on nii and excess liquidity deployment specifically i was hoping you could speak to your appetite to deploy some of the excess liquidity that you guys still retain and where reinvestment yields are currently just given spread widening and mbs in particular and what securities you might look to purchase given some of the sensitivities on the duration side michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah thanks steve its mike look first when it comes to deploying liquidity its going to be loans first right so if you think about the waterfall and so as we see more loan growth thats where its going to go first and obviously thats the preferred path anyway and then based on what we see there we will decide if were going to grow the securities portfolio throughout the year i would say the guidance we gave for nii does not assume that we grow the portfolio any substantial way and so that will well have to see how that goes based on what we see from a loan growth perspective and then you can see where yields are across both the treasuries and mbs which are the two primary asset classes we have in the portfolio and i think obviously were now investing at higher rates than weve seen certainly in a while and thats additive as we go forward wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc all right and just one followup relating to deposit betas specifically certainly a big area of focus given the more aggressive pace of fed tightening as well as qt i was hoping you can just speak to your relative stickiness of your deposit base versus last cycle given the liability optimization you guys have been executing under the asset cap for a number of years now and is there a credible case in your view that deposit betas could in fact be lower this cycle just given some of that favorable deposit remixing michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no i think you highlighted the right points as you look at what weve had to do over the last couple of years to manage on to the asset cap weve really pushed away some of our most interest rate sensitive deposits during that time and so weve seen the least rate sensitive deposits on the retail side and consumer side grow as a percentage of the overall deposit base and so thats definitely going to help lower the average betas that well see relative to what we saw in the last cycle i think our expectations as you sort of think about the different slices of the deposit base havent really changed much over the last couple months i think as we look at the first basis points we dont think deposit rates are going to move that much which is pretty similar to what we saw last go around and then i think on the consumer side youll have slower betas and youll have higher betas on the wholesale side but likely given our position well lag a little bit on pricing given the asset cap than what weve got to do to continue to manage that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and this is charlie the only thing i would add is that i think a lot of also has the also depends on what the other alternatives for folks are out there certainly on the consumer side and when you look at the environment that were heading into and the volatility that well see i think thats a very different kind of environment than if youre in a very stable market and rates are just moving up relatively slowly so i think it is different in that respect as well steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc all right thats great if i could just squeeze in one more quick one would just be remiss if i didnt ask about given some of the fee income commentary that you guys had highlighted particularly some of the headwinds on both mortgage as well as wealth management how we should be thinking about the right jumping off point for fee income just given a lot of volatility in a few of those line items in the quarter michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah ill give you a couple points there so as you think about the advisory assets if you look at whats happened in both the fixed income and equity markets in terms of the valuation at the being down i think roughly or is probably not a bad place to start the modeling on advisory assets given the fact that a large chunk of them are billed in advance based on that value on the mortgage business we will see a stepdown given the pretty abrupt slowdown in the refinance market in particular we still expect to have decent volumes in the purchase market but spreads will definitely or gain on sale margins will definitely be impacted given theres still a lot of excess capacity in the system wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 now i would just keep that in context of the backdrop that we laid out in terms of the growth in nii as you look through the rest of the year so even if you start to see a little bit of pressure on those line items the growth in nii will position us pretty well throughout the rest of the year charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and this is charlie and the only thing i would just add to that i think when you think about how we are and i kind of said this in the quote and in my remarks the way were positioned going into an environment like this is we feel very positive about where we stand and mortgage banking income is going to decline because rates are going up and were going to make much more on the increase in rates than we will on the decline in mortgage banking income were continued focused on reducing expenses credit is still exceptionally good and certainly will be until the next quarter based on everything that we see possibly beyond even though at one point they will go up and so while were not sure what the overall economic environment will look like that doesnt change our point of view on the fact that were wellpositioned for it indiscernible michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and i would just just a reminder as i said in my script steve too on the impact of the reduction in non sufficient fund balance fees and some of the overdraft changes we made youll start to see the impact of that in the second quarter as well steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks so much for taking my questions michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah operator the next question comes from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the expense side appreciate you helping us out with the billion in terms of the reiteration of the guide on the operating loss side how do you feel about that billion expectation given the pressure on the number in the quarter and then separately i guess also on the cost savings want to see how youre feeling about the billion in gross saves and billion net any changes to that expectation thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so ill take the first part mike and maybe you take the second on the first one the things that we saw in the first quarter are very specific to remediations and so what we saw in the first quarter really has nothing to do with what well see in the next series of quarters and so those kind of stand on their own and is not something that gets built on from there wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and as you look at the efficiency and i think hopefully this was implied in the guidance we gave but were executing well on the efficiency program that weve got and as ive said a number of times over the last couple quarters its not a static program like this is something that were embedding in the da of how we run the place and it continues to evolve and we feel good about executing on that john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then on the capital side i know the cet1 decline of basis points this quarter you also mentioned the scb surcharge could increase you did flag lower levels of buyback expected for the second quarter maybe can you talk about your thoughts on capital return beyond the second quarter just given how things are shaping up and your earnings outlook indiscernible updated thoughts there thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i mean ill start mike and then you can chime in i think what were just trying to do is just its we do have the reality of the impact on oci during the quarter and so you see where cet1 is our dividend is about billion quarter or so so we do have plenty of room inside there for any other further changes to oci or the ability for us to grow rwa which we want to do as loan growth continues to show the demand that were seeing and so i think just where we are specifically in the second quarter will depend on where rates come out and then beyond that well still obviously were going through ccar but we still should have capacity to figure out what we want to do with the excess capital that the company generate michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and as earnings capacity grows as nii grows then we go through the year and we execute on our efficiency program theres and were still operating under the asset cap you theres i think youll see us be prudent but weve got plenty of flexibility as we look through the rest of the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for taking my questions operator the next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open sir ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning hey just a couple follow ups on the cost side so mike the business sales from last year and kind of the stranded costs and the transition agreements can you walk us through again how much of that was in the first quarter and then how does that kind of decline and is that also built into your full year expectation for the cost numbers michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 yeah so what we said ken as you look at the first quarter its about million of expenses fell away in the quarter as the indiscernible business exited and the remainder and so about million of that was from the ongoing run rate of businesses about million was a charge we took last year for the student loan business but and the remainder falls either under the tsas which are in place today and likely run most of the year if not into early next year but remember theres revenue on the other side of that and then you have the stranded cost so the numbers we laid out at the end of the fourth quarter last year havent changed and as the tsas rolloff well do our best to highlight that if its meaningful and then were going to continue to work on the stranded cost and get them out but thatll take a little bit of time as we said last quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay and then just two little things on net interest income you did mention that you had the epbo sales this quarter and i think related lower net interest income plus you did show the decline in premium and im wondering if you can just help us understand how much the epbo sales took out of nii and are you still expecting those to go out through the year and how do you expect ph premium m to trend from here thanks mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and the combo of ppp loans and epbos came down sequentially or linked quarter about million and that was the impact on revenue there and nii so and well reiterate that in the q when it comes out as you look at ph premium m for mortgagebacked you can look at the slide for reference when you have time i know its a busy day today but it came down roughly little over million million million decline in the quarter and that will continue to decline as prepaids slow throughout the year so its come down quite a bit since where we were last year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks mike operator thank you the next question comes from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah hi mike just on the fee income front you made a couple comments already about the core fee lines what about some of the more ph volatile lines on the capital market side i think the venture capital came in a little bit betterthanexpected in a tough market this quarter what should we be thinking about in terms of investment banking trading and maybe the norwest venture line michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah as you know predicting investment banking fees and market fees is fought with lots of issues but i think look its clear that on the investment banking side some of the capital markets particularly on the equity side has slowed quite a bit this year given some of the volatility weve seen our pipeline really hasnt changed much its still pretty strong for where we stand coming into the quarter and so some of that realization of that pipeline is just wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 somewhat market dependent and dependent on indiscernible deals the timing of some of the deals closing so well see the market revenue markets revenue is somewhat dependent on the volatility that we see and the demand we see and so i think as others have gone through this we will benefit from some of that as we go through it but its hard to predict exactly where well end up and then on norwest venture like if you go back a number of years and you look at theres some number theres some like stability to that line when you look at over the last three four years i think when you look at some of what happened this quarter we did have a bunch of realized like business being sold or going public in one or two cases of some of the investments and so that was really good to see that thats still continuing despite some of the market volatility and i think well see how it goes i think we wont its hard to imagine well see some of the peaks that we saw last yearin that revenue line item but i do expect well continue to see some good performance across those businesses john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and also on the nii any comments you could make about your expectations for the cadence of the nii improvement throughout the year and maybe a little bit of what youre baking in on ph premium m and maybe how much benefit you get from on a spot basis like a hike of or bps just any framework there thanks michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no so a lot of its going to be dependent on how fast the fed moves and as you know as when the fed moves the impact of that is immediate you start realizing that the day after and so obviously those expectations there have changed quite a bit so thatll be the case i think in the q we give you the shock the numbers on basis point moves and those are pretty close to what you should expect for the first few rate rises in terms of the impact and again its pretty immediate for indiscernible john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and the ph premium m mike you assume that did that comes down throughout the year michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah it has to yeah i mean absolutely itll continue to come down as we see rates go up and prepaids slow sorry about that but yeah i think youll start to see that come down i think itll be its a little bit dependent upon again how things progress but its not unreasonable to think as we look out the next quarter that its somewhere in the ballpark of what we saw from on a linkedquarter basis this quarter john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it i guess i was wondering did you improve the assumptions for that is that part of the nii upgrade or is that more just rates kind of okay michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 yeah thats baked into the increase in nii that we gave john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess first question charlie youve in the past talked about the rotce as needing the asset cap to lift and some level of higher rates beginning a lot more in terms of higher rates than we expected six months ago just doing rough math in terms of how we talked about expense outlook midteens nii growth do you think its conceivable that we hit rotce at some point over the next four to six quarters even without the asset cap being lifted charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i dont want to talk about a timeframe yet because i think what weve consistently said and well stick to that is well get to and then well talk a little bit more about the and try and hone a little bit more on timing but i do think it is fair to assume that the rate rises that were seeing are more than we would have thought was necessary to get to but so i think the question of the asset cap not still being with us i think that is the reality and so its quite possible that the rate rises will be more of a benefit than we would have hoped in terms of offsetting that but i think we should just wait until we get to but certainly these rate rises that were seeing and the asset sensitivity that we have are certainly a meaningful positive for us and more than we would have expected ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc appreciate that response and just one quick question on credit mike when we think about another quarter of sizable reserve release weve seen one of your peers yesterday build reserves talking about just putting a higher weight on a stress case scenario give us a sense in terms of your outlook for the economy and how that leads to loan loss reserves where they are today versus i think your day one cecl was about basis points just any thought process around how youre thinking through that would be helpful charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co this is charlie ill take a stab at it first i think its i think understanding whats in our cecl assumptions is something which is important as hard as it is to predict it does give you a sense for how were thinking about things and how our loan book and other items play out in that reserve and calculation but it is very hard to compare across companies because we have different scenarios we put different probabilities on different things and the way you know the conservatism in models is different across companies i think what weve seen consistently in our reserving levels is weve been on the more conservative side relative to others that might just be a view of a more conservative set of assumptions or something which is embedded in our models or the way we think about just the potential impacts of covid and now the potential impacts of a slowing economy so i would say overall i dont sitting here today if you were to look at our the way we look at the assumptions that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 go into it i think we were already assuming a reasonable percentage of probability on the downsides and so that hasnt changed but we feel better about some of the assumptions weve made relative to covid and weve added some assumptions relative to inflation so i think net net net thats what drives the reduction in terms of where we are and i still think we feel very comfortable and hopefully youre at the more conservative end of what can come out of a cecl calculation ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and should we then still assume that the reserves probably track lower over the next few quarters at least absent the big change in the macro charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think its all dependent on the macro at this point ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co you know cecl requires you to take a look at based up on what the the full amount of the losses embedded in the portfolio relative to what you see is the macroeconomic outlook and the specific performance though by outlook it gets better reserves will come down if it gets worse it will go up and if it stays the same itll be along there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you for taking my questions operator thank you the next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had another semitechnical question here but on the nii outlook i get your point that you should see improvement pretty nearterm from the rate environment im just thinking about what you put in your release for the yields on loans where at least this quarter loan yields came down a bit now i know part of that is probably wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 day count but we saw some declines in resi mortgage on first and second lien and also on the auto side and i just wanted to get a sense and also in ci right so i just wanted to get a sense what was playing into that q onq and then how quickly that could revert as we go through this year michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah hey betsy its mike ill try to take a shot at that i think on the resi mortgage side what youre seeing is the impact of the epbo loans and so they are coming the impact of those coming down so that creates a little bit of noise i think there relative to the yield there if you look at rest on the ci book im going to get directionally the percentage but call it twothirds of the ci book in that neighborhood is floating rate maybe plus or minus a little bit there but that starts to react pretty obviously direct pretty quickly to rates moving and in any given quarter youll see a little bit of noise on that yield but youll start to see that react as rates go up betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay its not like its hedged out and thats why we saw what we saw michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co no betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the other message im getting from you this morning is that this rate improvement youre expecting to drop to the bottomline is that fair michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well i think we reiterated our expense guidance for the year and nii is going to be a lot better charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co betsy whats in your question im not sure i understand just to make sure were answering indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc well youre getting an uptick in rate and given the fact that your guidance on expenses is holding steady it seems like youre going to drop all that rate hike to the bottomline charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well i mean yes were going to make more money on nii mike went through the specifics on how noninterest income will likely come down but not obviously not nearly as much as the benefit that well get as you look out wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 over nii and chargeoffs still will remain at low levels for the foreseeable future even though those will go up at some point and yes expenses will continue to come down for us to meet that billion number so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right yeah i mean it feels like its at least a midsingles uptick on consensus eps thats what it feels like to me at least but i mean i know if i drop all the nii to the bottomline i get something closer to a highsingles uptick on consensus eps but charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co indiscernible just make sure you look at if i tried to layout a little bit of whats going to happen on non interest income and again chargeoffs are at all times lows you see the delinquency numbers so unless theres something on the commercial side or the wholesale side that were not aware of its we feel and we talk about how we feel i think its the economy is the economy we are positioned well for this kind of environment but we also think people should just make sure that they are conscious of the movement in all the line items betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then on the customer remediation charge that you took this quarter i guess thats the other kind of question that ive been getting is its onetimey but it feels like its happened a lot so how much more is left charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co its really hard to answer and i understand the frustration and i would say every quarter we go through this we say we want to make sure that weve got everything but we have to make sure that when we look at these remediations theyre aligned with what makes sense for the customer and that weve captured all the portfolios and some of these remediations require us to go back and recreate a scenario from years ago and so thats part of the complication that indiscernible and so were not going to say that theres no more but they are very casespecific and at some point they will be behind us but we have to do what we have to do and at least in the big scheme of things relative to the benefits that well see from things like nii these arent overwhelming and we understand how this fits into the guidance that weve given on full year expenses betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay thank you operator and the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i guess just following up on the regulatory line of questions and as usual i got to ask some questions that are tough to answer but look youve acknowledged youre making significant progress the regulators have acknowledged youre making significant progress the fundamentals are clearly moving in the right direction in a meaningful way but in the prepared remarks you still say you need to continue to close these gaps over the next several years and i guess the question is like is this just cautionary language or are there still things that you are wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 implementing on kind of a daily and ongoing basis to address some of the legacy issues i guess i thought you had implemented kind of the fixes and its kind of at the oversight and execution situation but maybe you could just talk to that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i dont recall saying the words that you just used i think we have been try to be very clear that we have a lot of ongoing work to do that we feel very good about the frameworks that we have in place but we are as you once you develop the framework the implementation of the frameworks that takes a significant amount of time we continue to do that and as we develop stronger controls inside the company we will potentially find things that then have to get fixed and remediated because this is many years of work that were doing at this point and as the regulators look at the amount of time that it takes to do it at the things that we find as we put these controls in place and just some of these legacy things that continue to remain out there i just think its prudent that we expect to have things i think we say its possible or likely but if theres something specific we would say it but i think it is thats just thats the reality of the situation that were on and so it is where we find ourselves is and ill speak for ourselves not the regulators we have made significant progress from where we were when we got here but theres still a significant amount of more work to do matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just a follow up on a different topic and apologies if i missed it but you did talk about slowing buybacks in the second quarter partly raised partly loans and obviously youve got back a lot this quarter did you give the magnitude that you expect to buyback or remind us your targeted capital at least until the next ccar comes out thank you michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah matt ill take that as weve said a few times in the past we plan to run the cet1 ratio at somewhere between and basis points over our reg minimum which right now is and i think as we look forward given the way the framework works is well have plenty of flexibility to do what we thinks prudent on buybacks as we go throughout the rest of the year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you the next question comes from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my questions have been asked and answered thank you michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co thank you wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks erika operator thank you the next question will come from charles peabody of portales partners your line is open charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut yeah most of my questions have been asked but let me ask one question about how you manage your mortgage banking operation because youre one of the few large banks that still has a relatively balanced origination and servicing sides historically servicing was kind of viewed as a balance to origination when originations didnt do well servicing would do well but that hasnt been the case recently in your recent history and so can you talk about how youre managing it and why there isnt a balance to those two pieces charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah ill start this is charlie mike and then you can pipe in i think we think about our mortgage business in the context of the whole company not as a separate independent entity that has to stand by itself and so when we think about the interest rate risk position of the entire company thats where we think about what potentially happens on the production side versus what happens in the msr the management of the msr is difficult its got some very different types of risks embedded in it and all you did was look at those two as offsets you could be kidding yourselves as to what the value of the servicing is and so as i said net net net when we look at the position of the company i would look at the reduction of mortgage banking income not being offset by the msr but being offset by the rest of the benefit that well get as a company nii charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut and just as a follow up when you gave guidance about a material stepdown in mortgage banking in the second quarter were you talking strictly on the origination side or as a whole entity michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co as a whole think of the mortgage banking income line as what we were referring to charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and remember included in there is the fact that the msr is fairly wellhedged so its basically its the whole but its also whats really driving it is origination operator thank you our final question for today will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets you may go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 thank you good morning charlie and mike you both referenced in your comments about the excess capacity in mortgage banking and youre anticipating waiting for some of that excess capacity to come out as originations of course for the industry have come down to higher rates what are some of the metrics you guys are monitoring keeping an eye on to show you that that capacity is coming out of the system michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well i think as you thinking about the industry as a whole so its hard gerard to look at any specific metrics per se but i think where youre going to see that first is likely a gain on sale margins as people start as those start to normalize as excess capacity comes out all right so i think thats one of the areas i would look at charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and listen i mean people just everyone in the industry looks around at the amount of volume being down substantially they look at the amount of expense that they have people then rationalize the expense that they have and that naturally changes the competitive dynamics about where people are pricing so were focused on making sure that weve got the right level of expense relative to the revenue and volume that were seeing and thats exactly what everyone else does gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and mike just following up on your gain on the sale of margins what would you consider normal and where are they for you guys today michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well we dont disclose the margin itself as you sort of look forward but normal varies right as you sort of look through the cycle in the mortgage business and so i think were certainly if you start thinking about primary secondary spreads thats one indicator of sort of where gain on sale margins will go i think and were now back to what is likely more historical levels right around basis points or so when you look at that and thats so i think youre kind of back to a more normal level there and then i think as excess capacity goes out like youll start to see the gain on sale come back up i think its hard to say exactly what normal will look like there as we go through the cycle gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just as a followup question mike you alluded to the possibility that the stress capital buffer following this years ccar could be a little higher for you folks is there can you give us some color what is making you think that way michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co its just the severity of the variables that went into it gerard and obviously its a bit of a black box in terms of what exactly the answer is and so we do our best to try to look at like how that might impact us and how the fed might look at it but its really based on the severity of the scenario that play through wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great always appreciate the color thank you michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co appreciate it michael santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co and i think thats the last question so we know its a really busy day for everyone so we thank you for
