head of investor relations and im joined today by our cochairman and ceo walt bettinger president rick wurster and cfo peter crawford as you saw on the earnings today we had a nice strong start to the year theres plenty to cover today but before jumping in lets quickly cover off a few of the typical housekeeping items the slides for todays business update will be posted to our website at the start of peters remarks qa is still one question no followup and lets try to limit the six and sevenpart questions if possible of course we always encourage you to jump back in the queue if additional questions come to mind and as always please dont hesitate to contact the schwab ir team regarding any clarifying or some of the more tactical questions and finally the everpresent wallboards that showcases our forwardlooking statements and reminds us that the future is indeed uncertain so please stay up todate with our disclosures and with that ill turn it over to walt walter w bettinger ii cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 thank you jeff and good morning everyone thanks for joining us for our april business update so we begin welcoming the majority of our employees back to the office last october and as a result i began traveling the country hosting townhalls and roundtables to meet many of the employees who had joined us both before or during the pandemic and hear from them in addition i shared some of my perspectives on the economic environment the strength of the schwab franchise and my confidence for the future after having lived and worked through many economic cycles i shared with our people that right when things often seen the darkest they tend to turn around and begin to appear brighter of course i didnt know last fall just how accurate that would turn out to be its a wonderful lesson in not overreacting to things that are outside our control as i sit here today and of course recognizing that there are certain environmental and geopolitical risks that remain the green shoots of a turnaround in the environment are appearing and were seeing it positively impacting virtually every area at schwab from investor engagement to net new assets to client cash realigning to capital building and of course to revenue and earnings combined with the timelessness of our through clients eyes strategy and the hard work of our incredible team of schwab employees my optimism for the future is strong of course we didnt simply wait around and wait for a better environment our teams have been hard at work on key areas like the ameritrade integration enhancing our digital capabilities and platforms and delivering the worldclass level of service our clients have grown to trust and expect from us so lets go ahead and dig into the first quarter of the year inflation remained at relatively moderate levels during the quarter down substantially from just over a year or two ago and even as the market reduced expectations for the pace and extent of fed easing due to the stubborn inflation readings the equity markets continued to move higher during the quarter investor sentiment continued its recovery with the bull bear spread maintaining its recent strong position and not surprisingly traders also began to become more active for our schwab trading index or stax looking for opportunities to benefit from the improving overall sentiment and encouraged by the improving environment our clients became even more engaged in the markets with daily average trades up over the prior quarter client borrowing or margin balances up in one quarter alone total client interactions with schwab were up and as they engaged more they also took the opportunity to seek our help more often with net flows into our investment advisory solutions up almost quarteroverquarter all these metrics reinforce the confidence our clients have in us and each of them provides support for our optimistic view of the future and as we progressed through the quarter we were gratified to see a resumption in the strong organic growth weve been able to produce for many decades highlighted by core net new assets for the quarter just shy of billion and with the month of march particularly encouraging with about billion of core nna and thats a annualized growth rate new brokerage accounts also grew to over million in the quarter and thats the first time that weve exceeded million since the initial quarter of last year our progress in net new assets during the quarter was due at least in part to a slowing of the level of expected asset attrition from the ameritrade integration although we continue to expect to see some degree of attrition throughout the balance of this year overall attrition from former ameritrade clients continues to moderate and remains below the levels that we anticipated when we announced the acquisition in late a major factor in the following attrition is of course that clients become accustomed to the schwab platform as well as they recognize that many of the prior ameritrade platform features we have built into the schwab platforms ill go ahead and share a little bit more around the details of how former ameritrade retail clients are responding postconversion in terms of their promoter scores when i move to the next slide the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 so speaking of retail client promoter scores we achieved record levels as measured in the first quarter our overall score was and interestingly with our premier feebased advisory solution schwab wealth advisory which some of you may know by its former name of schwab private client it reached a promoter score of i think whats particularly interesting here is that we achieved this lofty score in a solution where clients are paying fees for our advice and guidance its clearly a reflection of just how far we have come at schwab from our roots as purely a discount broker and the appreciation our clients have for the investments weve made in building our modern wealth management capabilities of course we still offer worldclass service for selfdirected investors and an incredible value for fee conscious investors but the diversification of our model is building now as i mentioned earlier were also tracking our promoter scores for former ameritrade retail clients who converted over to the schwab platform and what we see there is an initial dip in those scores probably to be expected given the changes that they face they have to learn a new mobile app a new website and the like but over a fairly short period of time their scores begin trending toward our historic scores for schwab clients days post conversion their scores increase on average about points and after nine months their scores have improved about points i think these results are another testament to the quality of integration and conversion work thats been done by our dedicated people whove been working on the ameritrade conversion and while mentioning the strength of our offerings for our retail investors we continue to be recognized by independent third parties for the quality of our platform and service i do want to call out a special mention of the success were achieving in our 401k and defined contribution business that operates under our workplace financial services arm the premier evaluation of service providers in that industry is done by plansponsor magazine and they again recognized schwab with the highest number of bestinclass awards for the seventh consecutive year and thats more than two times the number of bestinclass awards compared to the second place finisher a relatively remarkable run of recognition in a challenging business line where bigger is often mistaken as better and then lastly from a thirdparty recognition standpoint we were honored when jd power named ameritrade and schwab as number one and number two in their satisfaction survey for selfdirected investors ameritrades number one ranking reflects the highest they have ever scored and it was clearly aided by the multiple schwab enhancements that weve made to the client experience for ameritrade users a couple of those being the addition of our schwab security guarantee and a substantial reduction in the speed to answer client phone calls i think this recognition illustrates the power of the combined platforms and our decision as part of the integration to go with the best of both in design i understand that this approach added some time to our integration efforts but im confident it will pay dividends for years to come and before i turn it over to rick id like to spend just a moment commenting on the final client transition group that is planned to convert over to schwab next month as well as maybe summarize the overall ameritrade integration next month well convert the last of ameritrade client accounts and assets but this group is incredibly important and its also unique its made up of our most active traders and many are power users of the thinkorswim platform for these clients the conversion experience should go relatively smoothly because unlike the prior four transition groups for this group the client experience is essentially unchanged theyll continue to have access to the trading platform tos that they have historically utilized while also adding all of the features and benefits of schwab in terms of their clients in the overall integration effort and as largely expected after initial settling in period clients in our transition groups are engaging with schwab and the expanded array of capabilities we offer these clients are now beginning to bring new assets to us and their trading volumes now exceed the levels of trading they were doing preconversion when they were exclusively at ameritrade and were not saying that all integration the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 related asset attrition is over just yet but as weve shared previously when all is said and done we expect to have performed in line or even better than the levels of client asset and revenue attrition that we projected when we announced the acquisition in late in my opinion the combination of the best of ameritrade with the best of schwab sets the bar for anyone serving retail investors and independent investment advisors alike our combination of platform service dedicated relationships investment advisory for retail clients and expertise serving independent investment advisors is a powerful combination for driving future growth so rick let me turn it over to you for some more discussion on our efforts and results during the first quarter richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thanks walt and hello everyone were coming out of the first quarter with strong momentum in our four strategic priority areas as we continue to focus on driving scale and efficiency winwin monetization meeting the personalized needs of our client segments and delivering brilliantly on the basics that our clients expect let me start with scale and efficiency scale and efficiency has been a key enabler of our success and our ability to disrupt the industry looking back to expense per account has come down in inflationadjusted terms weve cut the expense to serve an account roughly in half at the same time as you can see on the righthand side of the page we have an expense advantage against our competitors this means more of our clients wealth is working towards meeting their goals this is a hallmark of our business model and a driver of the virtuous cycle because it means we can reinvest back in our clients over time with our consistent focus on expense discipline and scale combined the synergies from the ameritrade conversion and continuously improving our operations we are able to drive down costs as we look forward well fully realize our planned synergies from the ameritrade integration and well invest in ai well invest in endtoend process transformation and well invest in technology enhancements to add to our expense advantage while making sure we continue to deliver a no tradeoffs experience to clients enhancing our wealth and lending offerings remains an important winwin monetization opportunity we are making progress on both fronts our clients continue to seek out our advisory solutions in record numbers and we have made a number of important advancements in our lending capabilities which clients have really appreciated in the first quarter we saw a record billion in net flows into our advisory solutions a increase over last year we have seen continued interest in our flagship wealth offering schwab wealth advisory along with increased interest in wasmer and schwab personalized indexing schwab wealth advisory attracted a record billion in net flows for the first quarter with approximately of those enrollments coming from legacy ameritrade households which to us demonstrates the power of the opportunity ahead of us as we introduce more ameritrade clients to the breadth of all we have to offer demand for our wasmer schroeder fixed income strategies continues to be strong with billion of net flows which is up over last year and as walt highlighted earlier the clients in these wealth offers are our happiest clients at schwab these solutions consistently achieve our highest client promoter scores as we look forward we are investing to add capabilities to our wealth and advice platform to support our accelerated growth the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 turning now to client segmentation while we will always meet the needs of this full spectrum of investors we continue to provide tailored offers for specific client segments the specialized experiences we recently launched for retail highnetworth clients which we call schwab private client services and schwab private wealth services are just two examples our highnetworth and ultrahighnetworth client segments are among the fastest growing at schwab and they represent approximately three quarters of our total retail client assets today and the specialized service models that we launched last year are serving these clients well in the first quarter the teams serving these clients answered calls on average in less than seconds and of the calls were resolved by the rep who first answered the phone without needing to transfer the client to another rep or group we are adding to our product and advice capabilities for these clients with the anticipated rollout this year of an alternatives platform for retail investors weve also launched our investor advantage pricing for clients and are working on additional lending capabilities to meet this client segments needs were also continuing to invest to provide a trader client experience that is unparalleled in our industry with our schwab trading powered by ameritrade offer in the first quarter we saw robust trading activity across the board including strong continued engagement from our ameritrade clients traders at schwab have access to the thinkorswim trading platforms as well as specialized service teams and tailored education for traders of all levels of expertise and sophistication and this is an area that we continue to invest in to maintain and expand our advantage we doubled the number of schwab households this quarter they use thinkorswim we believe that our trading offer has never been stronger in terms of our execution our platform our service and the combined research that we offer to our clients through the research and educational capabilities of both schwab and ameritrade turning now to brilliant basics we want to delight our clients with exceptional experiences in every interaction they have with us that schwab and we want to be the easiest place in the industry for our clients to do business this means that were continuing to make investments to enhance the investor experience for all of our clients this includes digital interactions like our streamlined digital onboarding for rias where they can now open and fund multiple accounts in just minutes or in our enhanced pledged asset line process where we can now process a pledged asset line in just minutes for most loans for the pledged asset line the client experience is usually a conversation with their fc or their ria to discuss the product to discuss the rate and what assets theyd like to pledge clients then get a docusign email asking them to sign to apply for the loan the time from that email to the email that says the line open and is ready to draw is just about to minutes the feedback from our clients on this process has been off the charts we have also worked hard in our digital experiences to be as welcoming as possible to ameritrade clients by incorporating the features and functionality thats of greatest importance to them weve also enhanced our move money and selfservice capabilities and incorporated docusign into our commonly used forms and it also means were providing access and intuitive experiences when and where our clients want to engage with us whether thats in one of our branches whether its on the phone where clients can expect their calls to be answered in less than a minute or whether its online through our schwab intelligent assistant with through clients eyes as our foundation investors continue to turn to us to serve their wealth management and investing needs through all market cycles we are both ready for the final ameritrade conversion group and ready to push forward on our four strategic focus areas to serve our clients we believe we are wellpositioned to meet the evolving needs of clients and deliver organic growth in line with our historical levels the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 and with that ill turn it over peter peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp thank you very much rick so you all heard walt and rick talk about our increasing momentum in the market driven by our no tradeoff positioning and the satisfaction and loyalty of our existing clients the significant progress weve made with the ameritrade integration and the success were having as training to unlock the substantial opportunities the combination enables and our progress and plans around our four strategic priorities which were confident will allow us to continue growing with both our existing clients and new to firm in my time today ill review our solid first quarter financial performance ill provide an update on some of the key factors influencing our nearterm story and ill share some highlevel thoughts on the rest of though recognizing that its still early in the year so we wont be sharing updated mathematical illustrations until july the important point is that we sit here today one year removed from the events surrounding the regional banking crisis we are in a very strong position with nearly all key business and financial indicators improving in some cases substantially weve seen meaningful progress back towards our historical pace of organic growth a continued moderation of client cash realignment activity with the pace slowing in fact even faster than our expectations a further reduction in the usage of supplemental borrowing revenue and earnings that have bounced up from the prior quarter with much more room to grow throughout this year and beyond continued expense discipline with head count down modestly from yearend and a full lower from the year ago levels and finally a continued increase in our capital levels both our regulatory levels and those inclusive of aoci now back in january walt and i both said that is likely to be somewhat of a transitional year from a financial standpoint but one with steadily improving financial results that bridge from what proved to be a challenging to what we believe is a very promising future ahead one quarter of the way through the year that transition is well on its way as our core earnings power is becoming less obscured by some of the nearterm headwinds and our longterm financial formula that youre all familiar with growth in the client franchise driving scale in the business leading to improving financials and ultimately capital return reenters the picture as walt mentioned the first quarter has been characterized by a supportive macro backdrop increased engagement and solid organic growth we saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the sp as well as key drivers of our business performance including trading activity up from the fourth quarter of and margin balances up sequentially as well that constructive foundation paved the way for our financial performance to improve significantly from the fourth quarter with billion of revenue driven by a sequential increase in net interest revenue and a record billion of asset management and admin fees an adjusted pre tax margin of roughly up nearly basis points sequentially and adjusted eps of up from the prior quarter a demonstration of the leverage our model provides as the headwinds weve been facing begin to abate now turning our attention to the balance sheet total assets dropped by driven by the paydown of parent level debt and the continuation albeit at a much slower pace of the client cash realignment activity we have experienced roughly two years we saw notable reduction in activity from january to february and march and the overall level of realignment in the quarter was more than less than the same quarter in and within the bank was an amount that we could support with a cash flow from the investment portfolio and that allowed us to reduce our usage of supplemental borrowing by nearly billion during the quarter bringing the total down roughly billion from the peak last may the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 and finally despite increasing rates during the quarter our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated tier leverage ratio rising to and our adjusted tier leverage ratio inclusive of aoci and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the aoci optout and schwab bank now at meaning that were now above what will likely be the new wellcapitalized standard at our banks over four years ahead of the earliest anticipated implementation date and during last quarters update we talked about the slowing pace of client cash realignment but we also shared our expectation that wed likely to see some typical seasonal activity to start the year and thats indeed been the case and while clients continue to engage in the market both a number of newer realigners and the size of those realignment events continue to trend lower bringing us ever closer to the point where any residual activity among existing clients will be more than offset by the contribution of cash from new accounts and making client cash realignment a story that were optimistic will soon move to the back pages now as we turn our attention from the solid quarter we just completed to what we expect to be a very bright future we expect our net interest margin to expand through and and approach by the end of driven mostly by the paydown of supplemental borrowing now the actual pace of paying off that borrowing will be influenced of course by the level of deposit growth but also by the growth of margin balances and why is that now given the way that the liquidity ratio where lcr rule works for every dollar of margin balance growth we need an extra roughly of client cash of the broker dealers and that requires us to reroute some client cash balances from bank sweep to the broker dealer cash solution and those are balances that wed otherwise have used to pay down the supplemental borrowing but i want to be very clear that increased margin loans expand both our net interest margin and our net interest revenue we are happy to carry some of these supplemental borrowings at roughly 5ish percent to support lending activity that currently generates closer to now on the expense side we continue to maintain spending discipline with the objective of flattish expenses yearoveryear even as we have grown accounts and assets during the quarter average head count dropped roughly from the fourth quarter and is down nearly yearoveryear but of course the ultimate path of expenses will depend to a certain extent on some volume related factors such as trading and equity market valuations which of course correspond to revenue and finally we continue to expect strong growth in revenue and earnings through the year with an exit velocity in the fourth quarter substantially higher than where we are today and the potential for continued sequential growth in and beyond now one final but important point i would make the longterm nim expectation i communicated is based off a dot plot forecast from a few weeks ago an anticipation that wed see interest rates come down in the coming years and to the extent those rates stay higher for longer that is a good thing for our business we are asset sensitive a continuation of higher rates means higher yields on a little bit more than onethird of our assets that are floating margin loans our pledged asset lines cash et cetera and potentially more time for us to capitalize on higher rates once we resume our investment activity following the paydown of our supplement borrowing so again if we dont see basis points of easing by the end of as the fed suggested a few weeks ago our net interest margin could actually exceed that figure above all else being equal and finally despite longterm rates that moved higher during the quarter our capital ratios have continued to grow with our banks now all measurably above the wellcapitalized level even if aoci is included and we continue to expect our consolidated adjusted tier leverage ratio to reach the upper range by the end of at which point well be in a position to at least consider potential options for resuming further capital return and that paves the way for return to our longterm financial formula one that combines our position as the premier asset gatherer in our industry with a track record of consistent to organic growth through the cycle industry leading client the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 loyalty a leadership position in the two fastest growing segments within wealth management and significant opportunity in front of us our diversified revenue model allowing us to convert asset growth into revenue growth with contributions from net interest revenue asset management fees and trading and over the next several years a major tailwind in the form of nim expansion a focus on disciplined expense management highlighted by a recognition that our low cost structure is a big competitive advantage as rick talked about and a scalable business model that enables both margin expansion over time and investments to continue to grow the business and a business model that can combine that strong organic growth and revenue growth with more meaningful capital return as our capital levels inclusive of aoci are much higher this is a formula that has worked in the past and is every bit as relevant today as ever with that ill turn it over to jeff to facilitate our qa jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp operator can you please check the queue and see if we have any questions question and answer section operator yes thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ken worthington with jpmorgan you may go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning and thanks for taking the question you paid down billion of federal home loan bank borrowing billion of cds this quarter so billion in total is this the pace of borrowing paydown that you would expect for the next couple of quarters and to what extent are the higher markets and greater asset levels and the solid volume helping to boost the pace of payback versus your initial expectations peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah ken so were certainly our priority is to pay down the supplemental borrowings both the cds and the fhlb as quickly as we possibly can and the pace of paying that down is really driven by as i mentioned in my comments both the levels of transactional cash that we see as well as the mix of that transactional cash between the bank and the broker dealer so well do it as quickly as we can to the extent that we see greater contributions from new accounts and a greater level of deposit growth that will accelerate that in terms of the market engagement and the strong markets its really sort of two forces going on there when markets are higher and moving higher we do see clients more likely to change their asset allocation and move into the equity markets and that ends up being a negative for some of that cash on the other hand when markets are higher clients are more engaged and so theyre more likely to add to their accounts with money from outside of schwab and so thats certainly a positive for us as well operator thank you our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research you may go ahead the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to ask a question on the sweep cash growth algorithm just given sorting is in the very late innings the second derivative on sweep cash is steadily improving i was hoping you could speak to the proportion of new cash dollars that are getting deployed into money market versus bank sweep and how that informs the expectations for when sweep deposits could not only stabilize but actually begin to inflect positively peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so steven i would say that when you look at the new accounts they tend to over time look a lot like the existing accounts they come in with a heavier portion of cash and then but we are seeing some of the new accounts kind of realigning ahead of bringing that money that business to schwab one of the things we saw in this last quarter for example is we saw that our transferred accounts dollars were actually a higher portion of our net new assets than theyve been for last year that is a good thing i mean that means we are winning business from competitors clients are entrusting us and choosing to shift more of their business to schwab versus our competitors but that also means that some of that net new asset is coming in the form of securities and mutual funds et cetera so it really depends our expectation of course is we will see that the realignment among the existing clients continue to moderate not necessarily go to zero but continue to moderate and then get offset by as we see growth from contribution of cash from new accounts over time and well see a resumption of deposit growth and over time our transactional cash will grow with the growth in accounts and the growth of our total assets operator thank you our next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs you may go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning thank you for the question as well could you guys expand a little bit more on the capital return priorities as you make your way back to higher capital ratios as you pointed out over the last couple quarters would the preference be to a larger buyback maybe kind of how we saw in the past or something else thanks peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah thanks alex so certainly capital return remains a very important part of our financial formula weve obviously paused our buyback at the moment to enable us to more quickly grow into what we expect will be our new capital requirements but our baseline forecast anticipates that our capital level is growing inclusive of aoci growing to the levels that we had excluding aoci previously and at that point we expect to be in a position to at least consider as i mentioned returning more capital to our stockholders again its not weve always said our buyback is opportunistic not programmatic not automatic and in terms of our capital return priorities we always consider a few different things we look of course at our dividend which tends to grow with the growth in earnings we look at doing common buybacks and then of course we also look at preferred redemptions as well and we want to look at the full landscape i guess if you will and also take into consideration as we do so the interest rate environment what were seeing from clients the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 the level of supplemental borrowing we have outstanding and so forth but those are all the different aspects the different vehicles that we consider as we think about capital return but again the capital return indiscernible is a very very important part of our financial formula and something we think is as you look over time will continue to be very very important for the company jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp hi operator we have a few questions that have kind of trickled in over the course of the day on the console here so maybe lets insert one maybe this one is for walt recognizing this is a bit of a topic du jour across most industries could you spend a minute talking about the role of ai or artificial intelligence in schwabs goforward strategy walter w bettinger ii a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thanks jeff youre right theres an incredible amount of hype that you have to sort through here but we do believe that ai has a lot of longterm potential for us in making a difference in serving our various client segments i think for us it can really impact the efficiency of service as well as enhance digital experiences for our clients at the same time we tend to believe that it will be the marriage of ai with humans that will deliver best for our clients of course we have been very active in the use of ai for things like security and fraud detection for a number of years and of course the challenges there as its also being leveraged by bad actors so theres a constant effort to stay a couple of steps ahead there from a security and fraud detection i think from a productivity and efficiency standpoint big opportunities are there and a very simple example is take the difference between someone answering a client call who has a year of experience versus some of that has years of experience that gap today even with access to our knowledge center capability likely exist just given the difference in tenure and experience i would expect that gap to close dramatically given some of the projects and initiatives that we have going on with ai today that will provide realtime knowledge support for all of our reps when you switch over to something like generative ai i think its going to be a while to watch that technology mature i know that may not match some of the hype that we hear some speaking of but i think that technology will need to mature there will be a lot of work that will go on with regulators along the way to ensure that we can deliver for clients without some of the inherent biases that you sometimes see but ai is a big big opportunity for us to further delight our clients to deliver on the brand basics that rick spoke of and continue to ensure fairness and transparency and accountability with ai usage as we navigate the opportunities that will be present there operator thank you and our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs you may go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question given that today is april and we have our taxes due hoping that you could give us an update around what trends youve seen around tax payments month todate and maybe an early read on how this tax season compares with other tax seasons you see peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 sure brennan so were still not all the way obviously through the tax season but i would say on the whole this tax season is proceeding generally speaking consistent with our expectations it looks a lot more like tax seasons from years prior to and with more of our clients cash being in money funds a lot more of the tax payments are being paid by through redemption of those money funds again not surprisingly so overall consistent with what weve seen and again in previous years before and operator thank you our next question comes from devin ryan with the citizens jmp you may go ahead devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities thanks so much yeah good morning so you guys have about billion more in money market balances today than you guys did at the beginning of when the fed policy shifted so if the path of interest rates is lower from here how sticky are those balances and do you think your money flowing out of money market funds over time is that a net opportunity for schwab or is a drag i guess it would just seem to matter where some of that money would flow so just great to get an update there given how large those balances are today thanks peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yes so i guess i would want to split that into two pieces youre right so obviously balances and money funds are certainly a lot higher today than they were a few years ago and obviously higher than when we were in the zero interest rate environment to the extent that money so it depends on where that money is flowing out of money funds if its flowing out of money funds into the equity markets into mutual funds et cetera of course it depends on what the vehicle is if its flowing out of money funds into cash on our balance sheet then clearly thats a positive for us from a revenue standpoint what id say is that if interest our expectation is that interest rates fall modestly under basis points or something like that over time youd see a little bit of a shift in the proportion of cash thats sitting in those transactional cash solutions like bank sweep and the broker dealer cash solution versus money funds its not going to happen immediately its not like people would sell their money funds when rates fall by basis points but what happens is if they liquidate if they need cash they may sell a money fund and if they want to if a cash accumulates than maybe on the margin somewhat less likely to put that into a money fund and so over time you see that shift change slightly where you see a much more dramatic impact would be of course if rates fall back to levels that we saw in and that tends to be the period of time where youd see a much more significant reduction or shift from money funds on to transactional cash and the nice thing about that is that is something where in an environment like that where spreads on some of our floating rate assets compress having more of that cash on our balance sheet allows us to offset some or all of that impact so it is sort of a some dry powder if you will that helps mitigate the revenue potential revenue impact from a very low interest rate environment jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp im going to push out one more of those console questions here i think this one is for rick it was great to see the interest from the ameritrade side in terms of enrollments in schwab wealth advisory maybe a little more color about what other advise solutions gravitating towards the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp jeff maybe ill first dive into the wealth solutions that are gravitating towards and just make a comment about the overall integration weve gone through now four transition weekends well have our fifth coming up shortly from an operational standpoint those have gone exceptionally well and as walt shared earlier the more time ameritrade clients spend at schwab the happier theyd become as you see the robust expansion in our client promoter scores were now getting to what i think is the most exciting part of the combination which is the ability to introduce the combined capabilities of our two firms to both sets of clients and weve seen the number of schwab clients that are using thinkorswim we saw those double in the first quarter so our schwab clients are taking advantage of one of the great capabilities of ameritrade which was its trading in educational platform and were seeing the same thing happened for ameritrade clients our wealth platform we think is incredibly strong and weve been able to introduce it to the ameritrade clients through our relationship building and through a different approach to engaging with clients thats holistic and wealth and financial planning oriented and that has led to much greater engagement in wealth solutions among ameritrade clients than in the past in fact weve seen of legacy ameritrade fcs have opened up some form of wealth or advice solution in the first quarter in terms of your specific question what theyre gravitating towards jeff the majority of the assets are going towards fullservice wealth solutions either our schwab wealth advisory capability or schwab advisor network which makes rias available to our clients theyve also gravitated towards schwab personalized indexing and to wasmer schroeder so those would be the four but the majority of flows are going to fullservice wealth and thats exactly the power of the combination that we thought wed see and were seeing it and whats most gratifying about that for us is that on the other end of that is a client whose life were making a big difference in so were excited about these trends operator thank you and our next question is from brian bedell with deutsche bank you may go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks thanks for taking my question maybe just back on the balance sheet peter in relation to the tax season assuming obviously that wed get a contraction in the balance sheet in the month of april just given tax season can you talk a little bit more about investing client risk on behavior investing in assets and then that coming more from the money market funds versus the transactional ph caf and maybe just your confidence that the earning assets could rebuild throughout the year back to levels at the end of march or even potentially exceed that peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah im not sure entirely i guess what id say is i mean just try to answer your question maybe a little bit higher level so without making sot of a specific prediction around where were going to end the year right at back in january we shared those mathematical illustrations steering clear of giving you a specific prediction and the reason we did that is because the actual pace of deposit growth depends on a number of factors that are frankly hard to anticipate right it depends on whats going to happen with interest rates investor sentiments the pace of new account formation and the level of the contribution of cash from those new accounts and those same dynamics are true today as i mentioned our clients in a strong equity market clients tend to be net buyers of equities although the impact is probably not as great as you might think oftentimes i look at the the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 daily flows of into and out equities and oftentimes youll see our clients buying equities on those down days because they end up seeing it as an opportunity to step into the market and buy the dip as it were i think the more significant impact is that at a time when the markets are when clients are feeling more enthusiastic when investor sentiment is higher they do tend to put more money into their accounts both cash as well as they are more engaged in their accounts and what weve seen over time is that when clients are more engaged in the investing process that is a period of time when we tend to win when clients sort of pick up their head and sort of look around and say i want to invest they tend to shop around a little bit more and in those situations we tend to be a winner in terms of business and so that i think is part of the reason that weve seen a very strong transfer of accounts this quarter and were gratified by that and hope that that continues operator thank you our next question is from bill katz with td cowen you may go ahead william katz q analyst td cowen okay thank you very much maybe just to mix up the topics a little bit peter just coming back to expense guide for a moment q1 tends to be rather seasonally strong just given fico and sort of payroll increases et cetera the billion sort of annualize out to just over billion but just given head count reduction yeartodate and seasonal dynamics how should we be thinking about the sort of fullyear bogey right now and the incremental margin on revenues thank you peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so bill well provide an updated expense outlook in our july update as i mentioned in my prepared remarks were targeting flattish expense growth we have definitely taken steps to limit our expenses and have been very disciplined in terms of the hiring and so forth and thats why youve seen our overall labor equivalents come down from the endofyear levels over the course of this year well continue to capture some of the remaining expense synergies related to the ameritrade integration with the expectation that well have fully capture those on a run rate basis by the end of this year im not going to get in sort of exactly a timing around sort of when in the year were going to capture those expense synergies but thats certainly our expectation so were targeting flattish expense growth and as you know bill from following the company for a while there are some expenses that grow and fall with levels of client engagements things like trading theres trading pass through expenses that are aligned with revenue theres thirdparty expenses that go up and down based on equity market valuations theres of course our bonus funding which goes up and down based off of our financial performance so those are a little bit harder to gauge but again if those are going up thats certainly good from a revenue standpoint but our objective right now is and continues to be to be very disciplined on expenses and with the objective of maintaining that at flattish level for the full year jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp another question from the console here this one is from chris obrien at barclays well maybe you could start with this one its a question on retail competitive landscape theres competitors that have been in the market with fairly attractive deposit matches which appear to be driving cash inflows to those firms is this something that the firm is worthy of some sort of competitive response or is it something that schwab isnt really worried about the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 walter w bettinger ii a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp yeah so let me first say that the least innovative thing any company can do in our industry is to buy business by giving someone cash it is certainly a strategy that some firms employ it is not a sustainable strategy over any period of time it is not a sustainable strategy when youre talking about meaningful dollars there have been some rare circumstances where we have chosen on certain clients to respond to those offers when we have responded we have been able to retain the clients that we wanted to retain for about of what maybe an alternative firm might be offering in terms of cash which i think is an interesting reflection of the way the client values the difference in their experience there have been some clients that we have let go without offering any incentive to stay generally speaking those are clients who have chosen to move assets that they have no intention of trading with or doing anything different with so as an example a client might have a significant holding in a given stock microsoft nvidia something like that and theyll take advantage of one of these offers and move those individual positions while leaving the rest of their assets at schwab knowing that theyre not going to liquidate or trade or do anything with those assets and proactively telling us that as soon as the required holding period expires theyll move those assets back to schwab so again its something that goes on in our industry and we watch it very very closely but it is not innovative and it is not sustainable as a means to grow the only way to grow is to delight clients offer them no tradeoffs operate your business through clients eyes thats the only way to have any form of sustainable organic growth and we like our track record at that and are incredibly optimistic about our future with those approaches operator thank you and our next question is from kyle voigt with kbw you may go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning just given the steady progress now on supplemental funding paydown and as we look out over the next months or so it seems that we could be in a zone whereby the securities book is no longer in runoff and to begin to reinvest or even grow the book im wondering if we could get an update on how youre thinking about the ideal structure of the securities portfolio in terms of fixed float mix and duration over the medium term and should we expect any changes to your historical views on balance sheet structure as we get towards growing total interestearning assets once again peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp sure so were still going through the process of thinking through that youre right we will be in a position of course to resume our reinvestment i would characterize the sort of balance sheet changes being more evolutionary versus revolutionary and weve always assumed that when we lose the aoci optout that we would need to be very mindful about the size and duration of our availableforsale portfolio given the potential capital variability that that would create and so i think youll see us take some steps to manage that duration appropriately what that does in terms if you think about our overall consolidated asset duration of sort of to years is sort of top of the house thats still really a tbd but i think on the afs portfolio again youll see us take steps to manage that as i say i think the overall changes there are going to be evolutionary versus again not revolutionary the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp it looks like we have maybe time for one last question so just given the continued interest here maybe well do this last one from the console and maybe walt you could start off just around the general approach that clients are taking on their cash and the continued evolution of those realignment trends more recently walter w bettinger ii a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp yeah and of course peter touched a little bit on it on the earlier question around equity trades i think if you look at the supplemental metrics that we provide with our earnings it really tells an important story that the notion of client cash realigning is a story of and the early parts of when i look at overall balance sheet cash over the last six months its down billion and at the same if i look over the last six months for example just at large capitalization stock purchases which is the largest category by far of equity trades the clients do with us those are up billion and so the concept of realigning is just ph a story of one that has played itself out we were very early in the process we were very proactive at reaching out to our clients encouraging them to move their non transactional or what we call investment cash into higher yielding alternatives not surprising when youre proactive and explain the benefit that to a client they take advantage of it and they did and they did early in the process and today thats just not a meaningful part of our story one last comment on it i know there were past periods where people tried to equate the growth in purchase money funds to impact around client cash realigning and i know peter was particularly clear in emphasizing the danger in doing so that they really werent correlated again go back over those last six months where balance sheet cash went down about billion in total purchase money fund is up billion so theres really no correlation there at this point in time the story of client cash realigning has played out jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp great thanks walt ill turn it over here to peter to close this out peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp all right well thank you jeff and rick and walt and thank you all very much for joining us and hearing our thoughts on the state of our business and the opportunities in front of us were certainly gratified by the momentum were building and the progress were making on the integration of ameritrade and really unleashing as rick talked about the potential of the combined firm the resumption of our historical organic growth rate and really unlocking that core earnings power were certainly mindful that we have a lot of work ahead of us but were really excited about the future and were looking forward to sharing more about what fuels that excitement at our investor day in may next month i hope to see many of you there thanks everyone operator
