alliance bancorporation thanks operator good afternoon and welcome to western alliances third quarter earnings call joining me on the call today are dale gibbons and tim bruckner our chief financial officer and chief credit officer i will provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment and then dale will walk you through the banks financial performance afterwards we will open the line to take your questions id like to focus on three trends that define our third quarter results and will continue into the future robust balance sheet growth provision reflecting asset quality and consensus outlook and strong net interest income and ppnr that continue to build capital the combination of these variables generated record net income of million and eps of each up more than versus the prior quarter and exceeding our prepandemic performance in the flexibility of western alliances diversified business model was again demonstrated this quarter as our deep segment and product expertise enable us to actively adapt our business in response to the changing environment and continue to achieve industryleading profitability and growth while maintaining prudent credit risk management total loans grew million for the quarter to billion and deposits increased billion to billion reducing our loan to deposit ratio to our loan growth continues to be concentrated in low loss asset classes such as warehouse lending which accounted for over of the loan growth and of the deposit growth and million in capital call lines where the riskreward equation is heavily skewed in our favor western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 the impact of this strategy will be seen near term in our reduced provisioning expense and longer term in lower net chargeoffs we are encouraged by our expanding pipeline as clients have applied lessons learned from prior recessions to rightsize cost structures and to begin to plan for future opportunities in the quarter high average interestearning assets of billion were offset by lower rates substantial liquidity build and a onetime adjustment to ppp loan fee recognition to reflect modification and extension of the cares act forgiveness timeframe which pushed our net interest margin downward to as net interest income declined million from the second quarter to million but improved million from a yearago period excluding the impact of ppp loans net interest income would have only fallen by million which is largely the impact of interest expense on our new subordinated debt issued in middle of the second quarter we believe approximately basis points of this compression is transitory in nature and nim is expected to rise as excess liquidity is put to work through balance sheet growth deposit seasonality and warehouse lending driving balances lower and ppp loan forgiveness assumptions normalize given these margin trends and balance sheet growth we believe q4s net interest income performance returns to q2 levels and ppnr rises above q3 provision for credit losses was million in the third quarter considerably less than the million in the second quarter which was primarily attributable to stable to modest improvements in macroeconomic forecast assumptions loan growth in lowrisk asset classes and limited net chargeoffs of million or basis points of average assets dale will go into more detail on the specific drivers of our provision but our total loan acl to funded loans ratio now stands at or million and excluding ppp loans which are guaranteed by the cares act if macroeconomic trends remain stable or begin to improve future provision expense will likely mirror net charge offs and reserve levels could decline loan deferrals trended lower for the quarter as many of our clients have returned to paying as agreed following their deferral period as of q3 billion of loans are on deferral or of the total portfolio which represents a decline from q2 we expect billion of loan deferrals will expire next quarter which will continue to drive down our outstanding modifications our quarterly efficiency ratio improved to compared to from a yearago period becoming more efficient during the economic uncertainty provides the incremental flexibility to maintain ppnr finally western alliance continues to generate significant excess capital which grew tangible book value per share to or over the previous quarter and yearoveryear supported by our robust ppnr generation capital rose million with a cet1 ratio of supporting annualized loan growth dale will now take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation thanks ken over the last three months western alliance generated record net income of million or per share which is up on a linkedquarter basis as ken mentioned net income benefited from reduction in provision expense for credit losses of million primarily driven by stability in the economic outlook during the quarter and a release of specific reserves associated with a fully resolved credit net interest income grew million yearoveryear to million but declined million during the quarter primarily a result of changes in prepayment assumptions on ppp loans that impacted fee accretion western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 recognition the sbas interim final rule published in august more than doubled the amount of time that people have to receive forgiveness on their loans and coupled with the systems delay in forgiveness request processing we now expect debt forgiveness processes to be elongated and the average time the loans will be outstanding is projected to double as well as a result using the effective interest method we reversed out million of the fees recognized in q2 and overall ppp fee recognition has been extended this is purely a change in timing impacting nim but with no change to cumulative fee revenue ultimately recognized from this program the million we are to receive will simply be booked to income more slowly than our original expectations net interest income was impacted in q3 as a result of this timely change by million noninterest income fell to million from the prior quarter we benefited from a recovery of an additional million marktomarket loss on preferred stocks that we recognized in the first quarter over the last two quarters we recovered of that million original loss finally noninterest expense increased million as the deferral of loan origination costs fell as ppp loan originations dropped as well as an increase in incentive accruals as our third quarter performance exceeded our original third quarter budget which was established before the pandemic strong ongoing balance sheet momentum coupled with diligent expense management drove preprovision net revenue to million up yearoveryear and consistent with our overall growth trend from the first quarter as the second quarter benefited from onetime ppp recognition ph above restructuring in fas loan cost deferrals turning now to net interest drivers investment yields decreased basis points from the prior quarter to and fell basis points from the prior year due to the lower rate environment loan yields decreased basis points following declines across most loan types mainly driven by changing loan mix and in the reduction of ppp loan fees resulting in lower ppp loan yield during the quarter notably for both investments and loans spot rates as of september are higher than the third quarter average yields cost of interestbearing deposits was reduced by basis points in q3 to basis points with an endof quarter spot rate of basis points as we continue to lower posted deposit rates and push out higher cost ph exception priced funds the spot rate for total deposits which includes noninterestbearing deposits was basis points when all of the companys funding sources are considered total funding costs declined by basis points with an endofquarter spot rate of basis points unlike last quarter where spot rates indicated a likely margin compression in the third quarter these rates appear to demonstrate that the margin will improve as both earning asset yields will rise and funding costs will fall in the fourth quarter additionally in october we called million of subordinated debt that has diminishing capital treatment with a current rate of despite the transition to a substantially lower rate environment during net interest income increased yearoveryear to million as mentioned earlier during q3 our extraordinary build in liquidity and adjustments to ppp loan fee recognition compressed our net interest margin to as net interest income declined million however the majority of these reduction drivers are transitory ppp loans reduced our nim during the quarter by basis points this changes the prepayment assumptions reduced sba fees recognized resulting in ppp loan yield of excluding this timing difference net interest income declined only million quarteroverquarter primarily due to interest expense on the new subordinated debt that we issued last may resulting in a net interest margin of western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 referring to the bar chart on the lower left section of the page of the million in total ppp loan fees net of origination cost that we received only million was recognized in the third quarter we recognized reversal of ppp of million in q3 and expect fee recognition to be approximately million in the fourth quarter and taper off as prepayments and forgiveness are realized in reality these assumptions are dependent on actual forgiveness from the sba additionally average excess liquidity relative to loans increased million in the quarter the majority of which are held at the federal reserve bank earning minimal returns which impacted nim by approximately basis points in aggregate given our healthy loan pipeline and ability to deploy these funds to higheryielding earning assets we expect this margin drag to dissipate in the coming quarters regarding efficiency on a linkedquarter basis our efficiency ratio increased to as we continue to invest in our business to support future growth opportunities as described earlier the noninterest expense increase is largely related to a net increase in compensation cost as we now have greater confidence in our ability to execute on our prepandemic budget and are no longer benefiting from deferred costs for ppp loan originations excluding ppp net loan fees and interest the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been which as we indicated last quarter should be moving closer to our historical levels in the low return on assets increased basis points from the prior quarter to while provisions fell ppnr roa decreased basis points to as it track the decline in margin from the prior quarter this continued strong performance in capital generation provides us significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth capital management actions or meet our credit demands our strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased million to billion and deposit growth of billion brought our total deposit balance to billion at quarter end inclusive of ppp both loans and deposits grew approximately yearoveryear with our focus on low loss segments and dda the loan to deposit ratio decreased to from in q2 as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs our cash position remains elevated at billion at quarter end compared to billion quarterly average as deposit growth continues to outpace loan originations while this doesnt pay our margin near term we believe it provides us inventory for selective credit growth as demand resumes finally tangible book value per share increased over the prior quarter to an increase of or over the past months the vast majority of the million of loan growth was driven by increases in ci loans of million supplemented by construction loan increases of million residential and consumer loans now comprise of our portfolio while construction loan concentration remains flat at of total loans within the ci growth for the quarter and highlighting our focus on lowrisk assets that ken mentioned capital call lines grew million mortgage warehouse loans grew over billion and corporate finance loans decreased million this quarter residential loan originations were offset by higher prepayment activity leaving the balance fairly flat we continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our firms longterm value creation notably yearoveryear deposit growth of million sic billion is higher than the annual deposit growth in any previous calendar year deposits grew billion or in the western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 third quarter driven by increases in noninterestbearing dda of million which now comprise over of our deposit base plus growth in the savings and money market accounts of million market share gains in mortgage warehouse and robust activity in tech innovation continue to be significant drivers of deposit growth as we initially described on our q1 earnings call wals unique credit risk management strategy is focused on establishing individual borrowerlevel strategies and direct customer dialogue to develop longterm financial plans our approach to payment deferral requests is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients along with assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests we ask our clients to work with us hand in hand whereby our clients contribute liquidity capital or equity as an integral component to modify prepayment plans our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower government and the banks balance sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond the sixmonth window provided for in the cares act by quarter end deferrals had declined by billion or reducing total loan deferrals from at q2 to excluding the hotel franchise finance segment in which we executed a unique sectorspecific deferral strategy the bankwide deferral rate is approximately we have received minimal additional request for further deferrals and of clients with expired deferrals are now current in payments we expect billion of loan deferrals will expire in the current quarter which will substantially drive down outstanding modifications consistent with this trend as of yesterday deferrals are down million in october bringing the current total to million regarding asset quality our nonperforming assets and oreo ratio remained flat at basis points to total assets while total classified assets increased million or basis points to basis points to total assets classified accruing loans rose by million explainable by a few loans days past due as of september all of these loans are now current special mention loans increased million during the quarter to to funded loans which is a result of our credit mitigation strategy to early identify elevate and apply heightened monitoring to loans and segments impacted by the current covid environment over of the increase in special mention loans are from previously identified segments uniquely impacted by the pandemic such as the hotel portfolio and a component of our corporate finance division credits determined to have some level of repayment dependency on travel leisure or entertainment as we have discussed in the past special mention loans are not predictive of future migration to classified or loss essentially over the past five years less than has moved through chargeoffs if borrowers do not have throughcycle liquidity and cash and capital plans we downgrade to substandard immediately to remediate our total allowance for credit losses rose a modest million from the prior quarter due to improvement in macroeconomic forecast and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates additionally we covered million of net chargeoffs the ending allowance related to loan losses was million for cecl we are using a consensus economic forecast outlook of bluechip forecasters as it tracks managements view of the recession and recovery the economic forecast improved during the quarter which would have implied a reserve release however given the still unknown time horizon of covid impacts political western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 uncertainty and the unknown status of further stimulus we adjusted our scenario weightings to a less optimistic outlook in all total loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans declined a modest basis points to or when excluding ppp loans on a more granular level our low loss segments account for approximately onethird of our portfolio and include mortgage warehouse residential and hoa lending capital call lines and resort lending when we exclude these segments the acl to funded loans on the remainder of the portfolio is provision expense decreased to million for q3 driven by loan growth in lower loss segments and improved macroeconomic factors while fully covering chargeoffs net credit losses of million or basis points of average loans were recognized during the quarter compared to million in q2 relative to other banking companies our lower consumer exposure continues to result in much lower total loan losses we continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equity to total assets of and a common equity tier ratio of a decrease of basis points during the quarter due to our strong loan growth excluding ppp loans tce to tangible assets is a modest decline of basis points from the first quarter inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payments of per share our tangible book value per share rose in the quarter to up in the past year we continue to grow our tangible book value per share rapidly as it is increased times that of peers over the last years and ill turn the call back to ken to conclude with comments on a few of our specific portfolios kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation i would now like to briefly update you on our credit risk mitigation efforts and the current status of a few exposures to industries generally considered to be the most impacted by covid19 pandemic throughout the quarter tim bruckner and the credit administration team led ongoing focused portfolio reviews by risk segment to monitor credit exposures and performance against cash budgets operating plans to the liquidity trough we are not waiting for deferrals to run out to make great changes or affect remediation strategies if borrowers are not performing against defined operating plans or determined to not have a sufficient throughcycle liquidity we downgrade them now to substandard and enact remediation strategies to ensure the best outcomes we do not hold loans in sms special mention for a time to eventually downgrade and as a result special mentiongraded loans slowly migrate to classified or substandard these facts and daily conversations with our people and our clients help me feel confident that our credit mitigation strategy and early approach to proactively manage our risk segments is bearing fruit and puts western alliance in a strong position to come out on the other side of the pandemic in better shape than our peers in our million gaming book focused on offstrip middle market gaminglinked companies total deferrals were reduced from of the portfolio to only and as of today its as our clients are now open for business and are performing at or above their reopening plans the billion investor dependent portion of our technology innovation segment has continued to benefit from significant sponsor support for technology firms best positioned to succeed in this covid environment and an active fundraising environment as well western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 since march of our clients have raised over billion in capital resulting in of borrowers with greater than six months remaining liquidity up from in q1 our cre retail book of million focused on local personal servicesbased retail centers with no destination mall exposure continues to modestly exceed national trends that shows rent collections rising from in may to in august similarly this put the portfolios deferrals have fallen from million to million lastly our billion hotel franchise finance business focused on select service hotels with greater financial flexibility and ltvs at origination of approximately continues to trend towards stabilization occupancy rates are tracking national averages currently around which have tripled from april lows at approximately occupancy select service hotels are estimated to cover advertising debt service so a typical hotel is operating at breakeven furthermore we have seen deferrals declined from of the portfolio to of the portfolio and currently we do not anticipate granting any additional deferrals in the hotel portfolio we are proactively engaging with hotel sponsors to validate ongoing support and hotel performance against operating plans as mentioned earlier we are not waiting for deferrals to end before migrating to ensure remediation options with strong sponsor support the worst a ph grade hotel typically receives is sm or special mention we just finished up with our management outlook we believe that our third quarter performance is the baseline for future balance sheet and earnings growth with this record quarter we beat our quarterly budget that was established prepandemic our pipelines are strong and we expect loan growth to return to previously anticipated levels of million to million for the next several quarters in lowrisk asset classes however there will be some offsets as ppp loans pay off or are forgiven depending on timing of the realized ppp forgiveness organic loan growth should more than offset ppp runoff in q4 we expect to see the seasonal declines associated with our mortgage warehouse clients therefore deposit growth will be at the lower end of the target range reducing our excess liquidity to supplement our residential lending initiative we acquired galton funding a residential mortgage platform that specializes in the acquisition of prime nonagency residential home loans the acquisition is a lowrisk lowcost entry point to build a meaningful residential mortgage business line at an accelerated timeframe with over additional mortgage originator relationships we anticipate that the galton team will be fully integrated by the end of october and be contributing to loan growth by the end of the year as dale mentioned our current spot rates indicate that the net interest margin pressure experienced this quarter will subside and net interest margin will trend upwards towards in q4 we expect net interest income to rise in q4 aided by both an increased nim and higher endofquarter loan balances compared to the quarterly average additionally it is expected that ppp fee income will pick up next quarter as forgiveness is granted this will however abate during ppnr is expected to increase as net interest income growth will more than offset any increase in noninterest expense looking ahead we will continue to invest in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency but q2 and q3 efficiency ratios are temporary and will eventually return to a sustainable level in the low our longterm asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by economic consensus forecast which if consistent going forward could imply reserve releases in the coming quarters we believe that the provisions in excess of chargeoffs yeartodate are more than sufficient to cover chargeoffs through the cycle as we do not see any indicators than imply material losses are on the horizon western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 finally western alliance is one of the most prolific capital generators in the industry our strong capital base and access to ample liquidity will allow us to take advantage of any market dislocations to maintain leading risk adjusted returns to address any future credit demands all while maintaining flexibility to improve shareholder returns at this time dale i and tim will take your questions operator if you want to open up the line question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from brad milsaps of piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale or ken i just wanted to make sure i understood kind of all the moving parts around the balance sheet it sounds like a lot of the growth that you saw at the end of the quarter was mortgage warehouse related which can obviously be very volatile into the quarter can vary given the average as you go into the fourth quarter is your expectation that youre going to be able to replace that if it does wane a little bit with other types of loan growth you also mentioned that you also just expect deposits from that from the warehouses to go down so youll get some liquidity bleed there as well just want to understand kind of what the moving parts would be within average earning assets as you go into with kind of everything weve talked about kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so mortgage warehouse had a great quarter as you can see by the results they are increasing market share simultaneously as our warehouse lending clients increase their activity or see increased activity so were getting a two for one and thats why you saw the increase the large increase in loan balances this quarter q4 is traditionally a little lighter and so were just sticking to our q4 analysis or historical viewpoint that loan growth there will be less and yes our model is designed such that we can replace loan growth there with other loan growth around the company and thats why were giving you the million to million range for q4 loan growth and also the same for deposits they lose some of their deposits in q4 as taxes are paid dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation brad i would also say that we have a senior loan committee that meets weekly that approves the largest credits in the company and the activity level of loans coming in from the line to that committee which is loans above western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 million has really stepped up significantly over the past couple of months compared to where we were say in the second quarter and so we think were seeing broader strength in other classes of loan credit and at the same time on the deposit side despite what we think may happen in terms of the warehouse lending piece were seeing some increase in some of these other channels as well that i think are going to bear fruition in the fairly near term kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah just to add to dale i mean were seeing strength in capital call business were seeing strength in the cre business certainly around the industrial side where were building were doing a lot of deals for distribution centers and then tech innovation is seeing a lot of new opportunities as well brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co and maybe just to follow up on the loan growth where are kind of new loan yields coming on the books i know you mentioned a spot rate of but kind of curious where new production is coming on and then can you talk a little bit more about the impact of the acquisition that you made how much you paid kind of whats the incremental benefit you kind of see over the next to months dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation sure so in terms of the yeah that spot rate is really a spot on in terms of kind of where the numbers are so the actual loans that have come on have been about basis points higher yielding than what the average was and i think thats kind of reflected there again we have a lot of discipline in our team in terms of putting in a floor so lets suppose somebody makes a loan at l plus or l plus what well define in the loan docs that l cant go below in that situation thats a really common structure for us so the floor is active on the first day and thats how were able to sustain new originations really right on top of the current yield kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so ill take the second half galton first we didnt pay much money for it at all all right and its a mortgage business that specializes on buying nonqm loans from warehouse lenders and so nonqm mortgages have a slightly different feature than standard agency paper they sometimes offer interestonly features or they have more selfemployed borrowers but they underwrite very low ltvs in the to range and the paper carries higher yields than the standard agency paper so standard agency paper could be like and these yields will be to the acquisition came with people salespeople and operations people and it provides us with a dedicated sales force and servicing operations so this will allow us to ramp up our residential purchase volume while improving customer service with knowledgeable experts it provides crossselling opportunities to the galton customer base galton has warehouse lenders that they work with of which is an overlap with us but the other will allow us to offer warehouse lending lines and then to remove mortgages off of the warehouse lending line onto our balance sheet if they fit our credit box weve seen galton in operation for a couple years weve probably seen over mortgages that theyve underwritten so we have a real sense that their approach to credit mirrors ours and we think the big impact here will be seen middle of next year as this thing continues to ramp up and we bring them into the fold here western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 so where we were doing residential mortgages either bulk purchases or forward flow agreements off the side of our desk meaning other people had other responsibilities we now have a dedicated team to do this and thats knowledgeable people and thats what excites us about this opportunity brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys ill hop back in the queue thanks operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question dale i just want to make sure i got the fourth quarter guide indiscernible pretty quickly the i believe ken you said margin is that a fully loaded margin with the impact of the fees from the ppp dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation correct yeah the million level that we show on that one page so rebounding from the second quarter but much lower than what we had rebounding from the third quarter but lower than we had in the second christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and based on the balance sheet the comment was fourth quarter reported allin net interest income higher than second quarter reported right dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great in terms of the growth strategy can you just size up how big the warehouse is and the capital call book dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so the warehouse book is billion and capital call is million christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 getting to your question chris yeah no we see that we have kind of stability here we have an opportunity to continue to sustain earning asset growth so we believe we can even if there were margin pressure in that weve got the growth trajectory that we can sustain increases in net interest income christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it understood and if we look maybe one more on just the mix of the earning asset if we look at the mix between cash and securities its call it roughly of earning asset is that the same is that a proportional mix youd expect of the balance sheet going forward maybe toggling between cash and securities dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i think we can take our cash down to something in kind of the low to midhundreds of millions we think thats really kind of the floor for us and so were up at billion that gives us a fair amount of room in the federal reserve i mean its not a criticism but they pay basis points so we think that the we know liquidity is abundant these days at banking companies but we think that actually garnering more relationships and even if theyre flat or even slightly negative in terms of price and obviously they crushed the margin because you get a big balance at a zero spread or something like that but we think thats going to bode well in the future as we come out of this situation and as ken mentioned weve got some funding among other channels where weve got opportunities to really grow safely on the credit side christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the investment portfolio dale is that just kind of indiscernible for that based on the deposit i mean how are you thinking about the size of the bond book dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah i think the bond book could actually i dont know if its got a lot of room i think were comfortable with our loan to deposit ratio in the so thats going to drive some of the investment securities portfolio but weve got a couple billion dollars billion of mortgagebacked securities in there that are yielding million million less than if we buy we think similar risk credit with low ltv first mortgages so theres a possibility that after we sap up our current liquidity through residential and other channels that maybe we dont need to grow the msr book anymore and that could become a smaller proportion of the balance sheet in aggregate christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then last one if i could just everyones topic on taxes anything meaningfully different in your tax structure and strategy today if we got a tax increase the same math opposite direction wouldnt work next year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah yeah so i mean i think you could the proportion holds pretty well so even though our tax rate may be lower than some others basically looking if youre going to million and youre at million thats a increase in the tax rate if you take our tax expense say for the third quarter which was million and say western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 gosh if that were to go into effect our tax recognition expense would be up for this similar quarter would be about million higher about a third higher christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thanks a lot operator our next question comes from michael young of truist please go ahead michael young q analyst truist securities hey thanks for taking the question was kind of curious it sounds like theres an effort to grow the balance sheet maybe with some more residential or warehouse but i was kind of curious just about the tradeoff between growing a balance sheet in some of those more nonrelationshiporiented areas versus maybe just looking at a share buyback program and larger proportion so just kind of growing balance sheet versus returning capital and how you guys are thinking about the tradeoff between the two kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah i would argue that we do have relationships and what were doing is with each warehouse lending customer we have a warehouse lending relationship we could have an msr relationship we can have note financing relationships they provide deposits to us and they also provide us with a goforward flow on residential mortgages so dont think about the relationship as the end customer in their home think of it as the mortgage servicer which controls a lot of business and we see an opportunity now theres dislocation in the market with a number of mergers and also id just say poor performance that were coming in with higher hightouch customer service that were getting business thats coming to us and were not having to struggle to bring that business in so that to us is very important and thats whats driving the balance sheet growth were not trying to buy mortgages for mortgages sake its really the warehouse lenders and those relationships that we have with them dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation in terms of the repurchases i mean where we are with this is we can sustain a balance sheet growth and while we dont have an indiscernible of being opportunistic in terms of share price we think the longterm value creation is from expanding the franchise michael young q analyst truist securities okay thats fair i appreciate it and then maybe just on credit have you actually foreclosed on or liquidated any of the hotel assets or any other cre assets that have given you any more confidence or anything any color you could provide on those books kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 theres been no liquidation no foreclosures the hotel book is given its circumstances performing okay of the book has a debt service coverage ratio above is below it and then weve got a few construction loans so we dont have a debt service coverage ratio on that you can see hotel occupancy coming back to thats about where our hotels are tracking to the national averages again when we underwrote these hotels we underwrote good liquid sponsors that have the ability to call on capital from their lps and they did that to enter into many of the plus or plus deferral relationships tim do you want to say anything else timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorporation yeah i think its important to remember we started this dialogue particularly with hotel in february we brought together the segment we put dynamic leadership some of our seniormost executives in place and weve maintained that dialogue around liquidity operating performance and forwardlooking capital plans that has allowed us to be way out ahead of problems that arise here so weve got strong sponsorship weve got an active dialogue and were seeing good progress towards stabilization michael young q analyst truist securities okay thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thank you operator our next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just wanted to ask on the mortgage acquisition that you talked about earlier day one are there any other is the revenue coming off that purely the mortgages that you put on balance sheet or is there any other associated revenue or fees anything that would be related to that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation no no it comes off of the revenue comes off of the mortgages put on balance sheet and weve been just integrating the team over the last three weeks or so so were not looking for any mortgages to begin to hit the balance sheet maybe for another two or three weeks gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and dale you may have alluded to this when you talked about kind of balancing the investment portfolio against the resi book youve been hanging around in the kind of or plus or minus in terms of residential loans where would you take that indiscernible now that youve got this other kind of stream of product coming in western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation right i think its got a lot of runway in front of it i dont have a number for you for where it might stop but as you know a typical bank that number is going to be about triple that concentration level which is even with the growth rates that were talking about augmented with galton and what weve been doing before jeez i mean if we could take it to on a growing balance sheet thats going to be a substantial increase in the balances outstanding so i think weve got years for this thing to run we think its a strong asset class to be in we think the rates work now weve been as you know asset sensitive were really now kind of asymmetric and this balances that out as well so we think its a good place to be its a lower riskweighted asset category and were one of the smallest out there in terms of relative exposure gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thanks my other questions were already answered kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thanks operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hello great thanks for the questions dale i guess if you could talk about you touched on this in your prepared remarks i guess in terms of the deposits how much of those do you think you can kind of hold on to going forward whats the volatility of the deposit mix at this point dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i think its good but theres two areas that i want to keep my eye on one of them is ill call it ppp deposits so we took billion of loans that we made and we deposited into these accounts and we track how much money is still there and that number is still over billion and its like was that going to get burned somehow at some point in time maybe thats a little bit lazy because were in this kind of norate environment so we want to keep our eye on that piece of the thing and then the second piece is kind of the mortgage warehouse area obviously its been a torrid pace of refinancing thats going to increase volumes generally and so i think is there space for kind of a take a breather in that scenario now my read of whats transpiring is while maybe the refi business is going to temper to some degree theres still a lot of people that are eligible for refi in terms of putting themselves in a lower area but is there some air that can come out of that i think there is what do we have well weve talked about our two business lines that are deposit generating those both did run into a little bit of a sidetrack because of the pandemic each of them benefits from kind of inperson contact or development of personal relationships with these enterprises that they service we think thats coming out of it western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 now we think those pipelines look strong also ken mentioned the tech innovation space and one of our competitors is fairly bullish in terms of what that outlook is like and we would second that assessment so while we may see softness in a couple of these categories that have been really powerful in we think weve got handoffs that we could make to kind of sustain the ph realigned performance in to some of these new areas brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and separately just on the galton acquisition and the nonqm and that encompasses many different flavors of mortgage origination is this generally paper that just doesnt quite check the agency box or is it more of a heavier credit component to it and i guess separately whats the stepup from vanilla agency origination whats the stepup in rate with this paper kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah it just doesnt check the box for the agencies and the stepup in paper is about brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thats pretty fair thank you operator our next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting with efficiency it seems like nii has seemingly reached a bottom here in the third quarter and should start improving in the fourth quarter as we look ahead should we expect a similar level of operating leverage whether its or as weve seen in recent years or does the current rate environment present enough challenges where its likely going to be lower than that for the foreseeable future dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i think we can sustain where we are in terms of the operating expense level so yeah we think the margin is fairly stable even if rates kind of stay at this level for maybe in perpetuity for certainly an extended period of time and then our expenses running at around relative to the revenue we bring in we think thats pretty sustainable as well western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 so we had some volatility in the second quarter for a variety of reasons we talked about really and underscores that were looking at the third quarter of as really being a pretty good baseline i know some of you have commented or looked at that we had this gain from securities gains kind of recovery of about million in the third quarter which of course we did but in my view i dont back that out in terms of what a run rate is because im offsetting that with the reversal we had in ppp kind of going forward so we think the revenue is a good base to come from we think the expense base is a good base from which to grow but again holding in at kind of the low on efficiency timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then i just want to make sure im thinking about deferrals correctly so the billion of deferrals that are rolling off in the fourth quarter how much of that was part of the plus program and for those loans is it now that the liquidity that was collected as part of the initial deferral processes is that now kicking in for another six months or is that entire balance going to be moving into performing status essentially dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so i mean they prepaid i mean so before they got six months of deferral they prepaid another six months and this is what we recommended that they do because it takes them out until the second quarter of next year which you can different assumptions in terms of when we get out of this but with therapeutics that i think vaccines are just frankly pretty close around the corner that i think by that point in time these entities those hotels are going to be able to benefit from kind of relaxed social distancing and so they prepaid it all so yes they are paying as agreed because theyre dipping into basically a control account that is making the principal and interest debt service as they come off of deferral timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and is that around that plus of that or is it going to be a smaller amount of that billion dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well of those that are coming off in the fourth quarter its predominantly the plus because they were done i mean we did some that were plus those typically came off mostly in the third quarter right so in the fourth quarter were going to those are the plus that were done in the second quarter of this year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then one last one for me just looking at the technology sector another strong quarter of growth but i noticed that the allowance for that sector declined on a linkedquarter basis was that the specific reserve release that you spoke of or was there something else going on in that portfolio that indiscernible reduction in allowance kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 no that was part of it that drove the decline in balances was a reserve release on an asset that we were able to get off our books and we were happy to get off our books timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you very much operator our next question comes from david chiaverini of wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks couple of questions for you and the first one is a strategic question on mortgage warehouse with it now billion of loans and you addressed a little bit about this with the deposit discussion but i was curious because some investors have expressed concern generally about seasonality and volatility around the mortgage warehouse business can you talk about how youre viewing that business and addressing that volatility over time as we look ahead dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so i mean we thought this was again if you look at kind of the business lines with which we can select from and which to grow this was a great time to go into mortgage warehouse the demand was strong the quality is excellent and because of the cycle where we are interest rates after the fomc actions its a robust growing area so yeah i mean i dont think that whats going on there is sustainable long term if rates start to rise i think its going to come down significantly although the purchase market is pretty active still and that maybe has more legs to it and less cyclicality but in any event i mean i think its just a good example of hey we can go here because this is safe this has activity this is something where we can move to in the immediate timeframe that we did that basically earlier this year if that pulls back in which i think is a reasonable probability like i mentioned were looking at the things that are coming to our credit committee and theyre strong and theyre diversified and we think that thats where we can kind of pivot to as this one may wane a bit kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation let me just add first remember that while we have billion sitting out there in loans we have almost an equal amount billion sitting out there in deposits so its a great strength of deposit growth for us and so i think thats important to remember the other thing is when we say warehouse lending you got to remember that includes msr lending that includes note financing and warehouse lending and so its a combination of all those things so we do have some other levers to pull when were dealing with some of our clients david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thats really helpful color and then shifting gears you mentioned about the potential for reserve releases looking out over the next few quarters or towards the maybe middle or end of but nonetheless i was curious do you have a target reserve to loan ratio in mind western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation we dont because its so dependent on each particular asset type so that number has as weve grown in these categories that are about a third of our balance sheet now that are little to zero loss mortgage warehouse public finance capital call lines residential mortgages resort finance as those have become a larger proportion that number is going to fall and so i think you need to look at it more on a categorybycategory basis i mean if you look back to kind of what a standard normal situation might be if you take where numbers were as of before this pandemic started and then add in the overlay that was done at the beginning of this year for the adoption the cecl which frontloads provisioning as everyone is well aware that number was about a number for us in terms of reserve level i think in a more kind of benign environment and less uncertainty i think you kind of go back to that level with that mix if the mix is lower i think that number could even fall further david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much operator our next question comes from andrew terrell of stephens please go ahead andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc so most of my questions have been asked and answered at this point i do just want to touch on the increase in compensation this quarter was there included in that number any type of catchup from prior quarters that we would see fall out of the run rate kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah thats exactly it as we move closer to our performance targets we caught up for the first two quarters as well andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just a biggerpicture question ph these two i guess overall revenue are consistently just around the midsingledigit range if we are in a lower for longer interest rate environment are there any thoughts to potentially growing out any specific offerings in the fee income base western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so were always looking at that as you know were very low we lead the industry in many different categories we do not lead the industry fee income and so we are working on a few things i would say theyre going to be marginal at this point theres nothing thats going to move the needle as we look towards so were a spread business and for us its important for that balance sheet growth to occur good asset quality of course that will negate some of the lower funding lower interest rate environment but remember were able to get floors on our loans and of our loans have floors and so the impact to us on a nim basis will not be as great andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc thats helpful thanks for taking my question operator our next question will come from jon arfstrom of rbc please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i think everythings pretty much been covered but perhaps a philosophical question for tim or ken we kind of look at this as youre making more than you were prepandemic your returns are tangible return on tangible is almost ph stock plus so the gap is probably credit concern do you feel like were all overreacting to that or should we expect some kind of a surge in losses over the next few quarters that doesnt seem like youre indicating but are we missing something here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation the short answer is yes i mean if you piece through everything we said today we said that the baseline of earnings for q3 the million this quarter is going to be the baseline going forward for the upcoming quarters into assuming at this point the same provisioning of about million now we dont see large losses on the horizon we dont see chargeoffs rising dramatically its hard to find them in our book of business at this point so even our provision may be a little high and certainly would be a little high if the consensus economic forecast is changed to be more favorable for the vaccines and what have you and more states opening up after the election so i think that the a lot of investors ill say it that way overreacted to what they thought our losses could be all right almost billion of our book is in really really low loss categories and as i said we dont see the losses coming our way and were feeling good about where our net interest income is going to be in q4 and were feeling good that the baseline for earnings is what you see this quarter western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats all i had thank you kenneth a vecchione
