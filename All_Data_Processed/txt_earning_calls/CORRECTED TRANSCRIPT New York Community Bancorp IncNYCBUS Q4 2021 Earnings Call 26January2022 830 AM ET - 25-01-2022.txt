moderate income families and communities to small businesses and the continuation of the expansion of our responsible multifamily lending practices the pledge agreement was developed in collaboration with ncrc and its members while locally we work hand in hand with anhd we spent nine months working on this agreement and that with nearly member organizations across the country and came away very

quarter as loans grew billion compared to the third quarter of the year this was the strongest growth quarter for lending since the first quarter of the majority of this growth was in the multifamily portfolio which increased billion or to billion and billion a linked quarter basis this was driven by increased activity on the part of both existing and new borrowers prompted by the outlook for higher interest rates a significant uptick in property transactions and the companys proven ability to service and meet the needs of our borrowers growth in specialty finance portfolio rebounded strongly during the fourth quarter as the economy continues to improve specialty finance loans increased or million on a yearoveryear basis and now total billion while total commitments saw billion up compared to last year of the billion in commitment or billion are structured as floating rate obligations additionally given the amount of unused commitments we believe that as the supply chain issues ease borrowers will draw down on their unused lines setting the segment up for a very strong loan growth anticipated for as well originations are also very strong during the fourth quarter total fourth quarter originations were billion up compared to the third quarter of the year originations exceeded the prior quarters pipeline by billion of the fourth quarter originations were due to property transactions were refinances out of other banks portfolios and were refis from our existing portfolio additionally the pipeline heading to the first quarter of is robust at billion which bodes well for first quarter originations and anticipated growth of this amount of that portfolio is new money switching over to the deposit side deposits totaled billion at yearend up billion or

shareholders and our company our employees continue to be a key contributor to the ongoing success of this organization with that we would be happy to answer any questions you may have well do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or during the week operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question has come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning tom how are you thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i am well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just so the question first on the timing of the deal i think i heard you say you feel good about closing it in just wondering if you can narrow down that window given what agreement that you achieved weve seen other banks announce get fed approval around the deals in recent week like is it could we see approvals happening within the next few weeks or is that too optimistic thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc appreciate the question obviously we were very specific about where we are i mean obviously spending a lot of time on getting our community pledge agreement done that was a major milestone for the company and i think were pretty clear that this will pave the way for the approval process were very confident that well get the deal closed as far as the timing its in the hands of the regulators again i wish i can give you more detail about that but i think it was pretty clear ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and i guess then tom remind us around just rate sensitivity with the fed expected to hike maybe as early as march i mean how do we think about standalone nycb margin in that backdrop and also remind us what the flagstar balance sheet does for rate sensitivity if we get multiple rate hikes over the next year or two new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc well ill start the question answer the question ill defer to john but big picture is that we see absent flagstar the continuation of margin expansion ebrahim as you know we have a sizable derivative that comes off this quarter that adds about million plus top line revenue to the company as that just expires so we continue to see margin expansion in the short term for nycb exflagstar and obviously weve pro formaed this both ways so were very comfortable with our position financially im going to defer to john as far as the guidance on rate increases and the like john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah we are anticipating of course as the fed had telegraphed rate increases in our standalone forecasting and budgeting but as tom mentioned we do see margin expansion in the first quarter primarily given the roll off of the interest rate swap that we have on our books in the middle of february we expect that to be about basis points in the first quarter from an expansion perspective and then when you look at on a consolidated basis with flagstar flagstar is substantially asset sensitive so that will dramatically moderate the liability sensitive nature on our books as well as we hope our initiatives on the deposit on the banking as a service side right thats the goal is to limit their reliance on home loan bank and on a standalone basis try to moderate our own interest rate risk sensitivity but the flagstar transaction does that pretty quickly once its closed thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc ebrahim i just wanted to add to that point on funding we have culturally changed the direction on how we look at lending we lend with the expectation that we receive the operating accounts and as many compensating balance as possible as we push our technology service that we can provide to our customer base that has been a significant shift for the company i believe its around increase yearoveryear on operating activity thats tied to the loan customers if you remember when i had my first call as ceo we talked about the low lying fruit now our team our board our entire culture has focused on getting that relationship lending in place so were very pleased about our first years results the sizable increase historically if you know the company it was a growth by acquisition company on the funding side this year on a standalone basis weve done a tremendous job in on bringing in deposits and these are operating accounts these are relationship deposits its the focus of the change in the culture at the bank ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just two followups john you mentioned basis points impact in whats the full quarter impact as we think about the hedge roll off thinking about and then the banking as a service is i think you mentioned billion in yearend deposits i know you made a few hires over the last year how big can that book get how fast can it grow and whats the rate sensitivity of those deposits that come to that banking as a service channel new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so im going to change the order im going to just answer banking as a service and ill throw them all back to john ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i mean look were very excited what was going on bas and were also super excited about what were going to do with mas which is mortgage as a service which i believe is going to be a significant benefit to the company when we combine with flagstar they have so much liquidity over at flagstar the fact that theyre not truly taking advantage of that mortgage as a service business is because of their balance sheet concerns they dont need the liquidity on a combined basis we will embrace that so collectively absent flagstar we see some very strong initiatives there are some significant items in the pipeline that we cant speak to yet because theyre not public but have pretty big wins that we anticipate getting that will lead towards this very low stable cost of funds benefit for funding that could also drive the income possibilities as they get approved and they officially become public well let the world be aware of that but these are a unique focus for the bank that coupled with the fact that we also banking some of the smaller technology companies that as well as some of the smaller banks that are not going past the billion government threshold on the cards perspective so were looking for the excess liquidity to hover on our balance sheet as an alternative solution to fund our balance sheet which has been working out very well on an average basis last year the numbers were much more than billion just because of the amount of activity that was orchestrated by the government but we have further contracts that we believe would be very fruitful for our horizon in the short term now this is going to be an ongoing buildout of the business we want to tie in some of our fintech initiatives that were working with with our technology partners to also use our banking as a service so as you said we have hired some people and we anticipate hiring more people as we build out the business but again this business was zero deposits as of january and now were looking at a sizable opportunity and when you ratchet on mortgage as a service that number could be significant john on the ph margin or im not sure if we touched the margin slide so maybe john wants to maybe you can repeat the question to john on the margin ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah john one the full quarter impact as we look into from the hedge roll off i know you mentioned basis points and secondly if the deal is not closed lets say until june and we get a march fed rate hike do you still expect the margin to expand in the second quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc look i want to be very clear because i know you john is the cfo and john could specifically talk to this but i will be very clear weve always never give that one data guidance you know the culture here ebrahim so we gave out the short dated guidance were very confident that were positioned well and much better than today than we were in previous years but involving flagstar this company has a significant earnings power that were anticipating absent flagstar were very comfortable with a very strong profitability on a standalone basis we gave out the first quarter but i will tell you its a good try to get john to give out guidance beyond the q1 thank you for that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question has come from the line of christopher mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi guys good morning hey good morning looking at the slide deck from this morning and you referenced the accretion from the deal which was announced last year obviously rate expectations have changed a bit and the mortgage market is changing so im interested if theres any change to that and also if you could provide some color gain on sale margins at flagstar were soft im wondering if you can give a little bit of an outlook for the first quarter and the intermediate term outlook thanks john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure chris this is john ill start and then ill hand it over to lee when we looked at when we announced the deal at were very comfortable with the economics that we laid out at the time of the deal announcement theres no doubt that the earnings from both institutions were stronger in than what was originally forecasted in that deal and we believe will probably be the same but well see depending on the rate environment so i would say were very comfortable with the accretion percentages that we put out and if anything the capital is probably a little bit higher right now given the earnings contribution from both organizations but especially from the flagstar organization lee you want to jump in on mortgage banking lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah and i think the question was around margins so thanks john what i would say on margins in the fourth quarter there was some competitive factors and forces that came into play and then you had the rising rate environment and so people were trying to fill capacity and so that had an impact on margins but also from our new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 point of view there was some ph rmbx related margin impacts we went to market with a couple of deals and the market was saturated we didnt quite get the execution that we were expecting and then we had a pricing adjustment on nonowner occupied loans after the fhfa lifted or suspended their caps on such loans as we look forward into q1 we believe the gain on sale revenues will be similar or slightly better than what you saw in q4 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then maybe just a technical on the borrowings you added in the quarter what was the rates on those new borrowings john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so we did a mixture of borrowings in the fourth quarter the longer term borrowings weve put on were threeyear at approximately a onepointthreefourpercent and then we did have some shortterm borrowings that were overnight at weekly rate christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steve moss with b riley please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning maybe just following on loan growth here curious you sound pretty upbeat about loan growth expectations tom and just wondering how youre thinking about here thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc great question i mean yes were very upbeat i will tell you that our people are really busy the fourth quarter was an active quarter and it continuous in q1 so if you look at the pipeline north of billion billion which almost of it is new money pipeline its an active period were seeing significant activity on the anticipation of higher rates were hearing many property transactions that are in the market thats a significant change that was going you didnt see that even prepandemic so the fact that property transactions are occurring is a very good sign we talked a little bit about manhattan how the market has come back significantly we really havent done much on the pure cre side so multifamily has been our focus as well as specialty finance but it feels like the market is seeing a lot more property transactions and our pipeline is very strong as far as growth for the year i mean normally around this time we kind of target im moving towards more up a single digit as we start the year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 given the significant q1 pipeline which is not typical for us typically we have a strong q4 like we anticipated in and then we kind of have a little bit of a slowdown in q1 and we ramp up but its coming out of the gate very strong steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and the rate environment is strong the spreads are between million and million over the fiveyear for shorter duration paper which has been very very very good for us given the shape of the curve even though its come down a little bit in the backend it seems like the portfolio lenders will have an advantage here versus gses just given the shape of the curve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful i was doing my next question and then in terms of the pro forma combination with flagstar maybe just following up on the assumptions here since its been a little bit delayed i hear you on the buyback given higher capital levels just kind of curious if there are any other changes in terms of thoughts around balance sheet restructuring or things you may do as you combine here thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc look were very excited about the opportunity we talked about reactivating the repurchase activity thats just the function of capital planning going forward if you look at the pro forma capital position as john indicated we have more capital based on their higher earnings profile since we announced the transaction they made more money the capital coffers had built up i think on a pro forma basis were just south of on cet1 so thats a pretty big ratio that were typically on a standalone basis not accustomed to so thats going to give us a lot of capital maneuverability as we make choices in how we reallocate capital so reactivating the buyback obviously was really a function of the marketplace and our vision as we allocate capital on a combined basis back to shareholders we have a very strong dividend that will continue but at the same time this company is going to generate a lot of capital as mr pinto indicated theres no adjustment towards the earnings profile on a combined basis so if you think about what we talked about when we announced the deal theres a lot of excess capital thats going to come out of this company on a combined basis steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc as far as we got indiscernible and just to go back to the restructuring side we were going to look at it opportunistically when the companies come together we have a lot of flexibility depending on how large mortgage as a service could actually become i think it could be a material number as we dive into their clientele new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 and look at the excess liquidity thats in the marketplace so we can harbor on our combined balance sheets that can give us a lot of flexibility to get away from some of the other dependencies the fundings that we typically utilize historically so i think wed have a more stable funding position as we roll out mortgage as a service they do it now on a combined basis can be very material for the company and gives us lots of funding options as we combine steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great and then maybe just on the flagstar side question for lee just kind of as we think about just what is the mix of purchase versus refi and just kind of curious as to direct lending i know theres a pretty healthy amount of volume and your highest gain on sale margin just kind of color around some of the market dynamics there lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah no problem at all i mean if you look at the latest fannie freddie in mba forecasts theyre forecasting a trillion market in but the composition is flipping to being twothirds purchase onethird refi and it was the opposite in it was twothirds refi onethird purchase i think look the big variable in this is inflation and the fed has been very clear this is their immediate priority which could lead to additional interest rate hikes in and at some point that could start to impact affordability and again a trillion mortgage market while very strong its still a reduction on so there is still excess capacity in the system we will continue to leverage our diversified mortgage business given we originate in all six channels you mentioned direct lending were investing in technology to enable us to originate more purchase business in the direct lending channel were going to rely on our broad product offerings the benefit we have of the execution optionality afforded to us by being a bank having a balance sheet the rmbs program as well as the sale program weve built a variable cost structure to of that cost are variable or semivariable and then coming back to what tom said youve then got all the benefits of merging with nyc bigger balance sheet additional capital and a broader footprint so we feel pretty good about albeit weve got a i think were all sort of looking at inflation and how the fed is going to react to counteract that steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc all right thank you very much appreciate all the color thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question has come from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you hey good morning good morning you mentioned the cost base on the flagstar side variable or semi variable i noticed mortgage expenses dropped just million your gain on sales under pretty heavy pressure here is there some offsetting expenses that we would expect to come out in q1 lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah heres what brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah are you talking about on the mortgage side brock specifically brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yes specifically yes lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah heres what id say as it relates to the cost on the mortgage side we will be proactive in adjusting capacity as necessary we built these flexible capacity model to scale up and down with volume that leverages thirdparty vendors weve crosstrained our existing staff and to are variable or semi variable and then weve got scale right and the beauty of that platform is that helps a lot and weve proven our ability historically to manage costs depending on where volumes and revenues are what i would say to you though is in q1 you dont want to react too quickly as youre going into spring buying season and so we do want to sort of see how things play out in february and march going into april to see if that bump is there because as i mentioned earlier were still looking at a trillion market here and its pivoting to purchase so we want to watch that but at the same time weve got this variable cost structure in place and we will manage cost accordingly and depending on whats happening to revenues alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc and if i could jump in here on this this is sandro page of our deck has a chart there that shows the mortgage expense and you can see its relatively stable as a percentage of closings quarteroverquarter the thing i would remind you of is that gain on sale is based on the lock date expenses come in when we close so theres a little bit of an imbalance sometimes there but overall when you look at it from a 12month perspective typically the expenses are going to be in that to range of closings and that as lee has said thats been very very stable historically and so we will manage to that kind of expense levels new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i dont mean to beat up on flagstar expenses because these mortgage trends were seeing across the sector i just i guess im struggling with the accretion assumptions in the transaction in the merger given that this diminished earnings power were seeing into well q4 but probably ph ended in q1003302 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc hey brock let me follow brock let me followup on that point i mean remember when came together with our joint press release and we announced the deal we assumed forecast down on our model and they had a tremendous year if you forecast that into the run rate were very comfortable that our guidance out there is solid brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right yeah alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc i would that i mean if you look at overall flagstar results while there is certainly some disappointment with the mortgage results for q4 the numbers overall are strong right we didnt miss on earnings despite the level of revenue in the mortgage business return on equity was strong were not sometimes were viewed as a mortgage company were not we really are a bank and the returns that weve produced in times where mortgage is challenging i would ask you to look back to when the revenue in the mortgage business was more like what you saw in q4 and we still had strong returns on equity and we still have that in q4 and if you look in between when the mortgage market was extremely robust we had returns that were double our peers so i dont think you should view the current situation in the mortgage business as one that causes flagstars returns to be less than what you would be satisfied with were completely confident that the companys performance is going to continue to be at the top end for the midsized bank range as a standalone company brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay appreciate the color thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i would also add to sandros commentary there that obviously in a rising rate environment we will look to utilize our balance sheet for growth i mean obviously the locations on retail plus the locations on origination that we expand upon in our product mix we will start looking at portfolioing some of these higher yielding type loans on the balance sheet as well and i think when you think about growth going back to our original forecast the growth was de minimis when we pro forma this transaction back in april as we get to know each other here through our merger integration process we believe we have significant potential growth together as we build out this business new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of david rochester with compass point please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys just a quick question for sandro and lee i know you guys had mentioned a normalized mortgage add per quarter of million its maybe more of a target or something you thought you could do just given the gain on sale hit that weve had this quarter to million and your guide for something similar maybe a little bit better it sounds like in are you thinking that million might actually end up coming in a little bit lower and then its a part two just given your outlook on rates and your knowledge of seasonality of the business and whatnot are you expecting some kind of a pickup in that gain on sale in or is it too soon to tell at this point alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc so let me start and lee can add if he like certainly million is a target and when you annualize that to get to million thats really where we would love to see it but we believe that if its less than that then as i said in the in response to the previous call that if thats whats going on in mortgage then theres other things that are compensating for that in the other parts of the business were very confident about the growth of our banking business like tom indicated with nycb our commitments are growing at a very strong level our pipeline is very very robust so as we look forward we think that given the high quality of credit that we have the control that were maintaining over expenses overall as a percentage of our revenues are going to allow flagstar regardless of whether mortgage or gain on sale is million or million average per quarter put us in a position that as i said previously to continue the level of earnings that we reported previously because while all of this has been going on over the last two years with mortgage being extremely strong weve been quietly building everything else in the company so now were positioned where we can still be very very profitable in a quarter like q4 where ph gas was pressured david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then in terms of how youre thinking about and maybe a pickup there lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah yeah its lee let me new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc for q2 yeah right after we wont go to lee can give you a little feeling about lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah no i was going to just piggyback off of sandros comments i agree with that i think the target that we put out you easily can break it down to the million but its really more of an annualized target if we can get to million million but as we said right weve got a variable cost structure and so if it isnt there we will manage the cost side appropriately i think to sandros point weve always had it when we built this diversified bank at flagstar that has enabled us to produce strong earnings whatever is going on with mortgage and when mortgage is hot then our returns are outsized were going to be even more diversified when we come together with new york community bank and i think that is the power of this transaction this franchise together can be successful in any interest rate environment i dont want to look into q2 because again right now theres just a lot going on from a macroeconomic point of view with inflation and what the fed is going to do to react to that so were just guiding to q1 being similar or slightly better than q4 from again on sale point of view david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great appreciate the color guys and then tom whats the outlook on expenses at this point and i know youve occasionally talked about your full year view on expenses in the past if you have any thoughts just on a standalone basis as to what that expense will basically look like thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yes sure dave obviously we came in better than we expected for the year i dont see on a standalone basis any significant uptick in expenses i mean for the year well probably guide around million for the year at that range which is probably conservative but again were very hopeful that as we close flagstar this will be a moot point as were going to be a much larger company but on a standalone basis million is probably a good guide i would say for the first quarter our expenses is usually the high quarter of the year given fica and payroll taxes to million guide for q1 and then coming down in q2 and you can kind of tie out the million for the year david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc perfect and then if youd just give an update on what youre seeing on a new loan yield basis multifamily spec fin that sort of thing and then maybe securities reinvestment rates i know youre not growing the portfolio but as youre sort of maybe stabilizing it just curious where youre buying securities thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 yeah ill give some color on the loan but then ill defer to john pinto on the securities side i will tell you that weve been not really buying any securities at all weve been keeping the powder dry for years so there will be potentially an opportunity depending on market conditions but weve been reluctant to take on duration risk given the current environment i will tell you in the fourth quarter the gyration of the yield curve really i think woke up a lot of our customers so spreads have held in very nicely weve had rates as high as 350ish in the five year and indiscernible so its going to range but that to basis points spread on our core model has been holding very well so obviously we watch the treasury curve every day thats our business model when we tie up as a portfolio lender whats been interesting david is that when you think about the back end of the curve and you look at the choice of a portfolio loan versus an agency loan it looks like agency has been struggling just given the dynamics of the cost of coupon so weve been winning a lot of good business that continues so spreads are holding up very nicely we talked about the anticipation of probably more growth than we anticipated from the previous year going into postcovid this has been a very robust property transaction environment talk to the brokers in the market there are stuff thats transacting that is significant a lot of transactions that are in place right now were seeing some great opportunities our customers have been very proactive leveraging their operating expense base to look at other markets so were choosing to work with our best customers outside of the new york market thats kind of saturated theyre looking at other opportunistic markets and were following them so its good to see some good transactions as we talked about in a cash flow perspective cap rates are relatively stable and the spreads are holding up very nicely so were very ambitious about seeing some good multifamily growth weve been a little bit hesitant on the commercial real estate we havent seen a whole lot of cre business but from time to time well refinance our current customer base on the specialty side we think we have tremendous pentup demand i know in my opening comments we talked about the outstanding commitments in totality were just under billion that business started from zero a few years ago and its been a great business model i think theres opportunity there potentially on the funding side that we hope to deal with over time but were really a credit buy up shop there but ultimately as we merge with flagstar and we take their syndicate division collectively we should be winning our own deals and maybe being a leader and putting the deals together and controlling some of those deposit relationships but were excited about specialty i think specialty had a year of i think we went into the fourth quarter at so that has been a big bump above the jump there i think a lot of it has to do with pentup demand on the supply chain thats going to be big for us in so theres a lot of money thats out there and thats outstanding that hasnt been drawn down yet that can also bode well for additional growth within specialty so excited about the spreads there again mostly floating rate type instruments and on a rising rate environment well benefit from that i think its around of the entire portfolio that we prices with the with rising rates so the bank is somewhat differently positioned now than historically its been as a traditional indiscernible model so we hope that as we get more towards neutrality with flagstar we see asset sensitivity which would be a nice mix in the rising rate environment new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right sounds good thanks guys thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and just on the securities side dave just to go back to that yields are all what they are i mean when they start getting closer to well probably wake up but weve been very quiet on the securities side david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yes okay great thanks operator thank you our next question has come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning pete peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning good morning tom i wanted to ask about credit quality which obviously is always a great story for you guys you had another nice decline in the principal deferral loans im just curious what happens with the remaining like million of deferrals with the cares act getting exhausted in the next few months thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah hey great question we looked at this as we went into the covid19 we had about billion we were very generous and we looked at our cares program cares act program we gave a six months deferral right out of the gate full deferrals many customers came back within a quarter and said we dont need it because theres no change in the nonluxury market people werent exiting their apartments for the nonluxury markets so we went through a very interesting journey during covid and where we stand today it comes alive we should have close to zero because obviously the cares act runs out when you think about that its been a very positive experience of working through the other side for our customers i know in my opening commentary we talked about leaseups what were seeing right now in the cares act thats remaining id say of the percentage of manhattan is probably is that right john or close to of the of whats within ph deferral is manhattan so outside of manhattan its been a very strong recovery there on utilizing the cares act relief program i envision that that well have zero loans on deferral come july maybe june or july of this year at the same time when we think about whats going to happen as far as the pandemic what does it mean for the overall asset quality of the bank we have more than adequate reserves based on cecl and we think were going to probably deal with maybe million of stuff at the end of the day which is pretty good for a billion bank and we have million of npa so were very pleased with the asset quality we had a little snafu last new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 quarter with a customer and it worked itself out like we were very confident were very confident of collateral we are a lowleverage lender as you know the ltv historically are typically lower than the marketplace were a inplace cash flow lender most of our businesses well call it rent stabilized and nonluxury type market in the five boroughs and were very confident that in the event there is a hiccup we have very good collateral to cover ourselves and believe me we tested that in q4 and we came out very strong given our positioning as you can see that relationship became current so were very bullish about where we are on asset quality and part of my discussion points in my opening remarks is that thats part of the rationale on coming out of covid19 this portfolio is very strong peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thats helpful and then just as a followup question can you just give an update on the strategic partnership with figure or does the real benefit really kick in when you close the merger with flagstar and just how youre thinking about it in terms of maybe a potential deposit growth as well thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so yes so let me just be specific were not going to be explicit exactly what were doing with things were doing a lot with figure its a we were working on daily projects we have a lot of interesting things happening as you saw recently im sure you saw the usdf consortium has been formed officially i believe we have five member banks now that are the founding members we happen to be the lead there thats going to be a very interesting view on digital markets via stablecoin usdf fiat currency so we believe that that working group is very powerful as we continue to add more members its an ongoing daily function both at compliance audit legal our entire operating team is spending good efforts on making sure that we work with our regulators to come up with a solution to deal with this opportunity on fiat currency weve data tested multiple occasions on live transactions its been working out very well we just did our interoperability between multiple banks at the same time thats a big plus its the first time its ever happened in the banking industry although its not a material transaction but we did test operability amongst banks to move from mint and burn among each other bank thats a big step towards solving for the usdf at the same time we deal directly with the principal at figure on business use we havent been public specifically of what our business case use will be we have a number of initiatives as you mentioned mortgage we believe on just on the financial transaction side as lee indicated they do a lot of secondary market activity putting that on a blockchain is logical all right its not on the agency side but its on the private level side thats the a very simplistic use of the provenance blockchain via through a relationship with figure technologies thats one of many things that were working on we believe theres going to be opportunity to deal with potentially our customers where they can look at a more efficient way to make bill pay to rental payments ph to a bar this is all part of our longterm plans we havent specifically set out a business case use yet this is an ongoing process but its also a focus the most important focus is to ensure on a regulatory standpoint that we utilize the kyc the bank secrecy view that we know our customers and i think thats the most important aspect of what we have to accomplish here and weve made tremendous progress there pete im not going to give you specific numbers or guidance here i can tell you every day we come up with new best use case ideas its evolving its a technology collaboration with a very strong business in figure and others by the way its not just figure its others that were talking to on technology initiatives we talked about my strategic new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 plan when i became ceo is that we want to digitize the bank this bank has a long way to go on digitization so were spending a lot of time with our partner on fiserv theyve been great as far as a true partnership were doing some good business relationships with them at the same time were also rolling out a tremendous amount of digitalization we believe that my banking direct is going to be another catalyst for the company for another use case of bringing in funding at the consumer side so that could tie into figure technologies as well so a lot of positive things to talk about im not going to be specific until we actually have something to thats live to talk about but i will tell you the energy level is very strong and its fluid peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for all that color tom thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question has come from the line of matthew breese with stephens please proceed with your questions matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning matt hey matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning hey on the flagstar deal you mentioned that the community pledge agreement with the ncrc paves the way for the approval process i guess i want to better understand that comment was there an issue on the cra front or was there regulatory pressure in this area and are there any other roadblocks we should be aware of thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc matt without getting specific i want to be very clear about this this is not unusual for large transactions to embark upon a global credit agreement we took this sandro and i with open arms we hit the ground for running going back to the day after we signed the deal it took a while to get to finalization but no question deals of this nature tend to be tied to some very large community group arrangement i will tell you the importance of it is historic for us given that we are a major force on multifamily lending and this multifamily lending business model will also expand into the markets of flagstar so weve done a lot of great new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 work with anhd over the years to be a responsible multifamily lender a player here and because we are the largest portfolio lender so the importance of this agreement is significant as far as going forward it is important as far as getting our approval because this is something that we worked with our community groups without opposition there was no opposition about us coming together this was a joint effort with sandro and i personally we spent hours on understanding the needs of our community i think whats exciting about it is that we look at this as having the power of flagstars mortgage origination process to actually work with the agency to come up with solutions to better bank communities in need and we think we have some really good initiatives that ultimately we can take this project arrangement into a very powerful industry standard that other banks can utilize to do good for america and we truly believe that this is an exciting time and i will tell you that it was a very fluid process but ultimately we got to the finish line and i truly believe in sandro i dont want to speak for sandro hes on the call i truly believe this will pave the way to where we have to go to get our transaction moving towards the closing as we all know ma has somewhat of an extended time period given the biden executive order that came out in july and it is what it is and we worked with our regulators and we really cant get much into any more than other than that other than were excited to come together and work on a side by side together as a partner with flagstar to get our deal closed matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc and just to answer your specific comment regarding cra flagstar just had an outstanding cra rating so there is no cra issue but certainly getting a agreement of this nature done is an important part of the regulatory approval process matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay the other one just on the regulatory approval process in the deal filings theres several other approvals necessary for the deal including fannie freddie ginnie the department of veterans affairs state of texas and the state of vermont i dont know if ive ever come across a deal requiring those institutions having a say can you just discuss the approval process for these other institutions and how do they compare to the standard kind of fed and fdic state approvals thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i mean maybe lee can i believe we have retained those approvals so maybe lee if you want to expand on where we are with those approvals on the mortgage side lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah no absolutely tom on the mortgage side as it relates to fannie freddie ginnie fha usda va were in good standing there isnt an issue and the reason we need those is nycb is the acquiring entity because all those licenses are in flagstars name at the moment and theyre obviously going to move over to new york community bank theyre all good theyre just waiting on the regulatory approval but theres no issues and new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 thats the reason why were having to take that step with this transaction because theyre all in flagstars name at the moment and nycb is the acquiring entity matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay so to be clear those are more sounds like rubber stamp and does not have the same kind of rigor as the others lee matthew smith a executive vice president presidentmortgage flagstar bancorp inc yeah pretty i would say thats mostly right but its not just a rubber stamp i mean there was a lot of work questions that we needed to answer and there was a lot of work that the team speak behind the scenes so its a little bit more than a rubber stamp but probably not as onerous as the regulatory approvals matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay understood the last one for me just going back to the figure partnership earlier this month you did a bank to bank digital market transaction and i would assume over time theres more and more of these both kind of customer to customer within the bank and then across depository institutions as well are there any fee income benefits as these transactions take place if so could you outline that and then todate have you seen any encouraging signs on the deposit front from this technology thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so we havent yet put out a business a public business case use of the fee income that we would generate as part of the consortium and as the bank that will be housing hopefully a substantial amount of deposits tied to the activity but clearly thats part of our business plan as we develop it its not a public plan yet again its in beta testing we mentioned that we did an operability thats going to continue with the other banks as well they all have to make sure that they that have joined the consortium are doing the same type of technical awareness on how they could mint and burn collectively within each others platform and then and have that position in place so yes weve done one we intend to do more testing as we move forward here but i believe that ultimately as this takes on more energy and other banks enthusiasm towards joining the consortium we feel therell be a lot more banks looking to be part of this as a solution for what were dealing with with the system which is a substantial amount of activity thats not currently housed in the banking system right so going back to kyc its going to go through our system we own the kyc behind knowing the customers in and out transactions on fiat currency that is where i believe real value will be disseminated through the usdf and at the same time each bank will have its own business case use for how they look at the provenance blockchain depending on their business model so its evolving matt i apologize nothing specific but as you know we have a lot of excitement this is a technology build out with a substantial amount of regulatory dialogue that has to be done right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood i appreciate it thats all i had thank you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question come from the line of chris marinac with janney please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning tom could you or sandro just update us on how quickly you can integrate the back office once you get approval and has that time sort of narrowed at all just because of this interim time since the announcement thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc chris its a great point and im glad we have sandro and lee on the call because theyve been indiscernible working together for years now but we do have separate companies and its a lot to get to know each other i think the most important aspect of a deal of this nature is culture right so my job is to ensure that the culture is aligned at the same time were working with our teams independently because were not one company yet to truly understand the opportunity of putting these cultures together so its culture thats going to be key and thats my number one priority for the bank is to ensure that the culture is aligned properly sandro is the ambassador of culture for flagstar hes done an amazing job under his leadership and im spending lots of time with sandro and i believe that the teams together are doing a phenomenal job unfortunately we havent closed yet so our focus was the third quarter of last year and now were in the first quarter and were very optimistic but thats not in our control we work real hard to get this deal done as soon as we practically can but at the same time a day doesnt go by where were not working on culture indiscernible leadership at flagstar and leadership at nycb can manage the longterm integration stream were working with thirdparty consultants to help bridge the gap there and were geared up for a cultural integration thats the most important aspect so this is going to be a very large mortgage concern as well that we have to ensure that we can ph cross sell product and initiatives and make sure that people are aligned in the culture so i dont know maybe sandro wants to add some color to that but i think thats the focus for the two banks alessandro p dinello a president chief executive officer director flagstar bancorp inc sure yeah first let me say that with respect to legal day one were ready for legal day one so once the final regulatory approval comes forth well be ready to go pretty quickly with the closing and be able to operate as a combined company pretty quickly now in terms of taking advantage of complete integration and conversion obviously as you suggested that takes time and a lot of that you cant quite get ready for it until you get to legal new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2022 day one so i dont think when you look at the conversion of the systems that the time necessarily narrows because of the length of time it takes to get a regulatory approval however and i will say as relates to being ready with lets say marketing plans or for bringing new products into the new york community bank branch offices i think it does give us the ability to be a little bit better prepared for that and hit the ground running but in terms of totally narrowing the integration timeline between legal day one and complete conversion im not sure theres a great amount of narrowing that takes place because of the timeframe related to the regulatory approval and then with respect to culture tom is absolutely right were two different companies but were trying to bring our people together getting them to know each other and thats maybe more important that a lot of people realize relative to the success of a company because the more that your people care about the company the better performance they will be and therefore the better results your company will have and we are through our diversity equity and inclusion program at flagstar bringing new york community bank people into those events whenever we can and the way that they have embraced it has really been fantastic christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you both for that background its really helpful and thanks for all the information this morning thomas robert cangemi a chairman president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over
