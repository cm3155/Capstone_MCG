now hand over to george elhedery group chief executive georges elhedery group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you louise hello everyone thank you for joining today im here with jon bingham our group financial controller whos acting as interim group chief financial officer we delivered another good quarter which shows that our strategy is working and we have a strong platform for growth i am committed to building on that before jon takes you through the third quarter numbers id like to make a few comments we made several announcements last week first pam kaur will take over as group chief financial officer with effect from 1st of january pam is an exceptional leader who joined hsbc in as group head of audit and is currently our group chief risk and compliance officer with almost years experience in the financial sector she brings a global perspective to the strategic challenges and opportunities we face today i look forward to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 partnering with her for the next stage of the banks growth and development i would also like to thank jon for his outstanding support during the interim period second we announced a reorganization to simplify and streamline the group were currently organized around three businesses in five regions from the 1st of january we will operate through four businesses hong kong and the uk serving personal banking and commercial banking customers in our two home markets corporate and institutional banking and international wealth and premier banking we will also streamline our geographic governance structures reducing them from five regions to two further enhancing our ability to serve our customers needs throughout our global network our current group executive committee of members will be replaced by a new group operating committee with members the analysis weve done so far demonstrates that the reorganization will result in net cost savings with a relatively short payback period on any upfront costs we will share these details with you at our fullyear results in february as part of a wider business update and third turning to the external environment i welcome the clarity provided by the uk government on its prudential rules the pras second near final policy statement and rules on the implementation of basel bring an end to years of uncertainty and will help the banking sector to support growth in the uk similarly i am encouraged by the recent policy measures in mainland china and in hong kong im confident that the monetary stimulus announced last month and potential further fiscal and other measures will help to stabilize key sectors and strengthen mainland chinas economy meanwhile hong kongs easing of macroprudential constraints is proportionate and timely and we expect these measures to have a positive impact on the hong kong economy with that jon will take you through the q3 numbers jon jonathan bingham interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc thanks george in summary we had another good quarter profit before tax of billion was up billion or on the third quarter of last year on a constant currency basis this brings our annualized return on tangible equity for the first nine months of the year to or excluding notable items revenue of billion was up billion on last years third quarter and up billion on the second quarter this year underlying the good momentum within the business weve announced today a further billion of distributions consisting of a third interim dividend of per share and a new share buyback of up to billion we intend to complete this buyback during the fourmonth period before our fullyear results announcement in february last week we also completed the share buyback announcement at the halfyear results in july weve now repurchased of our share count since the start of last year as you can see on the next slide strategic transactions principally the disposal of canada in the first quarter were a small impact on the yearonyear revenue and profit growth excluding this impact of these transactions profit before tax excluding notable items was up on the third quarter of last year revenue of billion was up billion on the third quarter of last year driven by a billion increase in fee and other income this included a billion increase in wholesale transaction banking and wealth the remaining billion increase primarily reflected strong performance in equities and global debt markets with hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 global banking and markets and adverse items in the third quarter of last year that did not repeat including billion of treasury disposal losses and other notable items banking nii of billion was down billion on the second quarter on a reported fx basis primarily due to a loss arising from the early redemption of legacy securities excluding this the banking nii run rate was stable on the previous quarter our banking nii guidance is unchanged at around billion our guidance includes the impact of the billion early redemption loss taken this quarter it also assumes a billion contribution from argentina this year which is what we reported in argentina has contributed billion to banking nii in the yeartodate but the volatility created by hyperinflation accounting makes that number very difficult to forecast from quarter to quarter accordingly i would encourage you to think of our guidance as being around billion excluding argentina turning to fee and other income wholesale transaction banking was up on last years third quarter the key driver was global foreign exchange which grew benefiting from an increased client activity higher volumes also contributed to growth in both global trade solutions and global payments solutions wealth was up on the third quarter last year it was our third consecutive quarter of doubledigit growth in wealth as our continued investments in this business and the importance of hong kong as a global wealth hub have enabled us to capitalize on a favorable operating environment there was doubledigit growth in all wealth products but life insurance was the biggest driver about half of the growth in life insurance was from the non repetition of a charge we took in q3 last year excluding that life insurance still grew well into double digits mainly because a higher csm balance drove an increase in csm release the csm balance is a store of value all else remaining equal growth in the balance means growth in future earnings and our csm balance continue to grow in the first three quarters of this year weve generated more than billion of new business csm this has driven our csm balance to billion a increase since last years third quarter creating a foundation for future revenue growth hong kong continue to benefit from inflows of international customers there were newtobank customers in the third quarter versus an average of just over per quarter in the first half net new invested assets were billion in the quarter billion of which were in asia on credit youll recall that our second quarter had a low ecl charge due to recoveries and other items the third quarter ecl charge was billion or basis points of average loans the wholesale ecl charge was billion driven by billion in hong kong of which billion related to hong kong commercial real estate whilst the personal charge was billion this brings our annualized ecl charge to basis points of average loans for the yeartodate which is broadly in line with our to basis point guidance for the full year next on costs costs were up in the first nine months of the year on a target basis which was lower than for the first half as we explained in the previous quarter the phasing of performancerelated pay and the additional levies from the end of last year will give us a tailwind heading into the fourth quarter were on track to meet our target of around cost growth for on a target basis and remain committed to cost discipline on lending and deposits loan balances were stable in the third quarter deposits were up driven by a billion increase in hong kong wpb this reflected shortterm flows between invested assets and deposits and id hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 caution you against annualizing that number term deposits were of total hong kong deposits unchanged since the second quarter next our cet1 ratio was up basis points on the second quarter as strong organic capital generation was partly offset by distributions cet1 grew billion during the quarter on a constant currency basis this growth included billion of other movements mainly gains in the market value of securities classified as held tocollectandsell which are fair valued through other comprehensive income rwas grew by billion on a constant currency basis mainly due to broader balance sheet growth finally id like to point out a number of upcoming events which will help you with your modeling first we expect the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around percentage points on our cet1 ratio in the fourth quarter it remains our intention to return excess capital to shareholders through a rolling series of share buybacks secondly we expect to complete the sale of hsbc argentina in the fourth quarter as a reminder around billion of historical foreign exchange translation and other reserve losses will be recycled to the income statement on completion this has already been recognized in capital and there will be no incremental impact on cet1 tnav or distributions these losses will also be excluded from our dividend calculation we expect the completion of the sale to reduce rwas by around billion equivalent to around percentage points of cet1 third we intend to begin to actively market our billion legacy french home loan portfolio during the fourth quarter we expect to reclassify this portfolio as heldtocollectandsell in the first quarter next year leading to a recognition of an estimated billion pretax loss equivalent to around percentage points of cet1 finally the pra recently published near final rules on basel these are incrementally better than we previously expected we continue to expect them to have an immaterial impact on our cet1 ratio upon implementation to conclude our guidance remains unchanged namely a midteens return on tangible equity excluding notable items for and banking nii of around billion in ecls for the full year within our normal mediumterm planning range of to basis points cost growth of around for on a target basis and midsingledigit loan growth over the medium term with that louise can we hand over to qa hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you jon operator instructions our first question today comes from andrew coombs at citigroup please accept the prompt to unmute your line georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hello andrew andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning and good afternoon for those in hong kong two questions please one firstly just on the reorg and strategy a very simple question given the new structure where does that leave mexico so any thoughts on mexico would be appreciated and secondly on the financials themselves on that nonnii strength where fees and other income were up yearonyear and youve highlighted you now had three consecutive quarters of doubledigit growth and previously if i go back to your investor day in you took that highsingledigit growth for asian wealth specifically youre clearly running well ahead of that and consistently running well ahead of that so to what extent do you think we can extrapolate that doubledigit growth into future quarters in next year thank you georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you andrew im going to take your first question about mexico and jon will address the second one so andrew we have a good market position in mexico we have a good performance in mexico our wholesale business in mexico is in a particular strength in our global network of connectivity its very strongly connected with our north american business its equally very strongly connected with our asiapacific business and therefore is a key strategic anchor stone for our customers our retail business in mexico will form part of the new business segment of international wealth and personal banking as you know all our personal banking businesses outside the hong kong and uk our two home markets will be part of the international wealth and premier banking business which will be focused on growing the affluent segment in the market and creating a strategic differentiation for us in the market where we operate in the personal banking space outside home markets jon will take the second question jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc andrew as you know weve been investing in our wealth capabilities for some time wealth was up year onyear in third quarter and yearonyear for the nine months that growth was particularly driven in asia where we see a favorable operating environment but we are seeing broadbased growth across the main segments thats supported by strong customer growth and growth in net new invested assets so we have guided previously to highsingledigit growth i think its fair that we may well outperform that in the short term hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you andrew operator thank you our next question comes from aman rakkar at barclays please accept the prompt to unmute your line aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning and good afternoon thanks very much for the presentation and the questions yeah i had a question on one on restructuring and one on net interest income please just trying to scope the degree of ambition that you might have around restructuring it looks like efforts to restructure the business are focused on delivering net cost saves youre clearly doing very well on revenues at the moment particularly the fee business is presumably a source of nearterm upside to market expectations but i think the outlook is volatile a lot of these things are outside of your area of control so what is the scale of the ambition around what youd be looking to achieve on things like costs and indeed rwas as you try and kind of futureproof the mediumterm return on tangible equity outlook and then i had a second question on net interest income so i think the im taking the kind of banking nii guide at face value and trying to nix out argentina and i think its implying a kind of annualized run rate of around billion at the fourth quarter as a jumpingoff point into maybe a bit of a low value question but interested if you were able to at this stage just to comment on banking net interest income as per consensus in i think the streets at around billion so versus that billion not looking for too much attrition from here itd be great to get if youre not willing to put a number on it well how you see the moving parts out there please thank you very much georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you aman for the two questions again im going to address your first question on the reorganization and jon can take us through the nii elements so aman the primary reason for the reorganization is to create a simpler more dynamic more agile leaner bank its really to allow us to empower our frontline staff and make it faster to make decisions and ultimately serve our customers better thats the primary reason now as a result of a simpler leaner more efficient bank there will be cost saves the costs takeout will be essentially in the form of severance or related cost it will be affecting senior roles that will be deduplicated or the reduction of the number of senior roles will drive this we will be giving you those details about the figures about the upfront costs as well as the benefits realization in the fullyear results in february what i can say is number one the benefits will exceed the upfront costs and the payback is going to happen in a short timeframe thereafter and then the second point to share with you is that we remain fully committed to cost discipline ive been sharing this in my days as group cfo i carry on this mission of being fully committed to cost discipline and this is now embedded in the firm as you have seen from our q3 results for we remain on track to deliver on our cost target we are committed to it and were confident we will be able to achieve it jon hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc so on banking nii thanks for the question aman if i might be forgiven for giving you a slightly longer answer to those so if we start on weve reiterated our guidance on of banking nii of around billion but encourage you to think about that as billion exargentina in total weve printed billion for the nine months to date and we think the q3 run rate of billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about modeling we dont provide guidance at this stage on banking nii guidance but if you take that clean run rate of the billion which i agree just about billion well have disposed of argentina so therefore we then think of the building blocks for you to model this along four factors firstly rates the reduction in rates implied in markets will be clearly a headwind the cuts during the third quarter given the timing ph of there then they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarters results but wed encourage you to use our banking nii sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that component we then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind weve got the reinvestment of maturing positions that will enable us to reinvest them at higher rates weve signaled that for weve got billion maturing at an average yield of about so think about those maturing and being placed at something along the lines of fiveyear bond rates we then got volume growth whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in we do hope that with interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up that we will see more loan growth we continue to guide to midsingle digits in the medium to long term the timing of getting there will be unpredictable and then lastly we keep an eye on time deposit migration that has been relatively stable particularly in hong kong at over the last couple of quarters but the impact on that as rates come off will be variable it depends on competitive pressures and customer behavior so all of those factors is how we have thought about it and modeled it and included that within our midteens rote guidance for thanks aman georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you aman aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you could i have just one followup and thanks very much for that really detailed answer in relation to the midteens rote aspiration next year does that include or exclude any potential kind of upfront costs as part of any restructuring jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc so the midteens rote guidance is excluding notable items we will come back to you in february with full details of the benefits and costs of the reorganization hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you aman operator our next question today comes from james invine at redburn please accept the prompt to unmute your line james invine q analyst redburn europe ltd hi good morning to you both or good evening ive got two please the first is on the wealth business so clearly just some really good revenue numbers i was just wondering if you could kind of explain the slight disconnect with the net new invested asset number in asia which certainly was positive but probably not quite as positive as i might have expected given how good the revenue line was and then second could you just share your thoughts about the outlook for corporate loan growth across asia so and in fact loan growth more generally across asia so i think in the second quarter we saw both hong kong and kind of exhong kong fall slightly but i think three months ago noel was sounding a bit more positive at least on hong kong also weve had the announcements in china about a month ago so just where do we go from here on the asia loan volumes georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you james im going to share some thoughts on your two questions and ill ask jon to go into more details about both of them first our wealth business as youve seen in this quarters exhibited doubledigit returns this is the third quarter in a row with similar type returns wealth business as you know is generated from four segments one of which has performed quite well which is the trading activities of our customers and that manifests both in the private bank as well as in our invested assets they have been very strong and theyve been even stronger following the measures weve seen in china on the outlook for corporate loan growth in asia as i shared earlier we are very encouraged by the policy measures that have taken place both in mainland china as well as in hong kong we see these measures combined with the outlook on rates coming down as supportive of future growth specifically in our hong kong book and outside hong kong the rest of asia remains resilient southeast asia and south asia remain quite strong in terms of loan growth although of course a different size in our books than hong kong jon jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc so just to amplify your comments on wealth so weve seen good growth in wealth we see the net new invested assets were very pleased with that in asia theyve grown by billion in the quarter and billion over the nine months you will see some movements as we grow our wealth franchise we also had billion of deposits which george talked about well see also deposits increase they will ultimately feed into the wealth share of wallets that weve gotten so continue to be encouraged hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 on corporate loan growth nothing more to add than georges comments thanks georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you james james invine q analyst redburn europe ltd thank you operator our next question today comes from kunpeng ma at china securities please accept the prompt to unmute your line kunpeng ma q analyst china securities co ltd hey good morning george good morning jon this is kunpeng with china securities thank you for taking my question i got one question on transaction banking because we have seen a slight recovery in the transaction banking income in the third quarter but i think thats maybe driven by the fx volatilities but going forward maybe we can see more rate cuts going forward and we can maybe were going to see continued fx volatilities going forward so could you please give me a little bit more color on the future outlook of the transaction banking income if you could comment on both nii and nonnii thats going to be quite appreciated thank you georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you kunpeng ill ask jon to comment on this area where as youve heard us saying an area of strategic differentiation for us for our wholesale customers and where we keep investing and do expect continued growth in the space given our investments and our leadership in this space jon jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc yeah so weve been pleased by the growth in wholesale transaction banking in the quarter up as you say an element of that is clientdriven activity around fx and rates volatility but within that we continue to invest in global trade solutions and global payments on global trade solutions we continue to grow our market share in both hong kong and the uk and so as that market comes back there is the opportunity for us to that be a platform for our growth similarly youll see us to continue to invest in global payments solutions and we see a very optimistic path for the payment markets going forward thank you georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you kunpeng operator thank you our next question today comes from amit goel at mediobanca please accept the prompt to unmute your line hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 amit goel q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom hi thank you two questions from me one just coming back on the simplification program just curious i guess in the past the group hasnt opted to combine commercial banking and gbm so just curious whats kind of seen as different now which makes this more feasible and easy to execute with less maybe revenue attrition ph or up for consideration and then secondly just on the ecl charges those were a little bit higher than what i anticipated it looks like a bit of thats from hong kong wholesale and the uk ringfenced bank so just curious if theres any kind of additional color you can provide on that and how youre thinking about the kind of bps in the context of the guidance into next year thank you georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you amit let me address your first question and jon can address the ecl charges question so the primary reason of this reorganization is to simplify the bank as we shared but we have been on a multiyear journey to simplify the activities we do in the bank weve been exiting activities that were nonstrategic weve been reshaping our portfolio weve exited markets or activities currently were on track to complete the sale of our argentina business and our armenia business and announced two additional exits in september including south africa as well as the private bank in germany now that activity was addressing the what in terms of what we do as a strategy the reorganization we have announced last week is basically addressing the how we execute our strategy its not changing the what its changing the how and the reason we could effectively execute the how we change our strategy as in be simpler more agile is because of the work we have done over the past few years in simplifying the what we do so there is a it is the right time now to address how we operate how we execute our strategy because weve simplified what we do weve clarified what our core strategic areas for us where we have competitive strength and where we have leadership and opportunities to grow so the timing therefore is a natural kind of conclusion of the various activities that we have been taking through the transformation over the last five years i want to say that outside the uk and hong kong where were merging all our commercial banking activities with global banking and markets activities to form the corporate and institutional bank it will comprise our core products including our balance sheetrelated products credit and lending and deposits our transaction banking products as well as our other products such as investment banking or markets and this should give our customers a more seamless way to deal with hsbc across all this product spectrum that we offer them jon jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc so thanks amit ill give you a bit more color on the ecl charges a billion charge in third quarter which is basis points of average loans thats actually a more normal charge because q2 benefited from releases and recoveries if you then dissect the third quarter charge theres three things within there so firstly the uk which is billion charge again that benefited from the release it releases in the second quarter its a more normal charge theres nothing more going on in there hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 hong kong in total we incurred a billion charge as you say that was mainly billion charge in wholesale which included billion of mainland china cre and billion of hong kong cre the rest of it was across a number of sectors again nothing of particular note and then relative to third quarter last year we did have an increase in our mexico retail charge so that went up to billion charge thats actually been relatively normal through the quarters of but relative to third quarter is a little higher so were confident as we see this that we will be in our to basis points planning range over the medium term and certainly there for georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you amit operator our next question today comes from gurpreet singh sahi from goldman sachs please accept the prompt to unmute your line gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thank you for taking my question and congratulations on a good set of numbers i have two and mostly follow ups first is on wealth and then well move to hong kong cre on wealth can i check with the socalled policy rescue in china only a month old and for this reporting quarter maybe only a week so have we seen like from august as we transitioned into september good wealth management income traction better than what we are reporting in the third quarter and then in october that continued maybe it even accelerated so some color there would be helpful and then on hong kong cre specifically not talking about hong kong in general can we get numbers on the npl ratio within the overall global cre book and also the hong kong cre book as at the half year we were at stage loans in both thank you very much georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you gurpreet let me just briefly address wealth and ill ask jon to complement it and address your hong kong cre question so there are two trends in wealth there is the underlying trend which is a continued growth in our wealth business which has been there quarter after quarter its a result of both our increased investment in this space its a result of us winning market share given our brand and franchise its also a result of the underlying market growing as youve seen hong kong is now expected to become the largest private wealth hub in the world by the end of the decade so that is definitely a trend and were privileged with our position in hong kong to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers from it that is the first component which is an underlying continued investment and growth trend you add to that obviously the additional activity weve seen following the measures that have been taken in china this has created additional activity which has been as you said for a week or so in the third quarter we do see this activity continuing and obviously normalizing but we do see these measures that have been taken to be supportive measures certainly of the economy at large but in particular supportive measures of the financial markets and the revival of some of the financial market sluggishness that weve seen both in mainland china and hong kong over the last few quarters jon hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc so if i pick up your second point on hong kong cre its actually a very similar picture to that we described at the second quarter so a few customers continue to face cash flow pressures some of that is rates resultant and as rates come off we would hope that begins to abate some of those cash flow pressures if you look at the asia wholesale stage they were up billion in the quarter some of that relates to hong kong cre that also drove a modest amount of additional rwas the ecls on that weve referred to the fact that there was million charge on ecls that was both across stage and stage the stage ratio is slightly up quarter on quarter but we continue to see good collateral across that portfolio and so we dont see this as a material ecl driver going forward our focus is really on supporting our customers through this period as theres pressures we should see start to reduce as rates recede georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah and as we said gurpreet we are confident about the outlook of the hong kong economy at large and the hong kong commercial real estate sector in particular partly because of the rates receding as jon was just mentioning but also partly due to the policy measures and the countercyclical measures that have been taken this month to support the sector we see these as having positive developments for the outlook of the market thank you very much gurpreet operator our next question today comes from jeremy hou at cicc please accept the prompt to unmute your line dekai hou q analyst china international capital corp ltd good morning george good morning jon georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc morning dekai hou q analyst china international capital corp ltd my first question is on the structural hedge i think george you mentioned that billion is a good run rate for you indiscernible to build up the structural hedge in the second half but in q3 that increased by billion and maybe most of that comes from fx impact so do you still stick to a billion run rate or you would like to accelerate it and the second question is on i would like to hear your thoughts on what area hsbc can further make investments because it feels like over the years our strategy always emphasized that the bank had to make excellent good cost discipline and we did it and we made some investments but mostly small ones so if we look forward do you see any opportunities that may help us to further drive growth and take market share or do you think its better to stay cautious as we are still facing some top line pressures thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you jeremy let me address your second question on investments and then jon can address your structural hedge question so first as you said cost discipline ive taken it from my role my days in my cfo role with me as ceo it is embedded in the organization and we will maintain cost discipline you should expect this to be ingrained in the way we think spending wisely and in the right places in terms of strategy in the reorganization we announced last week we are basically organizing ourselves alongside our strategic pillars so this creates clarity and this also creates simplicity in the way we can execute our strategy we have two home markets where we have scale a leading market position and great growth opportunities and certainly very strong competitive edge in our corporate and institutional banking business we have a global connectivity capability and a transaction banking capability that is second to none that is very leading and providing excellent services to our customers our positioning is very cherished and very valued by our customers and then we have wealth and premier banking which is really the proposition aimed at the affluent segment for investment needs in particular across our network and in particular also in asia and the middle east any opportunity we have to accelerate this strategy be it organic or inorganic is an opportunity we will go after we are looking these areas all exhibit fantastic growth opportunities we have a real competitive edge and we will continuously invest in them both organically and inorganically if the opportunities arise what i should say there is we do have the capital to support our needs we have the capital to support obviously our dividend distribution to support organic growth and to support inorganic opportunities should we find some that can accelerate our strategy and allow us to gain market share jon jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc jeremy if i pick up your question on structural hedge as you rightly say we have increased our structural hedge during the period from billion at the 30th of june to billion at the 30th of september but that was mostly fx driven the duration of that remains years we would continue to expect to increase our structural hedge but that will depend on market conditions that we have and i would say that the big increases of our structural hedge are probably behind us so further increases from here will only have a modest impact on our banking nii sensitivity thanks jeremy georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you jeremy operator our next question comes from katherine lei at jpmorgan please accept the prompt to unmute your line katherine lei q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd hi thanks george and thanks jon so my questions will be two the first one i would like to ask about nii i think the confusing thing here is that i think the headline nii actually slightly missed the expectation but if we work out the banking nii theres a moderate beat and also we try to calculate what is the banking net interest hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 margin it seems its by and large stable despite in however actually went down kind of on average basis points so may i ask like what is driving that stable net interest margin would it be from the liabilities management side i mean just now jon gave us some color in terms of like say deposit migration but is that possible to give me some give us some like numbers to work around like what is the casa ratio in hong kong and how the trend has changed so this will be my first questions my second question is that when i look at the rwa migration i saw on the on numerator i saw that in the migration side and there is a billion addition to cet1 capital due to movement in reserves can we get a bit of how to say color on that ones will we be seeing some kind of movement like similar type of movement in the coming quarters actually i have one slight additional questions is on the loss that we were talking about the legacy securities can you give us a bit of color on this one and understand that management put this into notable items or supposedly to be oneoff but is it really oneoff in nature will we have other securities perpetual bonds that we would like to redeem in the future like say for example do we have another type of perpetual bond currently in our book that we may be looking to redeem it when opportunities arise thank you georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you katherine im going to let jon answer the three questions but allow me one comment on the legacy securities we have said that we will look at our legacy securities continuously but we will take action that are accretive or neutral we will not take action on legacy securities that are detrimental to our investors and our shareholders in this case weve taken an action on a legacy security that has a more than coupon that could be naturally and easily replaced with much lower rates and therefore there is a positive impact on the net present value basis of the actions weve taken and these actions we will always look at where there is value in it jon jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc yeah so thanks katherine three questions there so if i start on your net interest margin we give some detail on the net interest margin on page of the slide deck but effectively the net interest margin has moved from to theres three things driving that one the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities as youve mentioned two some argentina volatility and then the remaining is on weve allocated more funding to the trading book and as you know that will be a drag on net interest income but also an equal and opposite benefit on nonnet interest income so our preferred measure and the way that we think about it is through the banking nii lens there youll see that our clean run rate exargentina and ex the notables has been relatively stable period on period reflecting the fact that the q3 rate cuts had given their timing had a modest impact on q3 youd also asked about deposit migration weve again got some detail in that on slide but that has remained relatively stable at for the hong kong deposits if i move on to your cet1 question and then particularly the change in other adjustments for cet1 capital that is around the fair value movements of our securities that are classified as fair value through oci so weve generated a gain on those which has given us also a capital benefit on that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 i think on legacy security george has covered most of the questions on that but were not signaling anything at this stage around further legacy securities redemptions thank you katherine georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you katherine operator our final question today comes from edward firth at kbw please accept the prompt to unmute your line edward firth q analyst kbw yeah morning everybody and thanks for taking the questions i just have two questions one was just a clarification just to be clear the billion increase in stage loans in hong kong is that all cre just to be clear on that that was the first question the second one is weve obviously got a us election coming up in the next couple of weeks and i just wondered if you could give us some thoughts from your perspective in terms of the possible sort of risks and opportunities that you see that could come out of that i guess with the two realistic options and i guess just related to that there was a lot of press comment that your reorganization was driven by splitting up the asian and i guess the uk or developed markets businesses is that actually right or was that just sort of idle speculation from journalists great thanks so much georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thank you ed let me take your second and third questions and jon can address the stage question so look this is a matter for the us electorate to choose their president im not going to speculate or comment we will see the outcomes on the 5th of november but what is important for us is that we serve our customers we have been serving our customers through various well through an evolving set of rules and regulations on the global scale we serve them for their needs especially for their crossborder needs where were unique at being able to do so we obviously comply with all rules and regulations we will make sure that our customers are able to comply with all rules and regulations insofar that their financial needs are concerned and any new rules and regulations which may come with any new administration are things that we will obviously comply with and support our customers to comply with what i can say though is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers crossborder needs this is one of our unique areas of competitive edge and this remains unchanged and our customer needs remain broad based and global and we will continue supporting them on that mission and with regards the reorganization this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation as has been speculated by some splitting of the asia business or et cetera absolutely not this is a simplification of the bank where we today govern our self through five regions and were bringing this regional setup down to two that is part of the simplification hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2024 it is also meant to help us speed up the buildout of what is a very promising corridor between the middle east and asia were seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years our customers across both middle east and asia are looking for opportunities of trade and investments between them and weve been we have a leading we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor that simplification should also help speed up the build of that corridor and i remind you in our western geographies now were essentially a wholesale bank we have sold our retail banking activities in france weve sold the mass retail activities in the us weve sold the bank in canada weve sold the bank in greece we are in the process of selling the bank in argentina and with that well be left with what is essentially a corporate and institutional banking business that also bring some simplification aspects to the way we govern our self in this region these are the reasons why we did the simplification of the organization we announced last week jon edward firth q analyst kbw great okay jonathan bingham a interim group chief financial officer global financial controller hsbc holdings plc on your cre question ed so of the billion increase in asia wholesale stage most of that was hong kong cre the picture is very similar to how we described it at the second quarter we could see more migrations into stage until interest rates begin to ease the cash flow pressures in those businesses but given the collateral levels that we have against that portfolio we dont see that as a major driver of ecl risk going forward and we are focused on supporting our customers through this transition period thanks ed edward firth q analyst kbw great thanks so much georges elhedery a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you very much ed operator that ends todays qa
