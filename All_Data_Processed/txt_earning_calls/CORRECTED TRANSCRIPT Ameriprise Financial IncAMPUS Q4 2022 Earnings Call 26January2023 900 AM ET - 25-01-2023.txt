james m cracchiolo chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good morning everyone and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call as you saw in our release ameriprise delivered a strong fourth quarter completing an excellent year in we continue to navigate uncertainty and serve our clients exceptionally well ill give you an update on the business and then walter will discuss our financials let me start with the market environment equity markets were down yearoveryear with the average equity markets down sequentially so far this year were starting to see markets rebound to some extent as inflation eases however inflation is still at a high level the question is will the fed have to continue to raise rates a bit more or will they maintain higher rates for longer if inflation remains stickier with that backdrop ameriprise continues to be in a strong position revenues were good at billion only down from a year ago relating to the impact of the equity and fixed income markets earnings were up nicely with eps up for the quarter and for the year both new records and roe continued to be excellent among the best in the industry importantly were also managing expenses well with total expenses down compared to a year ago assets under management and administration were down to trillion largely driven by the steep decline in equity markets lower fixed income markets and a difficult foreign currency translation and asset management as in previous quarters our combination of businesses generates a consistent level of free cash flow and good returns across market cycles were able to consistently invest in the business which is strengthening our competitive position and our ability to deliver differentiated results now ill talk more about our businesses in advice wealth management we continue to deliver very strong results and build on our leadership positions we had good client flows in the quarter as clients remained engaged working closely with their advisors and benefiting from our comprehensive advice and solutions total client flows for the quarter were more than billion which is very strong and in fact the second highest quarter we had and just below our record fourth quarter last year and ill highlight that client flows were a record for the year at nearly billion with the investment climate this year weve seen an even split into the mix of flows into advisory and nonadvisory accounts which is appropriate in this environment were maintaining an appropriate level of cash balances with good growth in our certificate business and the ameriprise bank which is a key growth area for us ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 with regard to the bank weve been consistently investing to expand our capabilities the bank provides important flexibility in this interest rate environment and enables us to further engage and deepen our relationships with clients our bank has grown more than this year to nearly billion we have good growth in our pledged loan business and were on track to launch more deposit and lendingbased products this year our certificate company has also grown to nearly billion up billion for the year clearly was a very challenging year for investors to navigate the market volatility thats why our high level of engagement and advice is so important clients highlight the positive experience theyre having with ameriprise and our advisors and that satisfaction leads to a strong level of trust which were being recognized for and just recently we ranked number two for trust in in forresters new financial services customer trust index and that complements our newsweek rating as one of americas most trusted companies last year lets look at advisor productivity which also remained strong up to nearly per advisor in a challenging market environment one of the reasons our advisors are so productive is the level of support and tools we provide were making important investments including our branding marketing and integrated technology were helping advisors engage clients really well and driving growth in their practices and for the fourth consecutive year ameriprise was recognized by jd power for providing outstanding customer service experience for phone support for advisors turning to recruiting we had another good quarter with highly productive advisors joining the firm advisors are attracted to our value proposition and the strength and stability of the firm and the pipeline looks good so overall we are consistently investing in the business including the bank which is helping to drive organic growth and continue to generate strong results advice wealth management continue to drive the firms results with earnings up yearoveryear now lets turn to retirement protection solutions where earnings were up in the quarter due to the improved rate environment and our ability to invest out as part of our strategy we focused on products that meet our risk tolerances overall sales were down consistent with the industry were very much focused on variable annuities without living benefits our structured products of variable universal life and di products given our move away from fixed products this business is very stable and delivers a very good cash flow and returns id note that riversource was recently ranked as one of the most profitable life insurers now ill cover asset management was a tough year when navigating the volatility as we focus on our clients and execute our strategic priorities similar to the industry our asset management business faced significant headwinds due to markets depreciating in the us and globally which pressured earnings equity markets were down with this assets under management were down to billion driven by market declines as well as a negative fx impact overall flows in the quarter were billion out that included billion of legacy insurance partner outflows in retail overall we were in net outflows of billion including reinvested dividends which were driven by the weak market conditions that both pressured gross sales and increased redemptions in addition in the us we believe there was a heightened level of tax loss selling in december ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 turning to global institutional we were in net inflows of billion excluding legacy insurance partners with some nice wins in ldi strategies with regard to investment performance we continue to have solid three five and year numbers however we have weakness in 1year numbers given market volatility in asset management we are maintaining our expense discipline while continuing to invest in longterm priorities they include our investment research alternatives responsible investment globalizing our operations and bmo integration which is on track we have a strong lineup of products and capabilities a clear focus on serving our clients and as the environment improves we will be well situated overall ameriprise is in a position of strength entering and were very much focused on engaging our clients and continuing to execute well in this environment and with the strength and diversification of our business including the growth of the bank we continue to be able to invest across the firm while continuing to return capital to shareholders at a differentiated level in the fourth quarter alone we returned million to shareholders ill turn it over to walter and then well take your questions walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim results this quarter were very strong and we continue to demonstrate the strength of the ameriprise value proposition adjusted eps increased to in the quarter and increased for the full year our diversified business mix supports good performance across market cycles which was certainly demonstrated in the quarter fundamentals and wealth management particularly in its cash businesses were very strong in total wealth management now represents of adjusted operating earnings up from a year ago asset management like the industry is facing substantial headwinds and earnings from this segment declined in the quarter and the retirement protection solution sic solutions business continues to generate solid financial results and free cash flow we remain focused on the aspects of the business that we can control we are executing our priorities including investing for profitable business growth expanding the bank and completing the integration of bmo all while meeting and exceeding client needs and maintaining a disciplined approach to managing expenses in fact total expenses excluding bmo were flat for the year our balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remains strong in the quarter we returned million of capital to shareholders totaling billion for the full year while continuing to grow the bank and certificate company we have dedicated significant capital to grow these businesses lets turn to slide as you would expect in these markets assets under management and administration ended the quarter at trillion down this was driven by depreciating markets with equity and fixed markets down and respectively additionally asset management aum levels were impacted by the weakening of the pound and the euro with of asset management aum outside the us at the end of the year despite the lower auma levels operating net revenues declined only to billion as a result of higher interest earnings and pretax earnings reached a new high of million reflecting the diversified revenue dynamics i discussed coupled with the excellent expense discipline lets turn to advice wealth management on slide wealth management continues to deliver strong organic growth and business momentum a reflection of our differentiated value proposition with the challenging market backdrop clients assets declined to billion in however we have sustained growth of over ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 the past two years total client net flows remained very strong at over billion in the quarter and reached a record billion for the full year while we continue to see a solid level of flows into wrap accounts there has been a distinct pickup in flows going to brokerage accounts and certificates as clients navigate the market backdrop revenue per advisor reached up over the past two years from continued enhanced productivity and business growth on slide you can see wealth management profitability was exceptional up and reached a record margin of as strong organic growth and higher interest earnings exceeded pressure from market depreciation and lower transactional activity adjusted operating expenses declined with distribution expenses down reflecting lower transactional activity and lower client assets ga increased in the quarter and for the full year ga grew expense growth in the quarter was driven by continued investments in the bank and higher volumerelated activity from strong organic growth additionally the prior year included unusually low expenses relating to staff levels and ph te cash balances in the quarter increased yearoveryear and sequentially to billion which included billion of certificate balances cash rebalances have declined slightly bringing it closer to historic levels however certificates have grown yearoveryear as clients are laddering liquidity to garner higher yields as a complement to our certificate offering we are continuing to build out our savings and deposit products in the bank this year to meet the growing client appetite for yield as a reminder the majority of our clients sweep cash balances are working cash accounts with the average account size being only and constituting over of our total cash balances and our operating rates continue to remain competitive with continuous benchmarking against the industry this has translated into higher interest earnings in the quarter the gross fee yield in the quarter reached basis points up basis points from the prior year and over basis points sequentially with bank and certificates driving most of it the bank ended the year with assets of billion with additional capacity to grow further this provides flexibility to capture the benefits of rising interest rates by investing in highquality longer duration securities these investments will create sustainable multiple year benefits regardless of interest rate changes over that period new money purchases in the quarter were approximately basis points above the spreads from ph wealth balance sheet cash this has been supplemented with strong growth within our certificate company with assets growing to nearly billion in the quarter and a gross fee yield of nearly basis points as we move into we are on a trajectory to generate growth in interest earnings from the bank and ph growing our incremental yield while continuing to maintain high credit quality in the first half of the year we are moving billion onto the banks balance sheet we expect to transfer additional balances in the back half of and as we previously indicated we will reinvest approximately billion of maturities into higheryielding assets throughout the course of the year lets turn to asset management on slide in the backdrop remained challenging for both us and the industry aum was billion down this decrease was driven by doubledigit equity and fixed income market depreciation as well as negative pound and euro foreign exchange impacts flows during the period remained challenged as global institutional net inflows during were more than offset by ongoing retail pressure as a reminder net flows benefited from the billion bmo us asset transfer which had limited impact in ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 on slide you can see asset management financials reflect the continuation of the challenging market environment and reflect deleveraging that occurs in this business earnings were million a decline as a result of market depreciation and net outflows in addition the prior year period included million in performance fees while the current quarter only included million as well as million of unfavorable markto market adjustments as a result margin in the quarter declined to importantly we are focused on the areas we can control and on executing our strategic priorities expenses remain well managed total expenses were down with ga and other expenses down from continued expense disciplines lower performance fee compensation and timing of marktomarket expenses as a reminder results last year include a partial quarter of bmo related expenses as we move forward we will continue to make market driven tradeoffs and discretionary spending and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly based on the revenue environment lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions earnings increased with strong cash flow generation and a clearly differentiated risk profile results in the quarter were driven by enhanced yield from repositioning of the investment portfolio lower deferred acquisition cost amortization and lower sales levels we remain well capitalized with an estimated rbc ratio of at yearend consistent with the industry sales in the quarter declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as the impact from our actions to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits now only billion of account value is in products with living benefit guarantees a billion decline from past year protection sales remain concentrated in highermargin asset accumulation vul which represents onethird of total insurance in force assets the increase in investment income was a direct result of the actions taken to reposition the investment portfolio in the quarter we repositioned million primarily into longer duration corporate bonds while maintaining a high quality portfolio these actions will generate higher investment income in on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified aa rated investment portfolio is wellpositioned during the quarter new money purchases were aa rated at yields that were accretive to the overall portfolio despite continued market volatility in the quarter va hedging effectiveness remained very strong at and excess capital and holding company liquidity remains strong our diversified business model generates significant and stable free cash flow this enables the company to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders while continuing to invest for growth during the quarter we repurchased million shares returning a total of million of capital to shareholders bringing the total for the year to billion our capital return strategy over the past five years has reduced our share count by with that well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and your first question is from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions you flagged the certificate growth in the wealth business and thats certainly consistent with what weve seen at other wealth management firms so would you expect that as long as rates stay high that type of shift and that type of growth should be sustainable and how should we think about the corresponding impact of the mix shift on your deposit beta ph saw that the deposit beta seemed to take a step up this quarter and so should we continue to think that that will move higher walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes this is walter so the answer is that you should with ph our cds continue to see that sort of trend line and youll see that in our bank we are going to develop new products ph with them and have them coming out ph in which will also enhance capabilities for our advisors and their clients to certainly navigate this situation on interest rates and giving them choice and from the deposit beta standpoint looking on sweep we are certainly we are up we are certainly being competitive from that standpoint but we are offering a wide choice and we see good significant opportunities as we move forward brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah that makes sense and like i said thats consistent with many of your competitors in the wealth space so when we think about shifting gears a little bit for the followup and staying in wealth strong overall net new asset trends certainly have been encouraging annualized growth in that business in what has been a challenging quarter for some competitors as i understand it its not really recruiting driving the numbers but rather advisors growing their practices and expanding wallet share of existing clients so what have you done to sustain and hopefully encourage that trend into the future james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so this is jim we are very much focused on continuing really around having the advisors engage with the client through this market cycle and really providing the advice they need part of the journey really is how do you think about achieving your goals over time not just based on a quarter or the market situation in the current time and so that engagement and the tools and capabilities that we provided to help them do that i think is paying really good dividends and so as you saw last year we had a record amount of client inflows for the full year and the fourth quarter was really strong at billion its actually the second highest quarter we had the highest was actually fourth quarter of last year that was only million more so we want to continue that journey around that advice value proposition and the engagement and helping the advisors really do that more consistently over time ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you for taking my questions operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning jim and walter this is michael anagnostakis on for steven i just wanted to start with one around awm here certainly the margin expansion in awm was very impressive you hit roughly assuming the fed pauses here what do you view as a peak pretax margin in wealth inclusive of the ongoing sweeps you plan to make at the bank thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure so its walter what we achieved in the fourth quarter we certainly see as sustainable as it relates to and certainly the cash side of it is contributing to that but were also having strong productivity and growth in our basically core activities there is a shift with us going to basically the bank ph earnings and certificates generating so if the fed does pause we think we are well positioned with the sustainability of that profitability that is now basically has a duration play that will take it over multiple years so we feel comfortable obviously it will have some impact we have to evaluate as it looks not just what the fed is doing in the short end but what happens on the long end but we feel were in excellent position as we grow those two activities to ensure the sustainability and profitability michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks so and for my followup i want to shift gears maybe to retirement protection here you had noted that results in retirement protection only captured a portion of the actions you had taken in the portfolio how much incremental benefit should we expect next quarter and what do you believe could be the new run rate for that business versus that million quarterly cadence you had provided in prior quarters thanks guys walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so we certainly started the investments and we were completed in the fourth quarter we still have a little ways to go in first quarter but yes we will see that probably what youre estimating the run rate that we talked about the million but its probably with that improvement thats taking place with the yield theres always areas going in and out but im comfortable with ive seen people being in the million range but its over a oneyear cycle so i would say more like the million range for the year michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc okay guys thanks again for taking my questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 operator your next question is from the line of suneet kamath with jefferies please go ahead suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks so going back to advice wealth management again when we think about on balance sheet deposits versus certificates i think both had similar gross fee yields but how do the rates that youre paying on those compare and as we think about those two are you fairly agnostic in terms of margin benefits to you between those two products or is one more favorable than the other walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc are you saying certificates on bank or yes okay clearly the bank has a higher margin than the certificates and thats where certainly were concentrating our growth but we are getting very strong results and we have very good margins in the cd business and so the answer is we feel we have the capacity to grow those two and that is going to take a larger and larger percentage of the profitability thats being generated certainly we will be generating good earnings in the sweep activity but the real growth potential is coming in a primary bank and we will get lift in cds but the margin is better in the bank versus the cds because of different investment strategies and liquidity strategies suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah and is there a way to dimension that margin differential walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no i dont have it but im just telling you it is better at the bank and we can take a look at that and see if we can give more insight onto that suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yes makes sense and then i guess you talked about an million investment in both the bank and the certificates business over the course of the year is that something that you expect will continue into next year or any way to think about the level of capital investment that you expect for walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so the short answer is yes we will be continuing it its obviously a matter of equity and cash at closing and we have the capacity to do that and its really from our standpoint it is giving us very good returns suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it and ph maybe if i could sneak one more in on the longterm care business it looks like youre taking advantage of extending portfolio duration there as well should we read into that as the sign that maybe a risk transfer solution is less likely or is that reading into it too much ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah possibly listen for the longest time ph weve kept short term risk where the third year was and now were taking advantage both in ltc and with the protection so we are lengthening our duration but were running the business from that standpoint and you can see were garnering good profitability both on the claims side as we demonstrated in the fourth quarter and certainly now with investment capabilities that its providing us so no if something comes along its great well take a look but right now were managing it and were taking advantage of the opportunity thats there suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks walter operator your next question is from the line of erik bass with autonomous research please go ahead erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp hi thank you in investment management i think you mentioned about million of negative onetime items but even adjusting for these i think the margin was at the low end of your target range so how are you thinking about margins for and should we be expecting some improvement given the aum rebound that you saw on fourth quarter and then the emergence of bmo synergies over the course of the year walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc its an interesting situation at this stage because of the dislocations ph taking course especially as you look at the equity markets you look at fixed income depreciation and foreign exchange but theres a lot of actions that were taking and managing through but the margins from that standpoint is deleveraging just like the industry is but i would say that at this point as we look at it its heavily dependent on certainly things we dont control but for the things we do control like you mentioned bmo synergies and other things of that nature we are on track so we feel comfortable from that standpoint so i think theres a lot of variables now but we are certainly cognizant that the margins breach through but thats related to a lot of market activity that we are now managing james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc we see i mean listen again we dont know if it will hold enough but youve seen some pickup on the international market front as far as appreciation ph incurred as well as the improvement in the pound et cetera so we think a little of the headwinds have relieved a bit that will be helpful and were not changing our range as we move forward erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you and then maybe moving to capital management i think for the full year you returned about of earnings to shareholders in the fourth quarter the percentage was a little bit lower so should we still think about being the right target or has this come down at all given the capital being allocated to the bank andor the uncertain macro outlook ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay ph you go ahead james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so as we look at it weve been one of the highest returning companies out there in capital and even last year was very strong so as we look forward we have flexibility but as walter said were continuing to grow the bank which is going to require some additional capital but the returns are strong as well as our certificate company which are all good uses of capital in the past years we have freed up capital we used some of that to purchase the bmo as well as now growing the bank tremendously so we think that were going to generate continuing good free cash flow that we will return to shareholders but as far as the percentage and rate will depend on how we utilize that both for our core investments in the business as we said as well as return to shareholders so it is coming down from where it was because of those other growth opportunities but well still be a strong returner so id leave it at that at this point in time erik bass q analyst autonomous research us lp got it makes sense thank you operator your next question is from the line of tom gallagher with evercore isi please go ahead thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc good morning walter just coming with a followup on retirement protection the million or so run rate for does that contemplate any ldti accounting impacts if it doesnt can you give us some indication up or down whether that will have a negative or a positive impact and if million is the right number why was there million of overearning this quarter was it all back or maybe if you could quantify that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no i said this too that does not contemplate ldti were still evaluating that from that standpoint so it does not and well obviously settle on the approach that were going to take before the quarter as it relates to why its lower again part of that profitability improvement was lower sales and so were looking at activities as it relates to that and so that gives a positive pti in that situation plus there was some anomalies as you basically look at with the changes and the huge change in equity markets and other things that took place it gave a lift on ph slp so from that standpoint im just saying were comfortable with what you guys are indicating in the million range for the year and well continue that and were getting that lift theres no question about it for the investments that we repositioned thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc and walter does the million contemplate a little bit of extra spread that you would expect to still get or is that more of a static look at it ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no its the continuation of the volume of it but actually at this stage since that point certainly since were still investing the spread has come down from that but we still feel very confident in the ability to generate what i just said on the million for the year thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay and then my followup is how should we think about the fees and margins of the wrap versus the brokerage flows in awm i think your wrap has a little over basis points of fees the nonwrap is more commission based but just curious how do you compare the economics of the two particularly now if were going to see stronger flows into brokerage i just want to understand how thats going to impact your overall margins james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so tom as we look at the business okay weve had a bit slower flows into wrap but still good flows but you also had the depreciation of the markets which impact the wrap overall fees for the firm and so i dont feel thats permanent as i said we also had some transaction volume being down on the commission side so i would probably say if markets settle as they are youll continue to see part of that going back into the wrap programs depending on what happens with market you may see some appreciation of that which really was negative in the last few quarters and regarding the brokerage activities we will hopefully see some pickup in the commission side based on getting back into some of the contracts that people have again been more conservative investing in right now so i cant really like piece together exactly what that shift is but i would probably say theres a bunch of dynamics occurring over the last few quarters in that regard thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks operator your next question is from the line of craig siegenthaler with bank of america please go ahead q hi this is indiscernible filling in for craig i had a question within awm i was curious if you were seeing any incremental demand from thirdparty bank sweeps for deposits and what that environment looked like and then kind of following up on that too i believe your contracts were historically priced on kind of floating with a spread is there any possibility of extending the duration on those contracts which would let you capture higher yield and also offer some more visibility into cash flow while also taking pressure off of your bank walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 okay so let me answer that the answer is back about a couple of months ago there was certainly you couldnt give deposits away ph but clearly at this basis there is more demand but we are evaluating what is really from our standpoint what is the appropriate ph amount for balance sheet cash and bringing it back on balance sheet so we have a very good relationship weve been doing this for multiple years through indiscernible and so our relationship with the banks we do have a combination and laddering of long and short so we are assessing it but its a good situation from our standpoint both from the demand coming on sweep and our capacity to bring more back on to balance sheet and the fact we are still attracting good balances in q great thank you and just very quick followup and kind of switching gears a little bit i really like your certificate program thats a great cash management solution for clients with competitive rates i was curious looking at the historical allocations from past cycles is there anything different this cycle that you would say that would affect allocation that we should be taking into consideration walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc into the cd ph market yes q yes walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc listen we are very cognizant in trying to give our clients the capabilities there so that trend has been going and been evaluating as the fed makes ph the shifts and other things and alternatives so youre seeing that and yes we will continue to do that but the important thing is we are also building that capability very shortly into the bank which also gives a different set of alternatives for them to really look at their laddering as i mentioned so ph youre just adjusting and certainly having the product capability and the capabilities to grow either ph our balance sheet on balance sheet in the bank and in certs q great thank you so much walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator your next question is from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 q hey all this is ph luke on behalf of alex thanks for taking the question so keeping on topic of the bank you had a few billion of securities maturing in what kind of incremental reinvestment spread are you looking at picking up here relative to whats rolling off walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so yes we have about billion maturing during the year so right now we are thinking in the range that will be to basis points so well pick up from it i dont have the exact but ill have indiscernible but we will pick up reasonably good spread from whats maturing versus what we can invest at q got you helpful thats awesome thank you and then switching gears to firmwide do you have any thoughts on how youre thinking about firmwide ga growth in off of the billion billion base if this is the right base to think about walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes listen i think weve always demonstrated we are very disciplined in managing our expenses to ensure that we are investing for growth at the same time analyzing the margin capabilities as it relates to it so we will remain disciplined as we go and we look at shifting and where that is from that standard and getting the efficiencies that we are constantly evaluating so i would say the ranges youve seen is the ranges that we believe will certainly be sustainable but its situationally driven as we manage our expenses very tightly q great thank you operator your next question is from the line of jeff schmitt with william blair please go ahead jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc hi good morning in wealth management just thinking about cash sorting and i guess you may be capturing some of that if thats being shifted into the certificates business but do you have a sense on how much has sort of shifted maybe into sort of thirdparty mutual funds or some other investments james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so over the course of the year as you would imagine and indiscernible started last year you would have a higher level of cash from clients as they move things to the sideline or et cetera and put it fully back in the market or even in fixed income so went into money markets went into brokered cds went into other short duration products just like we have the cash here going into some of our certificates ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 the amount of cash were holding pretty much on transactional is pretty at the consistent levels its not where that has built up tremendously we just had more client flows coming in and thats just as a percentage and then we got a piece of that into our own certificate program as an example and now when we actually launch some of the preferred savings and deferred deposit programs within the bank well start to capture even a bit more hopefully of that but new cash has come in and that has raised our levels overall but theres been sorting all through this going into those other instruments as well as our advisors look at what that balances whats positional versus transactional so thats why we feel like those levels are pretty consistent because things have already sorted through the year jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay is that lower than some peers maybe just because of the client mix i mean is there greater concentration maybe of lower ph account value that would james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well in ph on case as i said i think if you look at certificates which is actually investing out a bit and you just look at the amount in our cash sweep products et cetera youre actually less than and so thats consistent with our history based on the level that clients keep for both emergency and transactional activity so thats why i said i think money has already been in all these different positional areas to garner a level of interest that the clients want with the advisors so i actually feel comfortable now some of that i think will go back when they feel comfortable putting more back into wrap and investment programs as well or longer duration products in the fixed income market jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc right okay and then just one on the bank portfolio i think thats mainly invested in mbs securities but what percentage of that book is in fixed rate investments walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the majority ph is in fixed and like i said its in structured the majority is construction high aa rated and certainly at the highest levels of the security ladder jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of john barnidge with piper sandler please go ahead john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 good morning thank you very much for the opportunity my question was on longterm care i know thirdparty claims administration accelerated the pace of terminations is that anticipated to persist and how should we think of run rate within that now walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure so yes in the quarter we had a combination of basically as you indicated a strong continued claims performance along with basically the effects of our benefit programs and basically our premium increases but there was this onetime catchup because a vendor did get behind but that was about half of it but we are seeing good trends as relates to the claims and its typical to forecast but we think we have all the foundational elements in there its been within our expectations for multiple years and so we are feeling comfortable where it is and we do again get the continued benefits of the programs that we have in place to basically contain and manage that effectively james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and weve been able to now start investing out walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thats right james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc which is garnering a higher spread for the portfolio which is good john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thats very helpful thank you and then my followup question theres been lots of ga restraint across the franchise this year but is there an optionality for asset management expense reductions given the lower aum there were some other reductions that asset managers announced this morning james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so as you saw in our asset management business we have brought expenses down and we will continue to really manage expenses tightly there now we are making good investments in certain areas we see opportunity like in some of our real estate and other areas and responsible investing but we have tightened the range a bit based on appreciation of the markets and we feel that that is necessary and appropriate now on the other side like the advice wealth as we build up more capabilities in the bank were making some investments but overall for the company weve managed expenses quite tightly not just the current year but over the years and this is actually favorable now were going to have merit increases other things et cetera but were going to look at areas of opportunity to tighten if necessary based on the market conditions but asset management is one of those areas that we will be a bit more disciplined then ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator your next question is from the line of andrew kligerman with credit suisse please go ahead andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning jim and walter question about the advisors you added this quarter good but a little light of where you were im kind of curious as to your pipeline and how you see that playing out in terms of adding new experienced advisors james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so we did add its a little less than the previous quarter et cetera but theres always timing with yearend and activities that occur as you would imagine with market conditions andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc ph sure james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc volatility there with advisors but i would say the advisors we added actually had very strong productivity so actually from a production perspective the amount in total was higher ph in what we brought in and the pipeline looks very good so i think as you see some of the advisors being added theyre really coming over because we do have a really great integrated technology platform we give a lot of great support theyre even coming because they trust the firm and the quality of the firm and they really think that thats really a benefit for them for their practices so we feel very good about the opportunity to continue here andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and then just thinking about the insurance subs rps in terms of dividending capital to the parent company the equity markets are sort of a headwind but then youre doing this tremendous repositioning on the investment portfolio could you talk a little bit about expectations for dividending capital ph as the parents fee in walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure so its walter we have and certainly as we look at it and i mentioned as related to the earnings that certainly ph related to we will manage and keep obviously our ratio and so we feel very good about the dividend capability coming out of rps but the thing with the change and certainly enough growth going on in awm the bank the stability of that we also have opportunity and that increase in the flows of ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 dividends to this parent from awm and still get dividends coming up because even though theyre under pressure for asset management they still are dividending a reasonable amount so our cash flow coming out of the various segments including rps is really we are feeling very good about its capabilities in as a source of funding for us at the parent andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc awesome can i sneak one last one just on ma last quarter you seem to think that you were going to kind of maintain the status quo in terms of divesting of blocks any change in that james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no so as we looked at the environment et cetera in the market let me put it this way i mean you probably saw a thing that was reported out even this week riversource has its like the second highest and its only up by a few basis points second highest return out there of any large insurer andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc wow james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and so i think you got to look at it in a sense as walter just said the free cash flow how we derisk the business how even what we have on the balance sheet with guarantees is coming down the products were selling are lower risk appropriate for the client we have a lot of other alternatives on the shelf for the client so we feel like this is a good hand that we have and now that the spreads have gone back up were able to invest out a bit more and garner some so listen there may be some opportunities that come along and well look at them as they do but this is a comfortable hand to have as a complement particularly with depreciating markets andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc awesome thanks operator todays final question will come from the line of ryan krueger with kbw please go ahead ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks good morning im thinking weve often seen some level of seasonality with cash balances within awm to come down some sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is that something you would expect to occur in this year walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 absolutely yeah i think we do expect and we will probably experience the same seasonality and thats been part of our overall planning so we dont see any change ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it and then just i know there was a question on overall ga expenses perhaps awm is a little bit you have maybe more insight into the outlook there given the backdrop from an earnings standpoint can you give any sense of your expectation for growth in awm ga expenses in walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i think again well go back to is geared towards making sure we get the payback on that with discipline and as we focus and so well manage it relative to the revenue and the growth opportunities we see but we will be very disciplined in it and i think it will be in ranges that youve seen in the past but again its situational ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah i mean awm this year remember we had a bounce back in meetings and other travel and te again coming back from a pandemic sort of thing where we cut all those things out as well as we may continue to make good investments in the growth of the bank and bringing in advisors et cetera so youre going to have merit and other things that are there but i think on a balance basis our expenses will be managed pretty well and we dont see that accelerating in any way but as walter said whatever were making investments well get good returns on but i dont think that will be at a high level operator we have no further questions at this time this concludes todays conference thank you all for participating you may now disconnect ameriprise financial inc
