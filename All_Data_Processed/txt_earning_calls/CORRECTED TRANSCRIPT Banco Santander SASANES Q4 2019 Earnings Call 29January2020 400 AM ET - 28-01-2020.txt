management discussion section sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa good morning everyone thanks for joining to this grupo santander earnings presentation heading by our group executive chairman ana botín and josé antonio álvarez the group chief executive officer our chairman will address in detail the performance of in terms of pl balance sheet and obviously our group ceo will cover much more detail in the photo map on a countrybycountry basis the chairman then would follow up with our business model that delivers the prospects in terms of profitability growth and will jump into qa so with no further delays please ana ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea executive chairman banco santander sa so thank you good morning so thank you very much sergio and good morning to everybody i will begin by summing up the year was a very good year for us we have delivered on both growth profitability and trend targets we grew loyal and digital customers again by and respectively yearonyear and this has resulted in quality growth in our revenues of thats again yearonyear profitability our underlying return on riskweighted assets has improved by basis points we have maintained an underlying return on tangible equity of while increasing by the way our tangible equity by billion and that puts us well on track to achieve ourmedium term goals of to we continue to be one of the most efficient and profitable banks among our peers and a costtoincome of remains bestinclass and the combination has allowed us to further strengthen our balance sheet raising our fully loaded cet1 to and that is despite regulatory headwinds this year of basis points so based on these excellent results we have announced today that the board will propose to the agm in april a total dividend per share in results of importantly though will be paid in cash and this represents a close to increase in our cash eps this year again we continue growing as we have over the past few years our cash dividend and basically we have more than doubled the total cash dividend per share over the last five years so going now to the next slide here you can see pl for the year its been a challenging environment especially in europe we have delivered very solid and consistent revenue and profit growth with total revenues increasing yearonyear on a constant currency basis and reaching a record billion with underlying attributable profit for the year also up on a constant currency basis up to billion and very importantly accelerating again in q4 its been an excellent quarter better than the full year growing underlying profits at going onto the next slide i would like to cover the three strategic priorities we set for ourselves back in april and briefly summarized you can see here how we have made progress this year on all three of them improving the operating performance across all regions continuing to allocate our capital to those regions and businesses with great discipline by the way that generate highest returns and of course accelerating the digital transformation through santander global platform banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 and underlying all of this and very important for us and for all the team is continuing to focus on building a responsible bank doing a lot of progress on culture across the group changing the way were working with very different initiatives from flexi working to diversity to the rollout in many more countries of agile teams working together across the group in all our core banks so allow me to cover briefly the progress on each one of these pillars during the year if you go to the next slide we further leverage the diversification and scale of the group and we have been improving our operational performance across the regions but also in our global businesses we have simplified into a three region management structure which is delivering excellent results we announced this in april there is a much more effective collaboration across the regions in parallel but also converging against a common group ultimately building one single platform europe is successfully driving a simplification effort and delivering results on efficiency we generated about million in net cost savings that is about of the billion net cost savings target and across europe europe as a region has delivered return on tangible equity north america again growing doubledigit in all the key metrics benefiting from high operational leverage from the group with underlying profit in the us growing by yearonyear again after a very good year in and improving the return on tangible equity by sic basis points this is adjusted for excess capital mexico again excellent performance weve done major investment in mexico increasing customers and maintaining a yearonyear increase in profits and return on tangible equity of close to and last but not the least south america which remains the group growth engine led by brazil delivering best results ever with an increase yearonyear in underlying and at the same time getting ready for the future increasing efficiency and return on tangible equity up by basis points to if we now cover briefly the global businesses this is a very very important priority for all of us josé antonio myself and all the teams to rally build global businesses so we can more and more leverage the groups scale and strength and you can see that today these two global businesses are contributing of the groups profit increasingly driving network effects and enhancing the competitiveness of our core banks corporate investment banking continues to grow strongly underlying profit was higher and driven by a strong growth in revenues with a return on riskweighted assets of continues to improve over the years one of the best among peers our wealth management division and insurance which was created recently continues to improve total assets under management grown by in to very close to billion and underlying profit growing by to billion last but not least and i will give you a bit more detail on this later santander global platform continues to progress again working across the group on a horizontal basis and really helping us all the countries and businesses create efficiencies but also grow revenues and customer experience our digitalization strategy is paying off and you can see this in the positive evolution of digital metrics we focused on improving customer experience as the big driver to improve growth in customers and this especially true in mobile we now have million digital customers as a reminder we started five years ago with million subscribers but just yearonyear thats a increase and that now represents more than half our active customers banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 our digital customers are more and more engaged just to give you an idea digital customers engage online with us five times per week this results in million digital touch points per month but very importantly this is also translating into sales and sales on the mobile channel have grown by two times in as a result of all of this of new products across the group sold in was through digital channels and reaching by the way in december thats a percentage point yearonyear growth its important because customers are increasingly using digital so we are using and refocusing the branches more and more on the higher valueadded and more complex products which of course is adding to strengthen relationships but also profitability and you can see some of these numbers in the next slide the fact that digital sales are growing so strongly is driving profitability so our investments in digital are evident in these numbers we can now deliver products more efficiently as you can see the marginal cost of transaction is going down dramatically but again as an example in brazil we have it here on the slide the cost for the bank of doing a transfer through digital channels is less than if the customer does this in the branch but the uk which is another great example the cost of selling a mortgage online is less if done indeed on a digital basis so the improved operating performance and optimization of our capital allocation is enabling us to enhance our profitability and we are very very focused on improving the return on riskweighted assets performance by regions you can see here weve been very consistent in terms of allocating more capital to the higher growth and highopportunity markets as a summary in of the groups riskweighted assets generated already returns above the reference return on riskweighted assets rorwa of which is well above our cost of equity this is points increase over last year and really what it means is that we are bringing and weve been doing this every year but in an additional billion of riskweighted and billion in nominal term loans were now above the cost of equity compared to last year and improving the underlying rorwa as we said by basis points all of this is supported of course by improvements across the americas and across the group just as a reminder also where we are coming from if we look back five years the rorwa was if we calculate the capital we have back in and the rorwa we have today of we would actually be at a return on tangible equity of this is just a way to look at how we have improved the businesses over these five years of course we continue as i said with this accretive capital rebalancing and there is more capital allocated in this case to south america and north america in a very consistent way in europe the rorwa allocated to europe is minus in north america its plus and south america plus and this is again a measure of how we are maximizing profitability and at the same time balancing this with keeping the franchise and investing for the future another example of this rebalancing of course is the buyback of the minorities in mexico which we did in in terms of what happened in in gross capital generation as this business model and execution of our strategy is progressing we have generated a record basis points gross capital in that is more than double the guidance this was of course partially offset by the basis points of regulatory impact which resulted in a net plus basis points increase to a cet1 of its important we have done this while increasing cash dividends per share and investing in the business in total as you can see in this slide during we generated the equivalent of billion of capital preminorities we are at these levels very comfortable with our current not just capital levels but also buffers over regulatory requirements and again this is due to the resilience and diversification of our business banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 considering our cet1 and also the historical consistency fiveyear track record where weve been generating basis points per year we expect to be close to by yearend this would place us ahead of time at the top end of our to midterm goal in we expect some quarterly volatility we have agreed to certain acquisitions during this year that will close this is factor into the numbers and the expectation one of the examples is allianz insurance business which we bought back recently or the acquisition of ebury and of course reaching the top end of this capital goal by the end of means we will not need to continue to accumulate capital and will provide additional strategic flexibility in terms of capital in summary i would say has been an excellent year weve made very significant progress in executing our strategy weve generated what i consider and what we consider outstanding results and weve done this while investing for the future and transforming the bank we have also created shareholder value we have increased our tangible book value per share of plus cumulative cash dividend by and importantly we have done this while conducting our business in a responsible and sustainable way that has been really important for all of us and its increasingly important to all people and teams across the santander group i am very proud we are very proud that santander has been recognized as the most sustainable bank in the world by the dow jones sustainability index we have also been named leader again for the second year in the bloomberg genderequality index we are more and more diverse at the board and at leadership level and we have been improving and have very high levels of employee engagement of our teams are proud to work at santander and this is recognized also as across the countries where we have been recognized one of the top best companies to work for in five of our markets and as a group one of the top best companies in the world to work for again we are working hard on all these levels supporting financial inclusion but also supporting our customers in the transition to a lowcarbon economy and as i said helping inclusion and the underserved customers in all our markets so i now leave you with josé antonio who will cover in a bit more detail our operating performance josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thanks ana and good morning to everyone pl reflects i will say solid growth in customer revenue good cost management that reflects the synergies obtained in some countries and provisions growing basically in line with volumes i also want to say that we see great sustainability quarteronquarter after quarter in q4 we generated underlying profit of around billion that is higher than the fourth quarter in last year and excluding the deposit warranty fund contribution in spain more than the third quarter in in addition we have had this quarter the positive impact of million the net capital gains and provisions which boosted attributable profit in the quarter to around billion further you have the detail of nonrecurring items in the appendix in page broken down by quarters i will summarize now the main items in q4 that were the capital gains from custody for custody million dta recoveries due to changes in tax regulation in brazil million net capital losses related with disposal of real estate business in spain million restructuring costs in several countries million those are the main set items banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 so as a result net capital gains and provisions in amounted to billion of which approximately billion do not impact capital going to the revenues we reached record high revenues of more than billion while revenue will be characterized with very high quality of the revenue comes from the more recurrent and stable lines nii and fee income and the total revenue grew boosted by the americas and our global business while europe remained flat net interest income grew very much in line with the business volumes combined with active management of the spreads we continue to see expect further improvement in the cost of deposits net fee income grew well at least its worth stressing as ana said that our global business are growing significantly faster than that and the global business already represent of the total fees generated by the group we are confident that we can continue to deliver highquality revenue going forward on the cost side this reflects very well with the our execution in europe costs dropped in nominal terms in real terms reflecting the synergies integration and optimization and simplification process that ana referred to previously the decrease in spain was million of the cost base we expect additional strong fall next year portugal is also reducing cost and uk is probably we are starting their results in the transformation program with the second half of the the cost coming down and a process that will accelerate in in north america both countries are increasing cooperation in order to improve commercial capabilities and eliminate duplicate costs lastly cost control in south america combined with business growth and strong improvement in efficiency so in short cost management enabled us to remain leaders in efficiency with cost to income of credit quality well indiscernible the npl ratio continues to fall the cost of credit is flat coverage is at healthy levels let me do make a short summary of the group performance in the year increase in our underlying profit strength in the capital ratio improving credit quality while maintaining bestinclass efficiency high profitability both in terms of return on tangible equity and rorwa and improved tangible net asset value per share plus dividends going to the business areas you can see the remaining very well diversified of the underlying profit comes from the americas and from europe while the profit is growing in out of the our core markets particularly growing at double digit in brazil us mexico and poland our global business has also increased at doubledigit rates enable us to strengthen our local franchise through the global business when it comes to volumes loan growth was deposit growth pretty much the same mutual funds grew and the loan growth you see different patterns in line with our previous guidance still the leverage in spain and brazil being more spain sorry the leverage in spain and portugal being more selective in our lending in those countries due to the profitability issues and growing in all the other markets particularly in south america and also i want to remark the us that is growing pretty well going by countries in spain has been the year in which we complete the popular integration this was the main task for the year having said that we are seeing positive dynamics in individuals growth in consumer activity and in valuegenerating business such as insurance and mutual funds nevertheless the stock of credit fell yearonyear due to wholesale banking deleveraging and a slowdown in mortgages mainly some of these deleverage is because we are as ana already mentioned being more active in our capital allocation banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 in results profit fell in the quarter it was through the deposit guarantee scheme grow grew underlying profit in the year was higher mainly driven by a strong reduction in costs total income was we improved the retail customer nii primarily boosted by the fall of in cost of funding the indiscernible was offset by the lower contribution from the alco portfolio the negative impact of ifrs and lower wholesale balances npl ratio keep improving in we expect the cost to continue to fall sharply and credit quality indicators should improve in revenue we expect a stable nim with better funding cost and lower revenue from financial transactions due to the smaller alco portfolio we expect profitability to remain well above of our cost of equity in consumer finance another good year our market share against the market the auto market is now growing in europe we are growing so market share gains and while we continue to reach agreements with oems that provide a good starting point for the future to keep growing as weve been doing in the last couple of years in we see volume growth some pressure on margins the cost growing below business growth and the cost of credit remaining at good levels going forward in the uk we face a operating environment characterized by high levels of competition and uncertainty good year in volumes revenue was affected by pressure on mortgage margins particularly svr attrition and overdraft regulation costs went down in real terms better trend in the second half as i said before and we maintained very low cost of credit in the quarter better top line trends in particularly nii and cost net operating income after provisions increased by we expect continued revenue pressure which could be offset with the cost reduction so we are on we expect to be on track to achieve our mediumterm profitability targets announced in investor day when it comes to mexico excellent performance both in the year in terms of cost as volume for growth our transactionality is growing at more than this is a remarkable number while we continued to improve our profitability with return on tangible equity close to while the year was good profit growth yearonyear in we expect solid business dynamics to continue which should drive future further profit growth in the states i will say another good year in the states underlying profit grew volumes grew significantly credit customer funds revenue increased due to greater volumes offset lower interest rates loan loss provisions increased only by in q4 as you well know we have the usual seasonal impact particularly in scusa but by the way is doing very well originations grew significantly during the year and credit quality remains healthy in we are confident that this performance will continue thanks to our commercial and operative capabilities and the greater cooperation with mexico finally were going to elaborate in brazil positive momentum we keep gaining market share in key markets our in retail our growth was consumer finance yearonyear and demand deposits profitability improved again our return on tangible equity is above and underlying profit grew net interest income was driven by volumes some margin pressure net fee income grew very well based on insurance market share gains payments gains and securities market share gains efficiency and cost of credit has historic lows from around five years ago to costincome and cost of credit from to below that we think is sustainable in we expect to maintain high profitability boosted by market share gains and profit growth backed by greater volumes that will offset margin pressures no material change in the cost of credit we expect in banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 well to finish other countries im not going to elaborate in other countries you have all the information in the appendix you have the information positive performance in portugal poland argentina chile and the others growing well and with all of them doubledigit except chile at slightly impacted by the fourth quarter in the country in relation with the corporate center two only to mention two points we have the income was impacted by greater falling currency hedging in the region of million the counterpart of this is in the conversion of results to euros in certain countries lower nii due to the higher stock of issuance in and ifrs impact cost decreased by you have further detail in the regions and global business i already commented you can find all these informations in the appendix ill now hand back to ana to finish this presentation ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea executive chairman banco santander sa thank you very much josé antonio so i would like now just to briefly look at the future and really remind us of our strategy our strategy has not changed we have a clear vision we have a clear purpose we are aiming to help people and businesses prosper and do this in a way that is simple and personal and fair our aim is to be the best open financial services platform by acting responsibly and also earning the lasting loyalty of our stakeholders i am very proud of the progress we have made since we launched in and i must say i am every time every year more excited about the future so we will continue to leverage our unique business model to drive performance and also to make a better place for the future we have maintained and built this year again based on our global scale with leading market positions inmarket positions in lending in of our core markets we are relentlessly focusing on customers we have improved our loyal customer base by since and we are very proud that we rank amongst the top banks in customer satisfaction as measured by nps in six countries finally we have a diversified geographical footprint operating in both emerging and mature markets and it is precisely this acceleration in execution which we aimed for at the beginning of we have done this coupled with our loyalty strategy and our focus on profitability which has allowed us once more to be more resilient more predictable than peers and also to generate growth since weve built a very strong foundation for the future we have significantly reinforced our capital with the cet1 increasing by billion over the period that is basis points in five years at the same time weve improved our return on tangible equity by basis points our return on riskweighted assets is basis points higher and earnings per share has grown over the period by importantly this performance has been also targeted sorry also supported by additional investments and that includes around billion per annum in digital and technology restructuring our legacy but also investing for the future and increasing efficiency we also spent over billion over the period to restructure our banks we have grown our capital and invested in our business we have also delivered value for our shareholders we have returned to shareholders over this time billion in dividends i want to stress this because this is a very strong signal that the board and management has huge confidence in the future and weve grown our tangible net asset value per share by just note that this includes minorities banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 so again we are confident that our strategy will allow us to achieve our midterm targets we made this public in april last year we are today also adding another guidance to the market which is high singledigit underlying eps cagr over the next three years and this compares very favorably with our peer group and european banks and we believe that this is something we can deliver going back to what i already mentioned and we set out in april of last year so i would like briefly to cover the future in terms of the three pillars that were working across the group which again continuing to improve the operating performance across the regions continuing and with taking additional organizational incentives in that were implementing again in to make sure that everybody is aligned towards the goal of maximizing profitability and return on riskweighted assets but very importantly also working to accelerate santander global platform i want to also stress that building a more responsible bank is a huge priority for all of us and this is not just slides this is more and more embedded across the organization at all levels were implementing new measures we recently announced in november or december that we aim to have our own activity as a bank carbon footprint by net zero by reducing emissions and compensating where we are not able to reduce down to zero and this then is at the core its not just about the carbon footprint its much more than that of course its diversity and so on and this is at the core of our performance going forward you can see here the targets we maintain all the targets we set out in april so youve seen this before we reiterate our targets for both europe for north america and south america and really the goal behind this is as i said to operate as one santander we are working across the regions to accelerate this aim and its working but obviously the goal is to converge europe is going to remain challenging but i see it on the positive side if we can succeed in europe well be much more successful eventually in the rest of the world because it is the hardest environment by far we do not just want to reduce costs we want to do this in a structural way by having the vision of where banking is going for the future and then implementing towards that vision in north america were also working together leveraging the size of our mexican bank and grow and actually working together with the us with a very ambitious plan that we set out three four years ago and we again will be focusing here on profitable growth but in south america exactly the same we are not just working on revenues were also working on building common platforms and you will see more of this during so just in summary to say that im very confident we will achieve the return on tangible equity and efficiency targets that we set out in april of last year so at the core of our plans for the last five years weve accelerated the optimization of capital this year we needed to do that and you can see that when we need it were able to manage our balance sheet to deliver more growth in our capital in organic capital we continue to indiscernible to the most profitable geographies we are setting minimum profitability thresholds not just by country but by segments we have already and its taken us a couple of years but we have the tools to manage this across the group and were working on faster asset rotation this youll see this again this year we have a new organization where our cfos also have the mandate of cios chief investment officers this has been implemented or will be implemented in the next month and we expect that the combination of all these efforts will enable us to deliver this midterm underlying rorwa of to banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 so if we look at now at digitalization and building santander global platform this is probably the most strategic of our goals but its really its working on two levels were going to continue the digitalization of our banks and the group transforming our core banks to be completely digital front to back and we can see the progress in some of the numbers i gave you earlier we are leveraging more and more common capabilities we have many examples of tools that are developed centrally or in a country and then shared across the group we have a lot of agile teams working already which are improving customer experience and helping us on efficiency just let me mention one which is recently were in mexico and mexico as a country saved about of the cost to develop its sme bestinclass mobile app by using the global services which we had developed together across the group on the individual banking app again this is happening more and more sharing across countries and we are also and thats the second part of our strategy building global digital banking solutions with payments at the core and this will be not just for our own banks but for others so third parties and this is going to amplify these investments were making in the payments platform and the global digital bank just very briefly on sgp you will be hearing more and more about this over the next few years we have already created the segment but its still work in progress its not the end product its really a move to become a global leader in payments and digital banking solutions because these are key drivers this is not new its always been the case but the key drivers of customer loyalty both for smes and individuals and similar to the way our global businesses of corporate banking and wealth and insurance what sgp aims is to leverage our scale our footprint and our expertise in payments and financial services which will enable us its actually already enabling us to build our own digital assets and fintech solutions just once and then deploy across the group and this will dramatically lower development costs and time to market as i said we expect sgp to serve initially our own banks and their customers but in a second stage also third parties and were actually beginning already to test this and to build bestinclass payment and digital banking solutions as of today we are focusing on these four highgrowth large addressable markets in which we can and are already delivering results i have briefly covered that in the next slide if we think about smes were focusing on two verticals one is merchant acquiring and the other one is international trade global merchant services is based on a company we acquired in brazil getnet getnet has doubled market share in brazil a very competitive market in the last five years very high customer engagement about annual transaction growth since i want to say that santander is already a top global acquirer by turnover volume in the world and we are already launching in mexico this quarter and we have plans detailed plans to roll it out in another eight countries over the next couple of years global trade services again we have sme customers real very loyal customers across the group that trade this is a large and a growth market to accelerate our progress were basically following the footprint same footprint or path as we did with getnet ebury we worked for two three years really scouring the whole world what is that kind of team we wanted and i want to stress the ebury team is one of the main reasons that weve done this acquisition but they also have a great track record theyre growing the top line yearon year and its a bestinclass trade and foreign exchange facilitator were going to build around it a again a global platform for trade for all our countries and were expecting to be rolling out to markets very soon finally for individuals we were again working on two lines on the affluent segment even though its also very interesting for others and the underserved superdigital again a brazilian a small acquisition its a simple and banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 flexible way we call it prebanking service its really a market where just in latin america we estimate million underserved people customers we aim to provide them with basic financial products in a way that is also profitable or lets say gives sensible returns for the bank to give you also a vision of what were building around sgp superdigital is already working in brazil with getnet gms so really all of these building blocks can work with each other were actually already live with superdigital in not just brazil but mexico and chile and growing customers at about annually and transactions almost two times faster and the goal is to reach over million active customers over the next few years and finally openbank which is our global fullservice digital bank whats different from openbank to other new banks is that there are real customer relationships these are not just users openbank was either first or second highest growth bank in spain in i dont remember the year and very importantly and this is a very important measure with sic payroll accounts which means that there is more and more loyal customers and as you can see products per customer but a new product which is mortgages endtoend mortgages growing at this is a business model which should give us in a steady state around roe in europe and we are live already not just in spain but germany the netherlands and portugal and launching in other countries over the next few years so as a summary again was a very good year all the regions delivered solid operating performance we grew the top line record revenue and we improved profitability our capital position is strong its been a record year in terms of organic capital generation reaching cet1 we are very comfortable with our current capital levels and buffers and are wellpositioned to take advantage of what we see as very significant opportunities for profitable growth and creating value for our shareholders based on this performance the board agreed yesterday to propose a close to increase in our cash dividend per share just to and id say that as we head into and beyond we have a clear we have a focused strategy in place which gives us a very high degree of confidence that we will deliver on our mediumterm goals including the highsingledigit earnings per share cagr over the next three years so thank you very much and we now have time for questions sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa yes thanks ana josé antonio indeed we can proceed now with the qa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question comes from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes hello so thank you very much for the presentation i wanted to start with capital so first of all if you can update on the regulatory impacts on capital ratio suspected for either negative depending impact from trim or eventually positive if you can update on where are you on the models in the uk and then also on some of the corporate transactions if you can comment on the impact from the scusa tender offer and if you think that this together with the sale of puerto rico will be enough to offset the other the acquisitions of the allianz and the ebury deal and then also beyond what other regulatory impacts shall we expect and in particular if you can update on the guidance for basel iv and where do you plan to be in terms of capital in a postbasel iv world thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so as we said i mean i want to reiterate and its very important that we are very comfortable with the level and with the buffers visàvis regulatory requirements regarding keeping our midterm goal of being between to what we are doing is we are accelerating reaching so we said medium term close to we expect given the business model transformation and profitability and the fact that we generated basis points per year to be close by by year end there will be some interquarterly volatility as you know and as you said we will have allianz and ebury and some other purchases we will have some offsetting partially offsetting sales and there will be some remaining negative headwinds with all of that in consideration we expect to be close to by the end of in terms of basel iv again what we are saying here is that we are very confident we can absorb basel iv and maintain an attractive dividend policy and finance profitable growth i want to say that we absorbed basis points of regulatory headwinds in at the same time we grew our loans by and as i mentioned we are proposing to the shareholders meeting cash dps growth of close to the number that was mentioned in the q3 call of basis points has several caveats first that it is a very preliminary number and it is premitigation so there are some mitigation measures that were not considered second is that we do expect other positive regulatory issues would be the capital treatment of intangibles for example that would help us but last but not least we still expect the impact to be less than peers i think ive answered all of the questions thank you sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks paco next operator thank you the next question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning thanks for taking my call my question two questions first of all on the target for this year when you think about obviously theres been some disappointments for the last couple of years when you think about visibility of those headwinds that youve outlined and that target are you much more confident on the visibility now of the regulatory headwinds in particular trim or eba guidelines or all the long list is the has the visibility of those impacts improved and are you in a position as a result to sort of get rid of the scrip dividend for and the second question is on your high singledigit eps growth consensus i think its more probably half of that when you think of the last year since you gave your target obviously margin pressure is worse certainly in developed markets than you probably thought so is cost the offset of that is it that once you reach your target youre going to be able to deploy more capital to grow the business just a bit of color on if its going to be frontend loaded backend loaded versus consensus expectations as a general commentary thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so please let me be clear that the target is not the target is to be between and so as we said in april our target is to be between and we are going to get close to just by the natural profitability of improvement of our model we have delivered every year what we said we would deliver and its clear that not were very predictable yearonyear but its hard to be very predictable quarteronquarter and my sense is that when one quarter were a bit below again what matters is not just the levels but the buffers against the regulatory requirements and as we said we are very comfortable and i have to say over the last five years just to give you an example the uk capital levels our bank in the uk is now going to be at thats basis points more than a year ago so there have been in some places increases and weve been able to absorb that and i think what gives us high confidence is that when we need to absorb basis points we can do that organically obviously riskweighted assets grew less in than we probably could have done by the way profitably so what youll see once we dont have this basis points like we had this year is you should expect higher profitable growth in places like brazil i mean brazil should grow faster next year and given we still have some regulatory headwinds next year weve actually taken some of that already in q4 something like basis points you should see some impact but nothing near what we saw this year so to answer your question i think we do have higher visibility the tone is actually different there are some positives ahead that will come in play even in in terms of being able to cover through pillar some of the requirements but i want to stress that our aim is to be between and get close to and then be able to have some volatility there to maximize the opportunities for our shareholders the high singledigit eps that is for the three years again it might be more one year than another so its not a mathematical lets say progression but whats important is the cagr for these three years and the model we have always means that some countries are going to do a bit better than others the opportunities because of the macro because of the market conditions are better in one market than another and that is essentially the model we have where we can rebalance and reallocate capital banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 just to give you an idea of the flexibility we have in terms of capital allocation and what weve done in very successfully is that about a third of our balance sheet gets replaced every year so we have a lot of control as to what assets we put into the books we are doing more and more originate to distribute because other entities are more efficient holders of loans but we want to maintain the relationship with our customers because thats what give us the strength to build a global platform so id say that again the earnings per share goal for the next three years is i think a very good sign that the mediumterm targets we set for ourself will be reached sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks alvaro next question please operator thank you the next question ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa sorry sorry i forgot operator comes from ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa no i forgot operator sorry yes go ahead ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa forgot the scrip yes the scrip sorry about that so the scrip is we explained this last year and my job and the job of the board josé antonio all of us is to try to make all our shareholders happy but not all shareholders are the same and about of the company is owned by retail shareholders and they love the scrip and so weve been reducing it with the proposal were taking were taking it down to of the total will be scrip and we have said that depending on how the year progresses we might actually buy back the scrip so thats something that gives us added flexibility were trying to keep everybody happy and not everybody is going to be happy as happy all the time but were really i mean the current management is very focused on earnings per share tangible nav per share and we are very conscious that this is important for many of you on the call but we also have to consider our retail shareholders so depending on the year we might im saying we might we have authorization from the shareholders we asked for that last year sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa next question banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 operator thank you the next question comes from andrea unzueta from credit suisse please go ahead andrea unzueta q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd hi thank you i wanted to get more clarity on your expectations of earnings growth for brazil and mexico in particular were seeing a lot increased competition in both regions in fees in particular in brazil and a lot of margin pressures in mexico so a bit of visibility on what your earnings growth expectations are in those regions would be helpful and also if you could remind me whether the impact of higher taxes in brazil should have an impact on our expectations for thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa sure so let me just give you the sort of my high level view and then i would let josé antonio to complement a bit more guidance but id say all in all the good news for us is that in across south america and mexico growth was more or less zero so from mexico down to all of south america zero growth this year were expecting brazil actually to be between to growth were expecting mexico to grow a bit more chile is the only one were expecting less growth so the first message the first positive is that we expect volume growth i always say this that we make a lot of our profits in south and latin america but we lend very little money we actually you can see that and thats a huge opportunity theres a lot of profitable growth ahead so especially in brazil margins will obviously be much lower with interest rates at but volumes and very good quality growth is ahead to give you an example last year we did already billion in mortgages in brazil i mean a few years ago that was like unheard of so we expect volume growth to compensate margin but very importantly and this is something in latin america we have not waited for things to happen we started in april of last year working across the region with very significant and you can see the numbers already in brazil with a lot of focus on cost a lot of focus on building common platforms so you are going to see efficiency improvements were going to invest but were going to follow in this the other way the example of europe that we need to become much more efficient so those are two things that are important taxes will go up in brazil by i think points points yeah and thats considered so when you consider all of that mexico brazil were expecting roughly the same profitability this year roughly and i think this guidance was given in october by brazil we reiterate the guidance of mexico brazil somewhere around return on tangible equity i think thats some so josé antonio says hes fine so sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa yes ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa next sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thanks andrea next question operator thank you the next question comes from benjamin toms from rbc please go ahead benjamin toms q analyst rbc capital markets morning thank you for taking my questions firstly on poland can you give us an update on polish swiss franc mortgage mitigation did you take a provision in the quarter and secondly the ecb hosted a call yesterday on srep requirements in the call they stated that the average pillar for gsibs and universal banks was i know youre not allowed to tell us your pillar but is there any reason why santander wouldnt be in line with the average gsib and universal banks could santander in fact be any better than average due to the relatively strong performances in the stress test thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so i will let josé antonio answer on poland but on ecb the srep obviously we cannot comment on p2g but its clear that santander has delivered through the cycle more predictable more sustainable growth diversification works across and years thats all i can say but obviously the gcp is different and so doesnt necessarily have to be the same srep requirement we cannot say anything right good so we cannot say more than that but we do i mean i might say we are seeing a bit of a change in the tone and there is a pillar change that will come into effect at the beginning of next year which is obviously a benefit would be a benefit for most banks including ourselves and poland josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well in relation with the swiss franc portfolio we have a portfolio in poland of around chf billion portfolio chf billion in the bank chf million in the consumer finance operation after the ecb court ruling in september the final outcome will be decided by on a casebycase basis by the courts as a matter of fact the rulings we have had in now in the courts that are a small number around cases we won around twothirds of these and onethird were in favor of the customer so we took a provision in the fourth quarter that i think cover us for the current expectations so its but i can we can say at this time were going to see on a casebycase basis what happens in the courts in the coming years but we feel comfortable with the provision we took at the end of the year sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ben next question please operator thank you the next question comes from mario ropero from fidentiis please go ahead mario ropero q analyst fidentiis hi good morning thank you for taking the questions the first one is about the cost to income in spain excluding trading income it seems still very weak so a couple of issues related to that could you help us understand banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 when you expect stabilization in the top line in spain and please could you give more details on cost savings in spain next year well next year current year and then finally in spain again could you give us some color on impairments in spain i mean your npl ratio is still very high coverage below peers so there is an obvious tradeoff between accelerating the reduction of npls and impairments could you give us some clarity on impairments thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yes let me just take that and then josé antonio please if you can complement but i understand spain this year costincome was which is actually not that bad if you consider negative rates and where other banks including the some of the large american banks are but we certainly aim to improve that and the cost savings for next year will continue i think were aiming for like something like midsingledigit but remember that the key numbers are europe because we have a number of transversal across the group european initiatives so that is what matters now i mean that is the great strength of santander its not a spanish bank its not a uk bank its a european bank with about billion i think we closed in and weve said wed reduce billion billion over the next few years so there are very significant savings coming in of that billion next year much more than this year i mean if this year it was about million we did have a change in perimeter this year were not expecting that for next year i understand but josé antonio maybe you can help me there so youd see not just spain but europe coming down significantly in the cost base next year impairments i mean and npls all of this obviously comes in great measure by popular do you want to comment on those please josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah yeah impairments its true that we have of the our peers in npls it comes from popular when you say these impairments so what i can tell you is we are reducing quite rapidly these npls and we expect to continue to do so with the cost of credit cost of risk that is going to be in line not below the one we have had this year so its true but we are i feel comfortable with the coverage we have but its true that its still is going to take a little of time to reduce the level to the level we should have that is currently above as a matter of comparison if you were on in santander business will be around or below yeah so and this is comes basically from this but the most important thing from the pl point of view the cost of risk is going to remain in line with what we have or slightly below and the cost probably to elaborate a little bit more on the cost side we reduced this year cost in spain million this is a nominal number probably next year were going to be aligned with this number again we are making a great effort and the popular integration is going to be reflected somehow were reflected this year but next year its going to come in the same line and in europe as ana mentioned our target was to reduce or is to reduce billion nominal cost down this year we got million what you see in the numbers is million you well have some changes in perimeter in poland and some others but the number is million this year probably next year probably it should be the double of this or around double of this nominal number going down in europe is coming from basically spain and uk banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks mario next question please operator thank you the next question comes from jose abad from goldman sachs please go ahead jose abad q analyst goldman sachs audio gap my first question is on capital in the quarter report you mentioned that part of the organic generation in the quarter was due to some riskweighted asset optimization so here i think i have two questions which is one is that you signed a risk sharing agreement with eib for a billion sme loan portfolio in spain i think that was in late october so the question here is whether the full impact from this scheme is already fully capture by q4 numbers or that we should expect the impact from this scheme to be accrued gradually over the next few quarters related to this topic is if you could tell us about whats the potential amount of capital cet1 that you plan to generate through the full implementation of your irb internal models rollout plan across the group and if i may one quickly on credit quality its clear that you are positive based on your last comment but we see divergent trends within the group so we see a margin a sequential increase in the cost of risk in santander consumer finance at the same time a meaningful decline in spain so i think i guess here it would be useful to have your view on whats driving actually better quality credit quality trends in your view in a context of a slower growth globally i mean particularly if you could also comment on what is the level and your expectations for the cost of risk in the consumer segment in spain thank you very much ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa okay on capital again we generated bps gross in i mean as i said before looking every quarter i understand sometimes that you expect more and other times less but what we have done is delivered across the year and this is what i would like to stress is we are very confident on the model on the predictability sustainability but its very difficult to measure quarters approvals and markets and so weve been very consistent for five years basis points per year when we needed to do more we have done more and weve done it i believe the right way by basically increasing thresholds in terms of assets that come on the books were ready to do that because our focus is on profitable growth but profitability is very important securitizations will continue i mean i will let josé antonio answer that very technical question although were going to see the impact next year internal models i mean as you know thats one of the factors both pluses and minuses for all european banks but we have higher much higher visibility now on whats coming and what the effects are and so thats why we are giving the guidance were giving we expect to be at given the profitability and given what we know today but i will let now josé antonio answer you on the what happened in q4 but there was a lot more securitization but we are using this as a bau tool by the way because we want to keep the customer relationships we think banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 that is very profitable business for the bank and we have thresholds and we securitize where it makes more sense in terms of returns on capital very briefly on credit quality across the group the cost of credit across the group this year was basis points and for next year i can give you guidance that it should be the same about basis points but there are some ups and downs im not sure how much guidance you want to give on that but josé antonio maybe you can take it from there josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah well you mentioned that the slower growth globally may affect our cost of risk i should say that i cannot agree with this yeah brazil is going to grow faster in than it grew in mexico is going to do the same so our main portfolios somehow were portfolios that have a relatively high cost of risk and we expect a better environment you referred specifically to santander consumer finance the gross provisions were pretty much the same in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter you saw in the fourth quarter higher provisions because we disposed less portfolios but the gross provisions were pretty much the same and in spain i already comment on these you mentioned the consumer segment in spain we are not seeing a particular trend in spain although ive seen in the media some numbers ticking up remember that our consumer lending in spain in consumer is basically auto lending is behaving very well is basically new cars is good quality and in the bank our loyal customers we is pregranted credits that will have a strong relationship with the customers you asked specifically for the eib eib what shows is our policy visàvis securitizations that the guide for our securitizations that is becoming as ana said businessasusual is we securiticize sic securitize as long as we can release capital free up capital at a cost that is well well below our cost of equity so and this is mainly its happening in our consumer finance operations both in both sides of the atlantic in scusa in the us and consumer finance in europe and will continue to do so i will qualify these as an asset businessasusual more than that we are doing something on our oneonone basis eib operation was included in q4 but is meaningless in terms of capital yeah its very small sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks jose next question please operator thank you the next question comes from ignacio ulargui from exane bnp please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas yeah hi good morning just have one question on the strategy in spain just a bit to understand when do you think the deleveraging of the loan book will finish we have seen again a year of weak lending growth i have a feeling that you are reshaping a lot the balance sheet focusing on more profitable segments but if you could just elaborate a bit on that and what would be the impact in nii for thanks banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so the deleveraging in spain has been mainly in the larger corporates i mean its sector continues to deleverage and probably the public sector as you well said were growing very well in consumer lending and i think our guidance for next year will be more stable so not a full but more stable volumes and actually were aiming for stable margins also on the customer side but i would like to flag that for next year also and you can see that because you can see that in the numbers this year there will be less of a financial revenues through the alco because we have disposed some portfolio so id say next year you should expect higher quality earnings in spain good management of margins stable volumes overall but less financial income josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah as a matter of fact the deleveraging you are seeing is driven by the our weve been selective being conscious of the good usage of capital in segments where the profitability is very low so weve been were elaborating the previous quarters around these and that affects as ana said the corporate the large corporates and institutions so those are the settlements in which we are now seeing a good use of our capital if we deploy there because profitability is relatively poor because the competition is extremely strong yeah sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ignacio next question please operator thank you the next question comes from marta romero from bank of america please go ahead marta sánchez romero q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning thank you very much for taking my questions the first one is a followup on capital do you expect the implementation of calendar provisions in all the npls to have a negative impact on capital by the end of and the second one is in the uk you seem to be committing more capital again in this market weve seen a growth in the quarter in mortgages is this something that will continue is this a bit of seasonality oneoffs have your views on the market generally changed because it looked like you were withdrawing from this market and now youre committing more capital and does your guidance on net interest income in the uk incorporate any potential interest rate cuts thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so we already have begun in even at the end of to manage really our capital on a group basis not just by countries but by segments and the return on capital of uk mortgages actually is attractive and thats the reason were growing on mortgages and so id say that its consistent with the deployment of capital but its also consistent with the fact that we have a great business and franchise in the uk and this is weve grown about billion in mortgages in the year but weve also grown very well for example on the business side the business account has grown really well so its consistent with the discipline in capital allocation across the uk and across the group banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 in terms of the provisions npl for next year i mean i mentioned some slight the answer is no but there will be some regulatory effects and its difficult to know is this going to be a net zero its going to slightly positive slightly negative but were ready for that as i said we can manage our balance sheet actively maybe not every quarter as weve seen over the last few years but every single year for the last five years weve delivered the basis points and this year again basis points with very strong generation organically as youve seen sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks marta next question please operator thank you the next question comes from fernando gil de santivanes from barclays please go ahead fernando gil de santivanes q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning thank you for taking my questions my question on spain so i understood that you aimed to continue improving the npl ratio and the coverage ratio going forward but i just want to clarify on that and the second question would be in the uk what is the actual balance of the svr book and what is the impact on that in the nii thank you very much ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so ill answer the uk i know better than to answer spain so svr balances will come down much less next year i think this year it came down by about billion and next year will be coming down less than that i think somewhere between billion to billion so youll have a lot less impact next year again what we are working very hard is also on the efficiency side and ensuring were doing more and more mortgages online with a much better return in terms of efficiency i think that is the answer on svr npls josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well npl ratio i already elaborate on this i said that i expect the npl ratio to keep going down significantly in spain the coverage ratio you mentioned depends more on the kind of collateralized or noncollateralized loans that we have but normally and it should happen the same in the collateralized loan tend to stay longer in the balance sheet than noncollateralized loans so very likely the coverage will remain flat or slightly down depending on if the npls are collateralized or not that is the main factor returning the coverage ratio you have recovered value or you dont have recovered value plenty of the npls that we inherit from popular comes from the sme segment and while those tend to be lower collateralized naturally than the mortgages and for that reason this is what drives the coverage ratios more than a specific policy ph supply in ifrs suspected loss taking into account collateralization of the npls yeah sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks fernando next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 operator thank you the next question comes from sofie peterzéns from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzéns q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan so i wanted just to follow up on the core equity tier of the basis point improvement that we saw quarteronquarter in the fourth quarter is there anything that could potentially reverse in coming quarters that we should be aware of and then the second question would be how should we think about your dividend per share going forward buybacks ma should we expect the dividend per share to remain stable around or do you have the intentions to grow that and my last question would be on cecl in the us did you see any big impact from the new provisioning requirements in the us thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so ill start by the last one cecl would not have an impact on group josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa its in local accounting ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa its local accounting josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa local accounting its not group accounting ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yeah and its been reported by santander consumer i believe its about billion something like this impact i think that has been informed already in q3 so theres nothing new there and again no impact on the group in terms of dividend so what we are focusing very much is on the cash dividend per share our intention is to get rid of the scrip but its also important to consider our retail shareholders and again thats what we said again because its difficult to predict everything thats going to happen during the year our aim is to first to on the underlying results second that the cash dividend per share should be as much as possible aligned with the underlying growth in our profits and i think that is what were doing this year if we look at underlying profit growth its around and thats what we are proposing in terms of the increase in the cash dividend per share total dividend will stay stable so the scrip is reduced its now only so again weve returned to shareholders over these five years billion which shows the confidence of management and the board in the sustainability of our results and this is something which we expect to be hopefully reflected soon also in the market so this is the policy we are not changing that its stable and well be proposing this to the shareholders in april banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 there is nothing in the quarter there is some negative regulatory headwinds which were actually anticipating for next year because we have information on that so at basis points i believe theres more securitizations and less growth in riskweighted assets than in other quarters but again its a bit of a seasonal impact in that sense less growth but also more securitizations happening in the fourth quarter youre going to get volatility interquarterly thats for sure we have some acquisitions coming in we also have some divestments and the timing of that per quarter is difficult to calculate again what is important is management and the boards confidence that at the level and the buffers against regulatory requirements are very comfortable and by the way the future because basel iv and what happens ahead i think that the very important signal is were able to deliver profitability growth and were able to manage our balance sheet to accommodate this kind of instances like we had this year with basis points which we dont anticipate to be obviously anywhere near those levels for the next three years josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa no reversion in the basis points at all yeah going forward ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa no well of course yeah i mean that is this is no reversion thank you josé antonio to be clear no reversal on the country thank you sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks sofie next question please operator thank you the next question comes from stefan nedialkov from citigroup please go ahead stefan r nedialkov q analyst citigroup global markets ltd hi guys good morning its stefan from citi a couple of questions on my side i try not to beat a dead horse here but you did mention strategic flexibility on capital when you get closer to cet1 just wanted to get more color on what do you mean by strategic do you mean ma or do you mean just generally being able to face organic growth opportunities regulatory challenges et cetera so is it ma that you meant or nonma and the second question is on the divisions mexican fees seem to be down mexican loan growth half of the yearly growth seem to be bunched up in yes that is seasonal but still big skew towards whats going on there it looks like its corporate and government lending any color for would be good as well and in another division in the us the cost of deposits seems to be going up quite a bit while loan repricing is down obviously because of lower rates how should we think about these quite different dynamics why are deposits going up so much in terms of cost thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yes in terms of what happens when we dont have to accumulate more capital i mean strategic flexibility means we can choose to either increase dividends faster we can buy back shares of course but very importantly we have a lot of opportunities for profitable growth so we will have to find a balance between these options there is no plans for ma weve always said ma would be very disciplined we in our core markets when theres and weve done this in certain places over the last couple of years we will be very strict in our criteria we have seen opportunities we have not taken those opportunities over the last few years and in a couple of instances we have because it added to the franchise and the return was accretive after two three years which is the benchmark which we have set i will answer the us and ill let josé antonio answer on mexico but i think the us is very important so id say on the us we have really made exceptional and i mean exceptional progress over the last couple of years weve grown profits doubledigit in and we can guide to again doubledigit growth in in the us we have three important blocks one is the consumer finance thats a business that has a huge excess capital but even with that excess capital is at around return on tangible equity second is that there are very strong links which we are now capitalizing not just within the us but with the group just to give you an example of how were improving the profitability and were going to do more of this and by the way i just joined the us board because i want to make sure we understand that better how the organic growth is possible of the originations in of santander consumer were prime auto loans which are on the balance sheet of sbna its now of the sbna loans coming from originations at santander consumer this also improves the profitability of consumer because its becoming it already is a bestinclass servicer again very high return on that business so and there are examples i dont want to take too long but there are examples on the midcorp segment with sbna in mexico sbna in the uk which is increasingly integrated were investing together in technology also the last point id like to make on margins and its possible that the deposit cost might have risen slightly but whats important is that the yearonyear in terms of current accounts of our bank and very importantly on the experience is one of the best in its peer group and the overall in the region and for the regional banks the margins are much more attractive than they are in europe so were trying to bring our knowledge and what weve learned in terms of managing the business in europe at much lower margins to actually all of the americas so were guiding again to doubledigit growth in the us next year and getting to the targets that we announced in investor day so i hope the specific on the quarter honestly i dont know if sergio josé antonio the deposit cost in the quarter and sbna but josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well as a matter of fact who grew faster in relatively highcost deposits we are going the other way around it depends on the deposit growth who grew and who grew faster in kind of institutional deposits that are more expensive yeah sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa yeah well followup offline stefan but the cost of the deposit of sbna went down on a quarterly basis is at the lowest so consistent with the rating in the us but well followup if thats okay with you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 stefan r nedialkov q analyst citigroup global markets ltd yes ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yeah sorry just a followup so i said the building blocks and i just realized i just commented on two of them so we have three building blocks one is santander consumer which is well known very profitable the other sbna clearly theres work to be done might i say that for the last few years we could not do even launching i mean it was very difficult for us to grow even organically because of our regulatory situation thats changing again were going to be able to do more activities and you should see that coming in in but theres a third very profitable block or also which is wealth management which is less known we are very good at this were growing that really well its part of the global wealth management and asset insurance division and we have billion under management okay and that is the third us highly profitable scalable business which is in the us and well have increasing connections to sbna as we go forward and have more flexibility sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and were getting out of time josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa in mexico let me elaborate a little bit in mexico mexico has in the quarter a number that are mixed by accounting issues so you have gross income growing quarteronquarter that is a very growth and you have some impact coming from the corporate business the corporate investment banking business that produce capital gains and reduce the net interest income and its a translation from one line to another if you look at the gross income we are growing quarteronquarter that is at very healthy rate going forward we are as i said in the presentation optimistic about mexico indiscernible grew in the economy was basically flat no growth and we expect better trends in and growing the franchise along these lines its true that we while this market consensus is expecting some slowdown in reduction into rates that may affect something but we have plenty of room to reduce our deposit cost so overall im optimistic about our capacity to keep growing revenues in mexico yeah sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks stefan next question please operator thank you the next question comes from carlos cobo from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hello thank you for the presentation sorry i think the message on capital is super clear but sorry to go back to the specifics because the basel iv impact before used to be basis points to basis points i know theres been a lot of discussion around the quarter here could you please explain is that guidance doesnt change or you just preferred to keep it more flexible which is kind of what i understood banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 and secondly on again sorry asset quality in spain id like to understand your point of view santander has always taking a probably more risk here you retain a larger stake in the jv that you sold with the nonperforming assets of popular and now you seem to be retaining a larger share of nonperforming assets you are now having a npl ratio substantially above the average in spain i want to understand why arent you taking a more aggressive approach is just because you see more value there or because you are trying to protect capital and lastly if you could just guide us if you werent able to if you decide to do so could you sell a big block as your other peers have done in spain thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa okay on basel iv i would like to say that i and we are very confident that basel iv can be easily and let me stress easily absorbed whilst maintaining both an attractive dividend policy and financing profitable growth and why do i say this because for five years we have a strong track record five years of basis points annual organic capital generation and also we are continuously transforming our model again we absorbed basis points actually basis points exactly on regulatory impacts we grew loans at we are proposing to increase the cash dps close to the basis points guidance that was given in q3 was very preliminary and it was incomplete in the sense that it was pre mitigation beyond there are of course other regulatory impacts at play not just the negative but for example as i mentioned the capital treatment of intangibles which would have a net positive for santander and last but not least santander should be lower impact than peers but again let me stress that we as management today have precise tools to manage on a quarterly basis and even more on a yearly basis our lets say the our risk weighted assets and how much business we put on the books we are working on a originate to distribute model which were already implementing so we have a much much bigger flexibility and that is the high confidence were giving you on capital but were keeping the to because we believe that is the right target and again because we think is a comfortable level and gives us comfortable buffers i would say even and ive said very comfortable buffers against the regulatory requirements i hope that answers the question and there were two more which maybe josé antonio can take josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah i was asset quality in spain if the question if i understood well if it was if we are changing our policy toward disposing the nonperforming loans from nonperforming assets the sure answer is no weve done plenty of deals as you know we incorporate companies merlin metrovacesa landmark in quasar we dispose indiscernible we continue to analyze our portfolios and to analyze the possibility to dispose in a market at a price were price conscious but youre suggesting that we may be slowing down our disposal of the portfolios because capital issues i tell you that is more well continue with the same policy we are conscious of the pricing and well continue to reduce our npls our nonperforming assets in line with our traditional way of managing these issues yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks carlos next question operator thank you the next question comes from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes thank you for taking my questions theyre followups on capital can you please update us on the pending regulatory hurdles of with the split the guidance was basis points to basis points on the q3 call youve taken over basis points in can you just confirm there is basis points to basis points left for and also following up on the developments on the regulatory front the approval of crd v and in particular of article do you intend to use it how and when and what needs to happen for you to use it in your view and does the progress of cet1 that youve made your positive capital outlook and the more constructive regulatory environment allow you to implement a more visible dividend policy for the future thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so again the guidance for on regulatory effect is we have taken some in q4 actually because we had a very strong performance so weve taken about a third of that so i think the basis points basis points could be more like basis points basis points next year but again there some inorganic also positives and negatives again we have said we expect to be close to which is the upper end of the range that we set and which were not changing that guidance in terms of crd v my understanding if this gets approved in january of we havent really looked at the at what this means so were not counting on that in our guidance but obviously it could provide flexibility because you could cover some of the cet1 with pillar ii and the approval is expected in january that could be an upside which again were not counting but could come into force in maybe or after that and in terms of the dividend policy well we believe we have a very clear dividend policy but im not sure what more we can say we can say that to on an underlying i think id mentioned before that the cash dps we would like that it increases our aim is that it increases in line with the underlying profit growth the aim is to reduce the strip but we believe that for now the flexibility is good not because of institutions which we know youre not that keen but because our retail investors like it and the reason we got to approval to repurchase shares is that because as the year goes by to ensure that we do what we commit we like to have that extra flexibility to be very honest because theres been less visibility on regulatory issues and that gave us some extra flexibility but were reducing that again this year to so that is the dividend policy that we have set and approved and i think i answered both questions thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa thanks andrea next and last question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 operator thank you the next question comes from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi hello good morning thank you for taking my question so the first question would actually be on the fees particularly in spain this quarter wasnt particularly strong ive seen the explanation regarding investment banking fees i was wondering if you could shed some light on how you see it evolving over the next quarters or over the next years basically this is the line that some of your peers have flagged not particularly a positive stance on i was wondering whats your view on that secondly on nii in brazil if you could give us also some views on how you see it evolving you mentioned that youre expecting to compensate some of the pressure in margin with volume growth but i was wondering how do you see the nii figure itself evolving but whats the netnet of these two basically and then as a followup question on capital just basically into in the next years so you have this guidance of on the considering the transitional arrangement of ifrs could you remind us what will be the impact from the phasing in of these transitional arrangements in thank you very much ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa so theres still i think theres basis points left on ifrs thats in basis points josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa basis points now and i think up to next year it will be basis points or basis points ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a executive chairman banco santander sa yeah and that factors obviously thats factor in on a yearbyyear basis so basis points right so do you want to answer the other questions thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well the other question were fees in spain and how do we see this evolving in coming quarters we have had some impacts from cib businesses here in the fee income weve been sharing with you this excib we have some translation we expect lower funding cost that impacts indiscernible you show the changes in account you can elaborate your numbers in relation with this probably positive in nim some negative in fee income and cib well depends on the year the activity we see on the year as you know we are the market leader in cib in spain and well how the market evolves affect us significantly the second question was nii in brazil well i said in the presentation that we expect in brazil with a gdp growing north of a healthy growth in volumes and with some margin pressure some of those you already know the main one was the cap on overdraft that has a significant impact for that reason we expect some margin pressure we expect to be in clearly in positive territory in brazil in net interest income with pressures coming from regulatory side the most important one you already know is the cap on overdraft that went down from to on a monthly basis banco santander sa san corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 basically thats it we are fairly positive in fee income in brazil where we expect to keep growing given the market share gains that we are getting on the level of current seasonality we are having the insurance payments and private banking business should support a healthy growth probably into double digit in brazil in sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa okay im afraid we need to leave it here so thanks ana and josé antonio for your time and obviously the ir team is at your disposal for any followup in detail so thanks very much everyone ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea executive chairman banco santander sa thank you very
