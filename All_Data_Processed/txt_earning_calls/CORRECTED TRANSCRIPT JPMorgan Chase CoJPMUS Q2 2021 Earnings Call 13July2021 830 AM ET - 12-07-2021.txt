management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases second quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your lines will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator good morning everyone before we get going id just like to say how honored i am to be on my first earnings call following the footsteps of marianne and jen both of whom taught me so much during my time working for them and whose shoes will be very difficult to fill but im going to try so with that this presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of these results include billion of credit reserve releases which ill cover in more detail shortly jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 touching on a few highlights combined debit and credit spend was up yearonyear and more importantly up versus the more normal precovid second quarter of it was an alltime record for ib fees up yearonyear driven by advisory and underwriting we saw particularly strong growth in awm with record long term flows as well as record revenue and finally credit continues to be quite healthy as evidenced by our exceptionally low net chargeoffs across the board regarding our balance sheet the trend from recent quarters have largely continued deposits are up year onyear and sequentially and loan growth remains low flat yearonyear and up quarteronquarter although we have bright spots in certain pockets and the consumer spend trends are encouraging so now turning to page for more detail as i go through this page im going to provide you some context about the prioryear quarter because the year onyear comparisons are a bit noisy so with respect to revenue the second quarter of was an alltime record for markets with revenue of over billion and we recorded approximately million of gains in our bridge book with that in mind revenue of billion was down billion or yearonyear noninterest revenue was down billion or due to the prioryear items i just mentioned partially offset by strong fee generation in investment banking and awm as well as from cardrelated fees on higher spend and net interest income was down billion or driven by lower markets nii and lower balances in card expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely on continued investments and then on credit costs going back to last year again you will recall in last years second quarter we built billion in credit reserves during the height of the pandemic whereas this year we released billion so in this quarter credit costs were a net benefit of billion and setting aside the reserve release its also worth noting that net chargeoffs of just over million were half of last years second quarter number and continued to trend near historical lows on the next page lets go over the reserves we released billion this quarter as we grow increasingly confident about the economy in light of continued improvement in covid especially in the us in consumer we released billion including billion in card and million in home lending and in wholesale we released nearly million so this leaves us with reserves of billion which as a result of elevated remaining uncertainty about covid and the shape of the economic recovery are higher than would otherwise be implied by our central economic forecast now moving to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of down slightly versus the prior quarter as net growth in retained earnings was more than offset by higher rwa across both retail and wholesale lending this quarter also reflects the expiration of the temporary slr experience and as we anticipated leverage is now our binding constraint as you know we finished ccar a couple of weeks ago and our scb will be which reflects the boards intention to increase the dividend to per share in the third quarter okay now lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of billion including reserve releases of billion on revenue of billion up yearonyear of particular note this quarter is the acceleration of card spend and so while card outstanding remain lower than prepandemic levels this quarters trends make us optimistic total debit and credit spend was up yearonyear and more importantly up versus the second quarter of and within that compared to june total spend was up indicating some healthy acceleration throughout the quarter and travel and entertainment has really turned a corner with spend flat versus the second jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 quarter of accelerating from down in april to actually up in june the rest of the ccb story remains consistent with prior quarters consumer and small business cash balances remain elevated resulting in depressed loan growth overall loans were down yearonyear from continued elevated prepayments in mortgage and on lower card outstanding partially offset by strong growth in auto and the impact of ppp home lending and auto continued to have strong originations with home lending up to billion the highest quarterly figure since the third quarter of and auto up to a record billion deposits were up yearonyear or approximately billion and client investment assets were up driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels and our omni channel strategy continues to deliver we are more than halfway through our initial market expansion commitment as we have opened more than new branches out of our goal of which have exceeded our expectations by generating billion in deposits and investments and we are planning to be in all contiguous states by the end of the summer digital trends continue to be strong as retail mobility recovers at a faster pace than branch transactions which are still down more than versus active mobile users grew yearonyear to over million and total digital transactions per engaged customer were up expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by continued investments and higher volume and revenuerelated expenses looking forward the obvious question is the outlook for loan growth especially in card and we are quite optimistic that the current spend trends will convert into resumption of loan growth through the end of this year and into next and while we wait the exceptionally low level of net chargeoffs provides substantial offset to the nii headwind next the corporate investment bank on page cib reported net income of billion and an roe of on revenue of billion ib fees of billion were up yearonyear and up quarteronquarter an all time record driven by advisory and debt underwriting leading to a yeartodate global ib wallet share of and a number one ranking in advisory we were up yearonyear benefiting from the surge in announcement activity that has continued into the second quarter debt underwriting fees were up driven by an active acquisition finance market offset by lower investment grade issuance and in equity underwriting fees were up primarily driven by a strong performance in ipos the resulting investment banking revenue of billion was roughly flat yearonyear due to the headwind of the prioryears markup in the bridge book looking ahead to the third quarter the pipeline remains very strong we expect ma activity and the ipo markets to remain active and while ib fees are likely to be down sequentially we still expect them to be up yearonyear moving to markets total revenue was billion down compared to an alltime record quarter last year while normalization has been more prevalent in macro overall we ran above levels throughout the quarter on the back of strong client activity outperforming our own expectations from earlier in the year fixed income was down compared to last years exceptional results but up compared to the second quarter of equity markets was up driven by record balances in prime as well as strong performance in cash and equity derivatives where we matched last years great results looking forward while we expect normalization to continue across both investment banking and markets and most notably in fixed income the timing and the extent of the normalization is obviously hard to predict jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 wholesale payments revenue was billion up driven by higher deposits and fees largely offset by deposit margin compression and securities services revenue was billion down as deposit margin compression was predominantly offset by growth in deposits and fees expenses of billion were down yearonyear driven by lower performancerelated compensation partially offset by higher volumerelated expense moving to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was up yearonyear with higher investment banking lending and wholesale payments revenue largely offset by lower deposit revenue and the absence of a prioryear equity investment gain record gross investment banking revenue of billion was up on increased ma and acquisitionrelated financing activity compared to prioryear lows expenses of million were up yearon year driven by higher volume and revenuerelated expenses and investments deposits of billion were up yearonyear as client balances remain elevated loans of billion were down yearonyear driven by lower revolver utilization compared to the prioryear quarter and down sequentially ci loans were down quarteronquarter with lower utilization partially offset by new loan activity in middle market and cre loans were down but we saw pockets of growth in affordable housing activity finally credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by reserve releases with net chargeoffs of only basis point and to complete our lines of business on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of and an roe of record revenue of billion was up yearonyear as higher management fees and growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up year onyear driven by higher performancerelated compensation and distribution expenses for the quarter net long term inflows of billion continued to be positive across all channels with notable strength in equities fixed income and alternatives aum was trillion and for the first time overall client assets were over trillion up and yearonyear respectively driven by higher market levels and strong net inflows and finally loans were up yearonyear with continued strength in securitiesbased lending custom lending and mortgages while deposits were up turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of billion revenue was a loss of billion down million yearonyear nii was down million primarily on limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued and we realized million of net investment securities losses in the quarter expenses of million were up million yearonyear so with that on page the outlook our nii outlook of around billion remains in line with the updated guidance we provided last month but as youll note weve also lowered our outlook for the card net chargeoff rate to less than basis points which as i mentioned in ccb provides a meaningful offset to the nii headwind and its worth mentioning that the current environment makes forecasting nii even in the near term unusually challenging so while billion remains our current central case you should expect some elevated uncertainty around that number not only because of the ongoing impact of stimulus on consumer balance sheet but also due to volatility coming from markets among other things and as a reminder most of any fluctuation in markets nii whether up or down is likely to be offset in nir jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 on expenses weve increased our guidance to approximately billion driven by higher volume and revenue related expenses so to wrap up we are encouraged by continued progress against the virus and the economic recovery that is underway especially in the united states although we want to acknowledge the challenges that much of the rest of the world is facing and were hopeful that a global recovery will follow closely behind our performance this quarter once again showcases the power of our diversified business model as headwinds in nii from consumer delevering are offset by strong fee generation across awm and cib and exceptionally low net chargeoffs across the board while were proud of the performance of the company and of our people through the crisis the competition in every business from banks fintechs and others is as intense as ever so as we look forward to an increasingly normal environment were enthusiastically focused on competing for every piece of share in every market product and business where we operate and making the necessary investments to win with that operator please open the line for qa question and answer section operator and our first question is coming from the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open now jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi there hi jeremy welcome welcome to the party jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you very much glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi a question on nii if i could and apologize if its a little multifaceted so even though were getting some inflationary data and youre positively inclined on the economy ph as if my rates fell not sure you want to opine why but lets talk about you kept the nii guide im assuming because deposit growth is strong curious your thoughts on consumer payment rates staying at this elevated level deposit growth staying at this elevated level and then most importantly if youre managing the balance sheet any differently meaning you had been slow playing putting money to work rates are even lower now are you still slow playing putting money to work appreciate it thanks jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks glenn all right so lets sort of take that in parts so in terms of our nii guidance yeah so were reiterating billion for the full year so just to take your deployment point first obviously rates are a little bit lower longend rates are a little bit lower the curve has flattened a little bit since we provided that guidance but when we provided that guidance we were reasonably conservative in our deployment assumptions through the rest of the year so as a result of that its not really a meaningful factor sort of at the level of precision that were talking about here in terms of the consumer side as you say obviously its really card thats really going to be the big driver so you heard us talking about payment rates and you see the sequential growth in card loans so we do believe that the sort of acceleration and the pickup in spend is going to translate to as i say resumption of loan growth in card but we do think that pay rates are going to remain quite elevated at a minimum through the end of this year so as a result we dont really see revolving interestbearing balances increasing meaningfully this year and so as a result that remains a headwind for the overall nii for this year which is incorporated in the outlook glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay and then in terms of managing balance sheet any differently in terms of putting money to work youre still conversative on that front jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah look i mean i think youve heard us talk about this before right so our central case from an economic perspective is for a very robust recovery and thats pretty much a consensus a view between us our research team the fed et cetera and that view is associated with higher inflation along the lines of the feds own target for higher inflation all those things together its an outlook thats associated with higher rates all else equal and so in light of all that we do remain happy to stay patient here and if you look at our eir disclosure which you obviously wont see until you get the q but some of you guys have written about this recently our overall sensitivities are kind of inline with the industry so when you consider kind of the tail type things that jamie always talks about the convexity of the balance sheet and various other factors we do still feel that being patient here makes sense glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay and just one quickie on the recent both acquisitions and investments and you or jamie could feel free to take it im curious on a big picture is it just coincidence that there have been five things in a very short period of time and maybe if you want to expand on maybe nutmeg specifically and why the change in terms of shying away from international expansion in the past and now making a little bit better move in i appreciate it thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure glenn so let me start with the international expansion point on the consumer side because thats interesting youve heard jamie over the years talk about why it wouldnt really make sense to do international expansion in consumer when you think about that through the lens of a branchbased strategy so if you imagine going outside of the us and opening branches in other countries and competing with the incumbents just from a jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 branding perspective from an operating leverage perspective weve never felt that that was likely to be a successful strategy for us and that hasnt really changed the difference right now is the ability to do that digitally so whats really particularly exciting about the international expansion narrative both in the uk and now with our recent investment in c6 in brazil is the ability to kind of experiment a little bit obviously its a strategically compelling opportunity brazil as you probably know is like the third biggest consumer banking market in the world but its kind of fun to be the disruptor and so i think for us given our position in consumer banking in the united states being in a place where we are actually the outsider disrupting through these kind of digital channels we see it among other things in addition to being compelling financially as a really good opportunity to learn and to challenge ourselves a little bit from the inside so were quite excited about that stuff glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right thanks very much jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks glenn operator our next question is coming from the line of john mcdonald from autonomous research please go ahead your line is open now jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning jeremy i wanted to ask you about capital you mentioned leverage is now the binding constraint and jenn has previously talked about a cet1 target i guess could you talk about the multiple variables that youre balancing as you guys decide what capital levels to run at youve got a rising gsib score an slr cushion thats shrinking but maybe the rules get revised and obviously an scb that came down a little bit but maybe youre hoping for more how are you wrapping that all together into what kind of capital levels to target jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a good question john and yeah there are a lot of variables so let me start by saying that in terms of the target its not off the table is what ill say about that meaning doesnt necessarily need to be higher so for now its not off the table but the element of time ie when are we bound by what matters quite a bit as you think about this so just to go through some of the pieces youve noted the gsib point so were in the bucket now as of the end of last year that comes into play in were currently operating in as you know thats quite a jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 seasonal number so its still possible to get under for the end of this year but we have to acknowledge an elevated probability i would say of lending in bucket this year but the bucket would be binding in and as you noted in the meantime were bound by slr and weve been quite public about our views about these things about the extent to which increasingly our capital requirements are driven by nonrisk sensitive sizebased measures which were really designed especially in the case of slr as backstops which the fed has acknowledged so our priority and the fed has talked about potentially addressing some of these things we know were waiting for an npr on slr but also theyve said that a potential gsib fix could come as part of the holistic implementation of the basel iii endgame so theres a lot of things that are going to play out between now and some of those minimums becoming binding and realistically right now were going to be operating above anyway in light of the leveragebound in all likelihood so were managing a variety of different factors nearterm shortterm perhaps common et cetera and were just going to try to be nimble about it as more information comes out over the next few quarters jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co ph and can i just also make a supportive further point we have tons of capital billion of cet1 billion of preferred billion of longterm debt only trillion of loan which is the riskiest asset we have and trillion of cash and marketable securities so the underlying thing is theres just tons of capital in the system and one day youre going to look at it and say why so much ph particularly the liquid side jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and then a quick followup jeremy on expenses you revised the fiscal year outlook upward a few times now could you give a little more detail on the business volumes and revenues that are driving this and also we hear a lot about inflation across the economy are we seeing broader inflation play a role in your companys expenses and outlook jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so couple of things there so yeah as you note we have revised up from billion to billion and the biggest single driver there is volume and revenuerelated expense where jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible its just comp jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 its comp but its always indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the comp were going to be competitive in comp no matter what it takes so just keep that in the back of your mind jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co it is a little bit of comp its also transactionrelated volumes its also marketing expense in certain pockets so its all the stuff that fits in the category of volume and revenuerelated and i think the point is obviously were all a little bit focused on the nii headwinds right now but from an nir perspective across markets awm ib cib in general and even pockets wealth management and ccb were actually outperforming the revenue expectations that were builtin for our prior expense guidance so thats kind of the dynamic there in terms of inflation i would say that were not seeing inflation in our actuals but obviously your guess is as good as mine in terms of the future but it would be reasonable to assume that thats going to be a little bit of a challenge to a greater or lesser degree if the economy as a whole is in a slightly higher inflationary environment and we did probably include a little bit of that expectation in the billion for this year john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thanks operator our next question is coming from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead your line is open now kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning jeremy if i could just followup on your points about capital and just how we should be thinking about well you gave us clarity on the dividend and we know theres the billion open authorization on the buyback again just kind of fitting for the middle there how do you balance just the magnitude of buyback you do from here versus the ongoing growth that we have in the balance sheet visàvis what you just talked about as far as the limitations thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i mean the answer to how we balance it is we talk about it a lot we have a lot of smart people looking at it trying to balance all of the different constraints that were managing and i think jenn talked before especially when it comes to the balance between our riskbased minimums and the slr constraint which as you know we can address with prefs with that kind of the mixture of prefs and common so were looking at that i think rrp is helping a little bit on the deposit growth side which helps a little bit with the management of slr but as i said previously were going to stay nimble there and use the tools at our disposal to try to strike the right balance between buybacks and pref issuance recognizing that overissuing prefs potentially locks us into high jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 cost prefs with low flexibility because of the fiveyear lockout so theres a lot of balancing there and were just staying nimble as information potentially trickles out on the evolution of the rules kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just so then as far as how you guys will communicate well just find out about the buyback on a quarterly basis as opposed to you giving a more broad outlook of your expectations around buybacks as it happened more in the past is that fair jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think thats right especially in the new environment that were operating in from a buyback perspective now that its not sort of an approved plan through ccar but is rather just the overall billion board authorization given what i just talked about in terms of the need to stay nimble across multiple constraints we wouldnt want to box ourselves in by speaking publicly ahead of time in terms of what were going to do and you know obviously our normal capital hierarchy at the end of the day were always going to invest first and look at interesting acquisitions and pay a single dividend and at the end of that well look at buybacks in the context of all the other factors jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we could probably give you a more definitive thing after they finish basel iii which is now years in making and slr and all the updates and then youll have more certainty about how this thing operates going forward kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks a lot guys appreciate it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks john i mean ken sorry operator our next question is coming from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities please go ahead your line is open now james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just to followup on the card business you had quarteroverquarter growth in balances but i think your guidance was still a little cautious is that just being conservative youre still not sure about the relationship between spend and balance growth or how do we think about the good quarter and sort of that cautious outlook jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 yeah so i wouldnt use the word conservative weve tried very hard in our outlook to give you central case number so were going to be wrong but hopefully well be wrong symmetrically so we really want to try hard to give you central case numbers that dont have baseless optimism or unnecessary conservatism in them so the point that you highlight the sort of apparent disconnect between the sequential increase in card loans and the relatively muted nii outlook is really just about pay rates so we continue to see very elevated pay rates by historical standards really highly unusual as a result of some of the themes that we called out in terms of the strength of the consumer balance sheet so as long as thats true and were seeing sort of unusually low conversion of spend into revolving balances thats going to be a little bit of an nii headwind until the consumer starts to relever which we do think will happen we just dont think its likely to be a meaningful effect this year james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thats fair and then on the chargeoffs thats always been a big benefit i think if we look at delinquencies both early stage and later stage they kept falling throughout the quarter is there anything unusual this quarter where we saw a pretty big drop should we expect further declines in ncos as the year progresses given delinquency trends jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think on chargeoffs i would just stick to the updated card guidance that we gave which is lower just saying that its going to be below but again its the same themes right like elevated cash buffers in consumers are resulting in exceptionally strong nco performance and sort of upside to prices in terms of people paying so theyre sort of two sides of the same coin right now lower revolving balances better ncos and then as we continue returning to normal presumably in you should see both of those come back slightly to historical trends james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc great fair enough thanks operator our next question is coming from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is open now jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey mike indiscernible mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc welcome hey jeremy welcome my question i want to follow up i think glenn asked jamie for the answer to this question so im going to try again these acquisitions that youve done i count eight since december and the question is jamie what is the strategy is the strategy i guess in some cases its to disrupt the new markets as jeremy said maybe its to avoid cost maybe its to scale across tens of millions of customers jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 or and this is the real question are you looking to connect some of these acquisitions like nutmeg with i cant remember the kraft analytics maxex c6 bank openinvest 55ip is the goal to somehow one plus one plus one to equal more than three as you introduce these acquisitions these companies these people to each other to create kind of like a 21st century digital banking storefront or is that too much of a reach whats the grand plan here jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co a little bit too much of a reach but theres a very smart analyst who said its a string of pearls and id put it in that category so asset management campbell is just managing lumber assets timber assets is going to be a great thing for asset management 55ip adds taxefficient management to it there obviously nutmeg and were already doing in uk will be linked together offering consumer digital products both in deposits small business eventually lending and investments roboinvesting et cetera makes sense c6 is another one jeremy said its a huge market so were looking at anything which has adjacencies it could be data it could be management a lot of these youre going to fill and some are a little bit more of a skunkworks so how we look at retail digital overseas weve got patience and time and were going to spend a lot of time to see if we can build something very different than we have in the united states and so its a little bit of everything cxloyalty and the travel company again if you look at that we are already so large in the travel business so think of this as enhanced services and products and capabilities ph to help our clients travel packages et cetera which we already i forgot the number ph i think theyre the seventh largest travel company in the united states and that doesnt include all the travel that goes across our credit card and debit card thats travel but we arent effectively the travel agent and so its a little bit of all of that im thrilled were doing it were looking all the time were not going to end up with a lot of wasted assets but some of these things may not work but thatd be okay jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and mike the only thing i would add is there is a couple of themes to me come through some of the things weve done recently one of them is esg you see that especially in the awm deals and the other is just improving the customer experience whether its through various fintech deals or cxloyalty customer experience is a key priority for us and we want to have all the tools necessary to deliver that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and equally important were putting a lot of money into building we have like every quarter for the next two years youre going to have new products and new services being rolled out across the company that is just i think its just exciting and very good and more and more integrated and more and more simple to use and more and more customerfriendly et cetera and so were doing a little bit of all of that and indiscernible mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sorry jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc ive just got my followup as you talked about disrupting i thought that was interesting disrupting and the uk but since you wrote your ceo letter jamie i mean its only gotten more competitive from the fintech and big tech and being retail and everybody else and thats a question that comes up probably with everyone on this call are you going to be disintermediated over the next five years whether its you know all the companies but it just seems like theyre ramping up that much more you have an executive order from the white house maybe you have to share data whats your current marktomarket of the threat from outside of banking to your business jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i dont feel any different than when i wrote the chairmans letter i think we have huge competition in banking and shadow banking and fintech and big tech and now walmart and obviously its always a changing landscape but we also have a huge we got brands and capability and products and services and market share and profitability i think some of these competitors are going to do quite well i think a lot of them will succeed over time but thats called good old american capitalism im quite comfortable well do fine i do think there are going to be a lot of people struggling in the banking business im talking over or or years i think one day theyre going to call indiscernible shadow bank indiscernible banks who will be shadows of themselves jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah indiscernible mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thanks jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co were working hard to make sure that were offering services that are not disruptable because theyre good so if our clients are happy and were providing them a good experience then theres nothing to disrupt mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thanks jeremy thanks jamie jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 operator our next question is coming from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead your line is open now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thanks for taking my question i guess just sticking with the digital strategy weve heard jamie talk about multiple times around the lack of imagination that cost the banking industry in terms of either payments or buy now pay later and you talked about your international expansion but again going back to mikes point as shareholders of banks in the us should the expectation be that banks will be fastfollowers of what fintech comes up with and replicating that given the risk of cannibalizing your own sort of revenue set or do we expect or do you think we should expect more disruptive innovation coming from banks in the united states on consumer banking jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think its both i mean its not an eitheror question remember a lot of these banks have done quite well including bank of america has done quite well with some digital products and stuff like that so when i talk about lack of imagination i mean the whole company and when we look at some of these things it was we could have imagined why they become the competitor down the road so some of these competitors are quite good i call it bobbing and weaving ph they sell one little thing they have products they have services they have eyeballs they have customers and they find ways to monetize it so we got to be a little more forward looking in how theyre looking indiscernible stuff like that but in our case itll be a little bit of everything jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and i would just say the whole cannibalization and fast following thing i think weve moved a little bit beyond that like there will be times where we have the first idea and were eager to lean in and innovate that way there will be times when someone else has the first idea and were eagerly copying it but the whole oh we dont want to do this thing that makes sense for the customer because we might be cannibalizing our own revenues thats a recipe to become a shadow of your former self jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we have no problem cannibalizing the revenue just indiscernible we will do the right thing when the time comes and sometimes were a day late a dollar short but well do the right thing and just when we look at the company i mean we talk about slr i mean i always get ph talk about cecl and slr but look at the flows across this company look at the debit card the credit card the trading flows the market share thats what i look at much more than what are the ups and downs of the earnings this quarter because of cecl i dont think that means anything for the future of the company i mean our bankers our traders our credit card our debit card our merchant services our auto business our digitization its doing pretty good ph i wouldnt be disappointed my god the companys doing quite fine and yeah we like to be a little critical of ourselves ph because i think if companies arent thats part of their failure they should look at what they didnt do well and what other people have done well and be prepared and ph then have a really fair assessment of the competition it is very large and its going to be very tough does not mean that jpmorgan wont win it just means your eyes are open jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and i agree i think banks dont talk enough about client acquisitions and market share so agree with you there just as a followup jamie very quickly there are some questions around like peak inflation peak growth i know you guys are very bullish compare and contrast how the world looks to you today versus back in when we came out of the financial crisis and the risk of gdp growth disappointing over the next few years jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think they are completely different fundamentally coming out of the crisis okay the world was massively overleveraged you had investment banks with times leverage not jpmorgan we did not need ph talk and didnt need help but lehman baird goldman morgan you had banks overseas dexia indiscernible banks i cant remember half of them all went bankrupt you had hedge funds deleveraging you had quant funds deleveraging you had trillion to trillion in mortgage loans ph was that werent going to be recognized actual losses spread around balance sheets and derivatives and stuff like that so the world is in massive deleveraging mode the consumers overleveraged the companies were overleveraged the bridge book on wall street was billion today its i think billion if you look at today today everything we talk about loans being down is the consumer is the pump is primed the consumer their house value is up their stock value is up their incomes are up their savings are up their confidence is up the pandemic is kind of in the rearview mirror hopefully nothing gets worse with it and they are raring to go and you see it in home prices you see it in auto purchases you see it and it would be much higher but for supply constraints right now and businesses equally are in good shape theyre not overleveraged today they do have a lot of charts show that corporate debt is like higher than it was but so is corporate cash and if you look at middle market losses its almost zero almost zero and huge unutilized revolver and stuff like that so the second the economy starts to grow which and i mean were going to see loans go up because of inventory receivables and capital expenditures and stuff like that so it is completely different and youve got fiscal policy on auto pilot theres a lot that hasnt been spent yet theres a lot more thats going to be passed and you have qe so far is indiscernible billion a month and i just think youre going to see a hopefully see a very strong economy we dont know how long obviously if you listen to what i just said theres a little inflationary effect ph in that one and we dont know the future i talk about goldilocks goldilocks to me is im hopeful not predicting goldilocks is that inflation goes up the 10year bond goes up the growth is still quite strong you may have growth in the second half of this year thats stronger than its ever been in the united states of america okay and europe is probably six months behind america and so growth can go into next year and the 10year bond goes to and a lot of growth and short rates ph go to it wont make any difference as long as you have that strong growth in consumer there jobs are plentiful wages are going up these are all good things and so obviously inflation could be worse than people think i think itll be a little bit worse than what the fed thinks i dont think its ph all going to be temporary but that doesnt matter if we have very strong growth jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 yeah there are always risks in any environment but the risks in this one i think are quite different from the ones that we had coming out of the global financial crisis jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator our next question is coming from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead your line is open now steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with just a followup question on card nii jeremy you did strike an optimistic tone on the higher spend trends and the potential for future nii tailwind as payment rates start to normalize just looking at the card revenue rate given there ph are another of inputs in that metric i was hoping you could just help us isolate the potential nii benefit versus the current baseline from a normalization in payment rate so just the payment rate normalizing what would be the incremental stepup in the quarterly nii run rate jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay so theres a lot of pieces in that question steven so first lets talk about the revenue rate so a couple things so in terms of the nii we dont really see a meaningful uptick in card nii happening this year like you might maybe see a tiny bit of it sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter but i think its going to be pretty hard to see so i think you want to be thinking about that as a effect im not going to get into guiding on revenue rate for and i will actually point out that were in the market right now competing aggressively with some great offers and im happy to say actually the client acquisition in card is going great and were seeing great uptake on the offers but that comes with a bit of elevated marketing expense so as i look out to next quarter you might actually see a bit of a dip in the revenue rate just because of the way the accounting works there steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 okay for my followup jeremy i just wanted to ask or at least hone in on one comment you made where you said you could potentially still manage to a capital target i was just trying to better understand how much capital cushion you are looking to manage to under the scb and if the gsib surcharge is not recalibrated where do you think youll have to run on a steadystate basis just because it feels like waiting for godot we havent seen any changes on the recalibration front specifically with the gsib surcharge jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay so basically thats a question about the management buffer and a question about what we would do in a world where gsib doesnt get recalibrated and a world where gsib doesnt get recalibrated is a world where our capital minimums are quite a bit higher starting in we obviously disagree with that we dont think it makes any sense at all given that a big part of the driver of that increase in the amount of capital that we would have and as jamie pointed out earlier both we and the system are really flush with capital and the regulators have been pretty clear that theres enough capital in the system right now and that growth would increase that amount quite a bit for us and for everyone else so thats a big part of the reason why weve been so vocal for so long about the need to recalibrate that and i think we see some of our competitors making those points too as they start to creep up into higher buckets and to be fair the fed has acknowledged that this is a thing that needs to get fixed its just that theyre kind of busy trying to get the basel iii endgame put in place in the us rules which brings particular complexities in light of the columns floor jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just add to this i felt the gsifi calculation is one of the stupidest ive ever seen in my whole life and then we doubled it here so the european banks have a lot of disadvantages in terms of they cant have common regulator they cant expand across europe but one of the advantages they have pretty much half the gsifi and i just dont think that in the long run thats right for america to be doubling and but i could consider basing artificial number and so lets just wait and see what the new rules are and then well answer that question we dont have to sit there and guess whats going to happen jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and i think steve the important point is that in the near term were actually bound by leverage so thats what were focused on right now thats our biggest single thing that wed like to see fixed because that is affecting the management of the balance sheet right now in ways that we think really dont make sense and eventually result in higher costs that will get passed on into the real economy just to touch on your buffer point briefly when all is said and done and the framework is fully settled hopefully were back to being bound by riskbased constraints we have a bit more experience with a couple of years of scb and theres a little bit less rule uncertainty it would be theres an interesting conversation to have about what the right management buffers are for people in a world where we do think its important and weve made these points to destigmatize the use of buffers weve made this point in the context for example of the money market complex too we have all these kind of guidelines and the rules have them as buffers that you are supposedly free to use but thats not the way jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 everyone treats them so buffers become minimums and that adds a brittleness to the system that makes it more procyclical than anyone wants it to be so down the road when things are stable the buffer discussion could become interesting but right now its a somewhat simpler story and its really about slr jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and remember theres one buffer we dont really talk about which is billion of pretax earnings a year okay thats a huge buffer its huge that allows you to change your forwardlooking capital if you buy back stock or dont buy back stock and so we have a lot of leverage and whatever happens were going to figure out a way to do a great job for shareholders steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair point thanks so much for taking my questions jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks steve operator our next question is coming from the line from matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open now matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i want to circle back on costs obviously this year some of it is driven by the strongerthanexpected fees some of it is the inflationary pressures you mentioned some is i think discretionary as youve pointed out in the past accelerating from investment spend but the question is as we exit this year will we look back on costs from and say theyre a little bloated because of all of those factors or is this going to be a good base year to grow off of going forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay so theres a couple of points in there lets talk about bloated i mean youve heard jamie talk about cost before right so we go after everything all the time we go after waste we try very hard to never be bloated and to not waste that is a constant discipline its hard work we look for it everywhere so i would like to say that bloated is not a word we would ever use to describe ourselves and we spend a bunch of time in the bowels of this organization i really dont think that thats true jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 and i dont think anything about what were doing in terms of how money is being spent this year is wasteful and in fact as you know the really big driver of the kind of impact on run rate spend is the investments that were making especially investments in technology and customer experience and in transforming the core efficiency of the company in terms of things like technology modernization and data centers and so on so in terms of projecting forward into i dont want to get into giving expense guidance here and i think that you really have to unpack the cost number between the parts of it that are volume and revenuerelated and the kind of more run rate structural and investment cost as weve talked about before so i think this year is its a little bit tricky to unpick the components from their perspective to project indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and if we can find more good money to spend were going to spend it and i told you guys that theres good expense you have credit card you can spend so much money in marketing the returns are very good were going to spend it if we can open hire great bankers indiscernible were going to spend it we spent billion on these data centers which have a huge benefit for us down the road were going to spend it we do not manage the company so we could tell analysts what the expense number is going to be that is just a bad way to run a company and conversely a lot of revenues suck too revenue is not always good and we all know how much risk we take in these businesses and stuff like that so we spend a lot of time with good revenue and bad revenue and good expense and bad expense and thats whats going to drive the franchise the next or years matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood and then separately as we think about capital allocation kind of longerterm is there a thought to more meaningfully increase the dividend payout i mean as you saw at the beginning of the covid crisis buybacks were suspended after stocks dropped sharply banks couldnt repurchase until they roughly doubled but dividends were maintained and obviously your pretax earnings power that you alluded to is very strong it seems like that soft cap is gone obviously so just thoughts its not going to happen all in maybe one ccar cycle but if we do get a multiyear economic recovery is your thoughts on pushing the dividend higher maybe closer to like a payout jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co probably not i mean i think that firstly we want a dividend which is sustainable through a bad downturn and so we really want to do that and i think this time kind of proves that it was a very minor thing relative to capital retention but we want to invest in our future and invest in growing and stuff like that and if we cant and you dont want to raise the dividend so high that it cripples your ability to do other things jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and the way that flows into capital buffer sort of makes that point clear right so part of the reason that were at instead of is the increase that the board announced its intention to do so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 if i owned of the company there would be no dividend matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us if you take a look at your net interest margin in the quarter obviously it came under pressure and if we assume and i know this is a big assumption but if we assume that rates dont really change from here over the next to months the long end stays anchored where it is at what point does the average yield in your average interestearning assets start to stabilize or maybe go up because the new business that youre putting on equals or exceeds whats running off in terms of interest rates on the products that are coming off the balance sheet jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question gerard so i mean i guess one way to think about your question is whether we basically think that nim has hit the bottom in this quarter and i think weve all learned the lesson that calling bottom is a very dangerous thing and i would also point out and i would direct you to like the last page of our supplement im not going to give you a big speech on markets nii which is my favorite topic and why that is really sort of a distraction that we shouldnt look at maybe well do that next quarter but we do have that disclosure where we split out total nii and markets nii as well as nim and excluding markets and the reason i raise that is that yes your overall mental model is not wrong its reasonable to think that nim might stabilize around these levels but its noisy and the markets number is in there and thats going to add noise and also i would say right now theres an unusual amount of numeratordenominatortype effects so whatever winds up being true about the numerator you also have quite a bit of volatility in the denominator there which is one of the reasons that we obviously dont manage to that number as youve heard us say before but your overall frame sounds reasonable to me gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 very good and then as a followup and i may have misheard you so correct me if im wrong but i think you said that the higher level of noninterest expense the outlook that is was really driven by the improved outlook for noninterest income can you give us any color on that part of it the outlook for noninterest income improvement jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co well some of its in actuals and some of its in the outlook but at a high level the point is simply that if you look at the mix of revenue across this company we have some offsetting dynamics right now weve got nii headwinds from the consumer delevering as we discussed but as you saw in this quarters cib and awm results we have exceptional performance in banking and in wealth management and even though markets is down yearonyear its actually up significantly from what we expect higher gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co expense ph governance so thats kind of how it all comes together gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i appreciate it thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co you want some of the expenses to go up because that means that good revenues are going up jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co indeed operator our next question is coming from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 i had a couple questions one was just on sinking through the outlook for nii like you indicated billion subject to market conditions can you just give us a sense as to how youre thinking about market conditions whats the trigger point for being maybe betterthanexpected versus coming down and i ask in context of i notice your securities book you shifted a bunch from afs to htm so it feels like from that youre waiting more for rates to move up materially before you would lean into that yield curve trade but maybe you can give us a sense as to what that market conditions comment was referring to and how youre thinking about that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so lets go through that a second so i said i wasnt going to give my big markets nii speech until next quarter but i cant resist so you talk about market conditions the markets nii component of that nii outlook includes things like the extent to which we have spec pools versus tba the extent to which we have futures versus cash and highrate countries like brazil the growth in prime brokerage balances the common theme across all of these is there are situations where youre deploying balance sheet in the markets business to serve clients and thats profitable deployment on a spread basis but theres quite a bit of grossup between the kind of nonderivative piece of it and the derivative or derivativelight piece of it where the derivative piece of it doesnt have any nii and the nonderivative piece of it does so every unit of that sort of activity that you do creates a significant swing in the nii number either up or down with very little impact to the bottom line now thats not the entirety of the market story there are parts of the markets business where were actually doing more a indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think he wants the market not the markets jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co no i know but part of the market dependent comment is the market dependent indiscernible markets business ill go to the other point in a second and im almost done with the speech anyway you get the point so thats one point of fluctuation but going to your other piece so the afshtm and i think your implied question which is basically what would make us want to deploy more into a higher rate environment so i will say that the afshtm changes that youve seen are really just primarily about managing capital across the various constraints while preserving the right level of flexibility to do deployment but given the level of cash balances right now the afshtm ph isnt really a main constraint in terms of duration buys and i think we have enough flexibility in there to do kind of shortend cash deployment tactically as we always do so to get to the punch line its kind of what we said before which is were bullish on the economy we believe that that comes with higher inflation and therefore higher rates and in light of that were happy to be patient right now when that actually changes and we decide to deploy more youll see it in future quarters jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and just a simple way to think about it the billion indiscernible markets business which goes up or down if rates go up you can see our earnings and risk disclosure we will earn more nii all things being jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 equal of course they never are but all things equal and in addition to that we can make decisions to deploy more money for more nii betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc its interesting versus when you were at our conference jamie it seems like the billion is more a function of the curve given the fact that card did it looks like better than you had thought at that time in the middle of june based on your comments about spend being up so much but the jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co betsy let me just sorry to interrupt you but let me just pick up on that point for a second because i think someone else asked a similar question but i would just remind you that we do see a very healthy sequential growth in card loans on the back of spending but the key issue is the revolve behavior and so our view on that really hasnt changed and we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers which remains kind of the consistent reason why we have a muted outlook for card nii this year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah yeah no i totally get that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible and i dont want to correct anyone here but i personally think youll see it go up by the end of the year okay i think were being a little conservative on that because with all the spend and stuff like that but we hate guessing what id look at much more is how many cards you have how much spend you have how many happy customers do you have nii will take care of itself betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and on that front your card fees were quite good right you mentioned that in your press release maybe you can give us a sense as to the drivers is that new openings is that basically what it is how sustainable is that because that was a bit of an upside surprise in this result the card fees jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think its just spend betsy i mean we can get you a little more color than that reggie can follow up if you want but at a high level i think the card spend number is really all about i mean sorry the card fee number is really all about the spend trends betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just one last if i can squeeze it in your var came down significantly can you give us a sense as to whats going on there jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean thats just the volatility of last years prior quarter coming out of the time series right if you think about it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right okay thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible operator our next question is coming from the line of ph charles peabody from portales partners please go ahead your line is open now q yeah i wanted to ask that nii question a little bit differently in reiterating your billion guidance you said there was potential for some variation or variability around that number and im trying to understand where the greatest variation could come from is it in your loan growth expectations because im hearing that you really are not expecting much in the way of loan growth or is it in the shape of a yield curve because of the feds qe actions or words around taper and talking about the yield curve could you also talk a little bit about whats more important the short end of the yield curve between fed funds and the twoyear or the long end and in that conversation also talk about the significant amount of liquidity thats about to hit the short end thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co there is a disclosure in the march 10q that shows earning at risk if rates go up basis points us dollar and nonus dollar of billion if the whole curve goes up basis points now the billion some number like ph or is short rates versus long rates the long rate number is cumulative i ph wouldnt add every year every time you roll over theres going to be slightly higher rates that is the number okay obviously loan growth will be loan growth ph thats in the plus or minus but the biggest thing is interest rates q indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible the variables jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co let me give you the variables charles because its kind of a reasonable question so ill spare you my markets nii speech you heard it already but thats obviously a big factor within card we are somewhat optimistic about loan growth but just remember that that loan growth has to translate into revolve to drive nii and so if pay rates remain as i said earlier its a single case forecast that reflects the recent experience so we are forecasting elevated pay rates but of course we could be wrong it could be even more elevated than we are currently forecasting so that would be a downside and the opposite of that if we see the consumer relevering starting a little bit sooner would create upside there and then theres the impact of deployment so were staying patient right now that means that were not burning the steepness of the yield curve and if that changes that could create a little bit of upside and then theres always the tactical actions that we can take in the front end of the curve right now those arent very interesting because ioer is above money market rates which is a big part of the reason that you see rrp having so much uptake but if that were to change and there were opportunities in repo and so on then that could help a little bit as part of our constant tactical deployment there but thats not again our central case q just to followup on that i mean the liquidity thats going to hit in july and august is substantial and thats going to have some impact on the shape of the yield curve at the short end we saw a rise in the overnight repo rate reverse repo rate in june is it possible that we have to have another one to keep rates from falling too far jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think thats a question for kind of shortterm fixed income market strategists in my old research team but right now it seems like the fed is pretty committed to making sure that repo rates dont trade negative thats probably the reason they made the technical correction thats probably the reason rrp is paying what it pays so well see what happens there but to me the frontend of the yield curve from a deployment opportunity perspective looks not very interesting right now and that is kind of our central case for the rest of this year q and did the rise in the rrp rate have any your comments about marketdriven nii did it have any impact on marketdriven nii jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thats not really the way that works jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co youre talking about basis points indiscernible jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean you may be i mean i dont know if this is part of your question or not but theres ph of course the theres an ioer and theres some pretty simple math you can do there about basis points on or basis points on trillion for half a year but those are pretty small numbers in the scheme of the level of precision were dealing with here q okay thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator a followup question is coming from the line from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and jeremy i just wanted to follow up can you give us some color about the residential mortgage lending business how was the gain on sale margins this quarter any outlook on margins or any outlook on volumes i should say but also did you say also that you guys sustained a small loss or a loss in the servicing area if so what drove that thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so lets talk a little bit about mortgage which is a business im still learning but weve had very robust originations billion in this quarter i think the most significant one of the significant things thats going on is weve really finished unwinding all of our credit pullbacks from the crisis so were fully back in the correspondent channel which is obviously helping the volumes theres obviously been a huge refi boom over the last year with lower rates thats starting to slow down a little bit the purchase market has been quite robust although now weve seen so much home price appreciation that maybe affordability starts to be a little bit of a headwind so as we sit here today from a margin perspective you have your kind of typical dynamics as rates go up a little bit refi slows down a little bit the industry has built capacity you have probably a little bit of a margin headwind looking forward and obviously theres a mix effect so as correspondent becomes a much bigger part of the originations you have mixbased margin compression and obviously jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think gain of sale was at alltime highs and now its not even normal its just getting lower than alltime high jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 yeah exactly so its a headwind relative to a super elevated prioryear quarter but its still perfectly healthy in terms of the servicing business i think really as you all understand in the current environment the prepayment rates prepayment speeds have been running significantly above our model forecast and so as we continually update those as part of our risk management that can create some small risk management losses but in general the risk management of the parts of the msr that can be managed has actually been very good and very stable so i think thats everything you had gerard right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes thank you very much jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator no incoming questions in the queue jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co like ill just end i just want to thank jenn piepszak for a great job she did as cfo we also know shes happy in wisconsin in her new job and jeremy i know a lot of
