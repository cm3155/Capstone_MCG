will begin on slide curtis chatman farmer chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning everyone today we reported full year earnings per share of a increase over highlights for the year included driving strong loan growth which pushed total assets to a record level while continuing to serve our relationshiporiented deposit base also with the benefit of higher fee income revenue reached an alltime high this growth along with careful expense control resulted in an efficiency ratio of under in addition credit quality remained solid and we meaningfully reduced excess capital our book value grew while we raised our dividend also our roe increased to above slide provides details on our results average loans increased including strong growth in the first two quarters of the year deposit trends picked up significantly in the second half of the year resulting in relatively stable balances yearoveryear as far as net interest income the benefit from loan growth and the net impact from higher rates was offset by an increase in interestbearing deposits as well as wholesale funding provision increased from a very low level in and reflected continued solid credit quality with basis points of net chargeoffs or only basis points excluding energy we repurchased million shares during the year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 reducing our average share count by and together with an increase in our dividend returned billion to shareholders in summary we achieved record earnings per share and continued to enhance shareholder value turning to slide fourth quarter earnings were million or per share these results demonstrate our ability to drive solid returns with an roe of nearly and an roa of despite declines in interest rates broadbased deposits and noninterest income growth strong credit quality and continued active capital management were positive contributors to our performance compared to the third quarter average loans remained relatively steady as expected mortgage banker continued to benefit from robust refi activity also commercial real estate and environmental services maintained their growth trends this was offset by declines in general middle market as well as national dealer which was partly due to lower inventory levels the tone of recent conversations ive had with customers and colleagues across our markets is optimistic and we continue to see slow steady economic expansion we are focused on employing new customer acquisitions crosssell and retention strategies that we have launched over the past year and we continue to make the customer experience a corporate priority as we seek to raise the expectations ph of what they can be while loans were relatively slow deposit growth was robust increasing billion relative to the third quarter with almost every business line contributing the mix of the growth was favorable with over coming from noninterestbearing deposits in conjunction with this growth we have reduced higher cost broker deposits by nearly million our interestbearing deposit cost declined basis points to basis points in the fourth quarter we are closely monitoring the competition and with recent fed rate cut we have taken action to adjust deposit pricing by carefully managing our deposit rates we are attracting and retaining relationships our strategy is working and its clearly demonstrated by our deposit growth the increase in relationship deposits allowed us to reduce higher cost wholesale funding and helped reduce our loan total funding cost to basis points also our loan to deposit ratio decreased to of note the us treasury recently announced that we will continue to be the exclusive financial intermediary for the direct express government benefits card program for another five years the economics of this program include attractive retail deposits that should continue to grow and our ability to leverage a thirdparty platform for processing and servicing as far as net interest income over of our loans are floating rates and primarily tied to 30day libor which on average declined basis points during the quarter lower rates were the primary driver for our net interest income decline to million resulting in a net interest margin of we added million to swaps in october and an additional billion in early january our strategy is to continue to build our hedging program over time closely monitoring the markets and then taking advantage of opportunities as they arise credit quality remained strong in the fourth quarter with net chargeoffs of only basis points chargeoffs continued to primarily consist of valuation impairments on select energy credits as capital markets for this sector remain soft excluding energy net chargeoffs were only million nonperforming assets declined and were only basis points of total loans and provision decreased to million comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 a million increase in noninterest income helped offset the more challenging rate environment we had strong growth in customer derivative income as well as a gain from the sale of our healthcare savings sic health savings or hsa business along with incremental growth in several other categories expenses increased as expected primarily related to higher compensation outside processing and seasonal occupancy this is in line with the outlook we provided for full year expenses to remain flat excluding restructuring costs we maintained our targeted cet1 target we returned million in capital to shareholders through our dividend which currently provides almost a return and by repurchasing million shares under our share buyback program and now ill turn the call over to jim james j herzog executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide as curt indicated average loans were stable in the fourth quarter with increases in commercial real estate mortgage banker and environmental services offset by decreases in general middle market and national dealer relative to the fourth quarter last year average loans were up billion total commitments as of the quarter end were stable compared to the third quarter with growth in commercial real estate equity fund services us banking and general middle market offset by reductions in energy dealer and technology and life sciences our pipeline remains solid our loan yields were a decrease of basis points from the third quarter this was a result of lower interest rates primarily onemonth libor in addition to a million decline in nonaccrual interest from an elevated third quarter level slide provides details on deposits average balances increased billion with growth across all three of our markets noninterestbearing deposits increased over million while customer interestbearing balances increased billion weve managed our higher cost broker deposits down about million as far as deposit costs with a decline in interest rates we adjusted deposit pay rates throughout the quarter together with a decline in broker deposits we achieved a basis point decrease in our interestbearing deposit costs this is at the highend of the guidance we had previously provided as you can see in slide our mbs portfolio was stable and the yield on the portfolio held steady yields on recent purchases have been around we have had a modest increase in prepays in the back half of the year so this has not had a significant impact on our duration or the unamortized premium which remains relatively small turning to slide net interest income was million and the net interest margin was loans had a negative impact of million or basis points to the margin the major factor was lower interest rates which had a million impact and basis points on the margin also contributing to the decrease for lower balances a decline in nonaccrual interest from elevated levels and to a larger extent other portfolio dynamics including lower loan fees comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 fed deposits added million but had a basis point negative impact to the margin higher balances added million and resulted in a basis point drag on the margin the lower fed rate had an impact of ph million or basis points lower rates improved deposit cost by million or basis points on the margin and reduced wholesale funding cost by million adding basis points to the margin in summary given the nature of our portfolio our loans were priced indiscernible therefore the net impact of lower rates including the full quarter impact of the july and september rate cuts along with octobers was the primary driver of our net interest income in the fourth quarter assuming rates remain steady going forward we believe the bulk of impact from lower rates is behind this credit quality was strong as shown in slide our net chargeoffs were million or basis points excluding energy net chargeoffs were only million total nonperforming assets declined to basis points one of the lowest levels since and criticized loans comprised only of total loans as of quarter end as far as energy while chargeoffs were lower in the fourth quarter than the previous two quarters we continue to see impairment of select energy loans with valuations of a few liquidating energy assets impacted by volatile oil and gas prices as well as weak capital markets energy nonaccrual loans decreased million however we have seen a moderate amount of negative migration as criticized energy loans increased million therefore we increased our reserve for energy which remains at a very healthy level our reserve ratio for total loans held steady at and resulted in a provision of million a decline of million from the third quarter as far as our adoption of cecl as of january our implementation process has been successful and its virtually complete given the relatively short duration of our commercially weighted portfolio and the expectation of a fairly benign economic environment we expect the change in reserve will be a decrease of to and therefore will have little impact on our capital ratios noninterest income increased million as shown on slide customer derivative income increased million including the rate impact on the credit valuation adjustment commercial lending fees increased million with robust syndication activity we also had small increases in several other categories including investment banking brokerage fees and securities trading this was partly offset by a million decrease in card fees as a result of the mix shift in the transaction volumes of government cards as well as two fewer business days in the quarter impacting corporate and merchant card volumes also fiduciary income decreased million mainly due to tax preparation fees received in the third quarter during the quarter we sold our hsa business for a gain of million of note deferred comp asset returns which were offset in noninterest expenses were million the same level as the third quarter turning to expenses on slide salaries and benefits increased million this was a result of higher incentive compensation and commissions tied to performance as well as seasonal healthcare expense in addition outside processing increased million due to a vendor transition fee and seasonality drove a million increase in occupancy expenses as well as several other categories we continue to carefully manage costs as we invest for the future as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of which is well below the third quarter peer average in the fourth quarter we repurchased million or million shares under our share repurchase program as shown on slide together with dividends we returned million to shareholders our goal is to continue to return excess capital back to shareholders and maintain our cet1 ratio at approximately turning to the rate environment on slide assuming interest rates remain at the current levels the net impact from rates is estimated to be million to million on our first quarter net interest income relative to the fourth quarter this includes the full quarter effect of the recent fed cuts combined with the actions weve taken to lower comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 deposit rates of course actual results will vary depending on a variety of factors such as libor movements as far as the remaining three quarters of if rates hold steady we expect to see a relatively smaller residual effect from rates as longerdated assets and liabilities reprice in addition continued hedging activity triggered the modest negative impact we continue to work to gradually moderate our asset sensitivity we added million to our hedging portfolio in october and billion in early january we currently have about billion in interest rate swaps with an average remaining tenor of about three years and are currently in the money overall we remain positive and constructive on the us economy and we plan to make steady progress in building our hedging portfolio over time slide provides our outlook for which assumes a continuation of the current rate and economic environment we expect average loans to grow approximately to in relative to we anticipate continued slow steady economic expansion yielding growth in most business lines this is expected to be partly offset by decline in mortgage banker from elevated levels as refi volumes normalize and a modest reduction in national dealer services driven by a predicted reduction in auto sales as far as the first quarter we expect loan growth for most business lines will be mostly offset by a decline in mortgage banker due to seasonality combined with the slowdown in refi activity we expect average deposit growth of to we believe we will have a normal seasonality through the year including the typical first quarter decline our goal is to continue to attract and retain longterm customer relationships by offering superior products and services along with the appropriate pricing as i discussed in the previous slide the rate impact on net interest income is expected to be mostly absorbed in the first quarter with an additional modest effect for the remainder of the year also the ph full year expense of higher wholesale funding will have an impact in addition we expect a million to million decrease in nonaccrual interest recoveries from the elevated level we saw in loan growth is expected to provide a partial offset we believe our portfolio will continue to perform well resulting in net chargeoffs similar to in the to 25basispoint range given the new cecl accounting standards which became effective january and assuming the current economic backdrop we expect provision should be slightly above net chargeoffs after taking into consideration our loan growth outlook note that this new standard may cause greater volatility in our provision as far as noninterest income we expect growth of about led by card and fiduciary fees our expectation includes declines in certain fee categories that had strong growth in such as customer derivative and warrant income also deferred comp which totaled million in is hard to predict and is not assumed to repeat as far as the first quarter keep in mind that the fourth quarter included a gain on the sale of the hsa business in addition weve a strong derivative income and syndication fees as well as deferred comp of million all of which are dependent on market conditions and therefore may not continue at these levels expenses are expected to increase approximately yearoveryear we expect to see a rise in outside processing tied to fee income growth and increasing technology investments as we execute on revenue and efficiency related projects that are employed in addition we expect inflationary pressures on items such as annual merit staff insurance and marketing as a result of lower discount rate pension expense is increasing about million also recall the first quarter includes elevated salaries and benefits expense due to annual share compensation and associated higher payroll taxes which are expected to be mostly offset by seasonally lower marketing and occupancy expenses our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately and as far as capital we expect to maintain our cet1 target of approximately comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim the outlook weve provided reflects our expectations for continued moderate year of expansion through a cooler global economy and the strong value to dollar remain headwinds for us trade however many sources of uncertainty that are accumulated through such as china mexico and canadian trade agreements have been or might soon be resolved the interest rate environment looks stable for the year ahead and the labor market in the us remains strong and will continue to support the consumer sector we believe this backdrop should benefit us and our customers as the year progresses over our 170year history we have managed through many economic and interest rate cycles with our efficiency ratio in the mid and an roe of nearly we are better positioned to weather changes in the economy or interest rate environment we remain focused on controlling the things we can control to maintain our solid performance our results demonstrate our ability to grow revenue while maintaining favorable credit metrics and well controlled expenses our key strengths provide the foundation to continue to enhance longterm shareholder value specifically our geographic footprint which includes fastergrowing diverse markets combined with our relationship banking strategy is expected to result in growth of loans deposits and fee income we continue to maintain our proven expense discipline as we invest for the future also our conservative consistent approach to banking including credit and capital management has positioned us well now well be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess why dont we start off in terms of the nii outlook i just want to make sure i really understand what youre trying to say here the way i read it is that first quarter is obviously down million to million and then the rate impact is going to be negative on nii so dollars go lower in each subsequent quarter throughout but then you have presumably you have the asset growth offset to that are you trying to say that nii from a dollar basis is going to be lower than first quarter throughout the year or like how do you see the net impact of all the different factors affecting nii after first quarter thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc jim you can james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah thanks for the question we will see progressively lower impact from rate as we go through the year i mentioned the million to million in the first quarter it will be a much smaller amount in the second quarter as of now it might be call it million to million range and then it becomes closer to a negligible number in the third and fourth quarter even though we will see some impact all the way through the year and of course i had mentioned to the extent we have hedges and depending on the rates there that will obviously have an impact also well obviously pick up the volume as the year goes on and you heard me mention the nonaccrual impact that overall will be an impact on compared to ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry i guess because you im sure you guys do very detailed modeling for the year is it right to assume that your nii if you look at say fourth quarter of is that going to be lower or higher than first quarter of james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 you should see volume overtake rate once we get beyond the first quarter to answer your question so most of that rate impact is felt in the first quarter and then you are right volume does start to step up and the rate impact starts to decline so youll start to see a crossover once you get into the second and third quarters ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay all right thats helpful i guess maybe just like a second question in terms of fee income you mentioned i guess in your guidance that that assumes kind of i think its essentially no what is the right word no returns on deferred compensation assets and thats part of the assumptions driving your can you just explain that and is it possible that your fee growth is more than if you do get returns on those assets james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc well obviously deferred comp is a bit of a wildcard it depends on the market and the market returns on deferred comp so it can actually be positive or negative so id be very hesitant to assume theres going to be any kind of return there in fact it could go in the other direction ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay and then just one if i can sneak one last one in in terms of your loan growth obviously to i think last quarter you talked about something around nominal gdp and i guess my interpretation of nominal gdp was closer to can you just comment are you seeing weakness or any kind of deterioration i mean presumably youre seeing some weakness in your expectation for loan growth this quarter versus last quarter and whats driving that thanks peter sefzik a executive vice presidentbusiness bank comerica bank dallas texas hey ken this is peter i think the to that weve communicated we feel good about we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in the fourth quarter and i think we listed the businesses that where weve seen that there have been some sort of interesting timing on what weve had in dealer and mortgage but going into we feel good about our ability to accomplish the to that weve communicated ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc hello john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning good morning and then also on the nii topic so i guess this outlook implies probably that weve got some incremental compression in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter and then could you talk about comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 how the margin should progress beyond that is it fair to assume stable or some incremental compression from there as we move through second third and fourth quarter of thanks james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc okay yeah happy to answer that we have a couple of factors that will be netting against each other we didnt know that we have about bps of compression due to the higher balances as the excess liquidity that you saw in the fourth quarter but even if you net against that the million to million guidance that i offered in the first quarter and progressively smaller amounts after that and so if you do the simple math on that it would imply a modest reduction from the current having said that were always hesitant to provide nim percentage guidance just because it is so impacted by excess liquidity which based on our customer profile is very hard to predict john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it and then on the expense front you indicate in your guidance that your expense outlook is impacted in part by higher outside processing expenses related to revenue and you mentioned in your comments too it seems like maybe fee revenue can you talk about what that is and then separately can you talk about what expense levers you may have incrementally as you look at given the tougher revenue backdrop and any consideration for pulling back even harder on the expense side thanks james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc okay curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc jim will start james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah very specific to the outside processing fees so we actually do have some good core growth in a number of line items in one of those is card income and of course we have associated outside processing fees with that now some of these strong core line item growth areas that we have will be offset by some of the items that i mentioned the very strong year we had in with syndications warrants derivatives and of course the deferred comp item that we talked about earlier but we do expect a strong card year and we will have some outside processing fees associated with that regarding your second question on were to we pullback we are always very focused on expense control i think we have to keep in mind that were starting again from a very strong position with efficiency ratio but we do feel its important to make the proper investments in technology and make sure that were pushing forward in terms of moving the company where it needs to be so we are going to continue to invest in technology and dont anticipate pulling back on that at this point in time comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc hey steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the followup first on johns question on expenses so if you look at the expected increase in is there anything unusual you would call out i mean pension sounded like it was million or do you think thats a good run rate for the company here as you continue to reinvest curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc yeah pension would be the only real unusual item there i would say normal inflation including merits would be the largest item so nothing too unique in terms of what makes up that expense base going forward id be hesitant to call that a run rate what were really focused on is really operating leverage going forward we do have a bit of a transition here with some of the pension expense and some of the strong noninterest income headwinds that we talked about earlier but were really more focused on positive operating leverage and thats where we expect to get in the future steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and i just was looking for color you guys put up really strong growth in deposits in the quarter give more color on why were so strong james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah it was a very strong quarter were very pleased with it we talked about being up billion but keep in mind we ran off about million of brokered cds so the way i look at it is we actually are up about billion or so on deposits so were very pleased there its a very concerted effort to go out and ph deposit gather re priced appropriately where we needed to these are relationships that we poured into the bank none of these were standalone deposits i will say that probably at least half of this is seasonal and its always hard to tell when this money might bleed out during the first quarter but approximately half maybe a little half from what i can tell is seasonal but there is a strong component of it that i think is core and will stick with us through the year even if we see a minor decline in the first quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc and this is curt i might add steven that the relationship component that jim talked about weve made a deliberate strategy not to try chase sort of hot money or transactional deposits that have really leveraged our deposit pricing and programs that we had in place like our cd program around new client acquisition and acquiring additional deposits from existing customers which i think is the right strategy for us longer term and very consistent with our relationshipbased approach steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful maybe just one final one curt your comments recently about comerica potentially being an acquirer got quite a bit of attention im curious are you actively having conversations with ph targets or is this something youre just thinking of really over the longer term thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc yeah steven i think maybe first thing i would say is that if you read the text of anything that has been written on me theres no change in any of our strategy there are few headlines that maybe were i think a little bit misleading and we are very focused on organic growth as we have been for a long time weve done two acquisitions in the last years and what weve said and what ive said and ralph before me is that if theres something that makes sense in texas and california that would be a good strategic fit and ph were in one of the major metropolitan areas and make the right economics for our company and for our shareholders well take a look at it but that land is fairly narrow and so for the day in and day out we continue to focus on organic growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of jennifer demba with suntrust curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning curt question on asset quality it looks like the increase in criticized loans was energy driven just wondering if you guys think chargeoffs will be higher in that sector this year or lower and are you seeing any other underlying weakness in any other sector in your portfolio thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc pete peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah jennifer so were guiding to basis points in chargeoffs and if you take a look at only basis points of exenergy chargeoffs we dont think thats sustainable so we would expect that exenergy we would see slightly higher chargeoffs than what we saw in and were hopeful that that could be offset fully or at least partially by lower energy chargeoffs so that remains to be seen but thats where we get the outlook jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay are you seeing any weakness at all in any other sectors or geographies pete at this point peter w guilfoile a chief credit officer executive vice president comerica inc no were really not four basis points of exenergy chargeoffs in only million in net chargeoff ex energy in the fourth quarter our nonaccrual levels are at very low levels and that includes energy so were seeing a lot of strength particularly in the billion of the portfolio that is exenergy jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay one other question we saw a major transaction announced in texas recently just wondering if you guys are expecting any merger disruption opportunities from that transaction thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc jennifer theres always disruptions that occur in markets when transactions occur but i would say in general theres nothing that strategically changes our focus as an organization and we are in some different segments and some different customer focus and a number of those transactions that have occurred jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning mike operator mike you may be on mute comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you hear me curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc yes we can mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc sorry about that so how much was your technology spending last year how much do you think it will increase and what are the areas of technology spending focused curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc yeah we jim you want to start on that and then ill add in around on the areas of focus james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah mike we dont quote a specific number on technology spending simply because its so difficult and challenging to get in apples and apples work with other banks and define exactly what falls in the technology bucket but i will say we have a as implied in the expense outlook for we do have a modest increase in technology expense in over and beyond the strong spend in so it is something that we continue to invest in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc i might just add to that mike that weve talked before about the gear up initiative having positioned us well from an overall technology spend we did a lot of work in the last several years to rationalize many of our applications improve our aging platforms i think weve been a leader in terms of the cloud migration especially in noncustomer interfacing applications and theres a lot of the work we have done around that has helped free up capacity for us for new projects in the last months that has included a new across the company loan origination and servicing platform a new companywide crm platform major investments in data analytics to help us in the marketing and servicing of our clients major upgrades to our call center technology and then for a number of key areas of focus in items that will be coming online related to upgrades to our atms major upgrades to our baking center infrastructure and technology including enabling all of our employees in the banking center with tablets to make them more mobile in their selling and servicing efforts a pretty major upgrade to our onboarding capabilities on the digital side for our consumer prospecting customers and then fairly significant upgrades to the treasury management platform in the payments area as well as a new portal for our wealth management clients so we continue to be very focused on things that id put in a category of colleague comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 and customer enable it and like most institutions we have a longer term roadmap were working on but we feel like we are wellpositioned relative to our competitors in providing really good experience to our customers mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one followup i assume you would employ many vendors to help you with this transformation what took place with the vendor transition costs i guess you always have a balance getting vendors to help you facilitate the transition on the other hand theres always the risk of vendor lockin and during this quarter you had a vendor transition cost but can you describe the analysis that goes into selecting vendors how you prepare against too much vendor lockin versus the goal of transforming the company faster curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc id like to take the sort of second part of your question and then ill turn to jim for the more specifics around the expense in the quarter we do have a number of key vendor relationships like most institutions given indiscernible organization we are we try to strike the right balance between proprietary capability and leveraging thirdparties where it makes sense those thirdparties go through the exact same oversight process that we do as if we were building something or servicing something in house including robust ph cyber oversight and we believe weve got really good relationships that we can leverage and we try to get to a good point in terms of balance and trying to help concentration issues with any one single vendor so jim you maybe want to talk about the specifics around the quarter james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah i would say that other than size there is actually nothing real unusual about this vendor transition were always evaluating our vendors to do the right thing to both ourselves and the customers its been unusual for us to have a vendor transition this one was a little bit larger but its something that were always evolving on in terms of looking at both quality and cost and capabilities and i would just say that this is a onetime cost that though larger than typical its not unusual we have had vendor transitions really every year and sometimes multiple times within a year so thats i think theres probably not a lot more to that other than the size mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc thank you mike operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning question on the deposit cost side of things you mentioned that you saw the basis point decline in costs and just wondering what happens from here in a stable rates environment how much do you continue to have of just natural resetting in deposit costs versus what else from here would have to be more negotiated with across the customer base as youve talked about in the past thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc jim james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc okay yeah happy to answer that we did reprice deposits throughout the fourth quarter as ive mentioned so even though we saw the basis points decline in the fourth quarter i would expect a continued decline in the first quarter just based off the efforts undertaken thus far the change in the first quarter will be a smaller amount than the bps that we saw in the fourth quarter id probably characterize it based on actions taken to date as being kind of the lower single digits of bps but well see where things play out there the two things that two or three things ph that would cause a further reduction one is we did see some mix shifts in the fourth quarter the actions that we actually took in the fourth quarter probably would imply a little larger ph bp reduction but we did see some of our relationship deposits grow related to some of the higher priced accounts so whether or not some of that mix shifts unwinds remains to be seen but that could be a tailwind then i would say it really depends on the competition and what happens in the competitive landscape ive seen a little bit of follow the leader out there in terms of deposit pricing and i think that in turn for the industry will be driven by loan growth and the demand for funding thats certainly true specific to comerica but i think larger picture it affects the entire industry and were not immune from that so well continue to watch the competitive landscape and do the right thing for our customers and for our balance sheet ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and one more question just on the mix of earning assets with all this good deposit growth that you have a lot of it ended up just sitting in cash and unfortunately 10years still at ph or so so how do you start to think about if this deposit growth continues or hangs around does it just stay in cash or given not much of an optionality versus securities book or do you start to flush it back into the securities book over time james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc well we do expect some of these deposits ph late in q1 as we mentioned the seasonality factor both in q4 and the typical q1 seasonality so how much liquidity an excess liquidity we have remains to be seen to the extent we do have excess liquidity i would say it really depends on the interest rate landscape in general we are happy with the size of our securities portfolio and the curve is flat enough but theres not a lot of percentage in tying up that liquidity at this point in time thats something we will continue to monitor but i would not anticipate growing our securities book in terms of size at this point in time comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right great thanks a lot curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i just wanted to followup to your response to steves earlier question on operating leverage obviously in given the poor comparison to nii thats obviously quite difficult but is the message that as we look out into and theres more flexibility for the expense growth to be less than or at least you have more levers to pull it lower than revenue growth curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc so erika this is curt i would say that when you look at the history of our company especially the last year we definitely have had a pretty good expense discipline you look at the performance metrics they really are the top of our peer group and we expect them to be near the top of our peer group once everybody reports especially the efficiency ratios so we know how to manage expenses weve done a good job of that in our history we remain very focused on expense management there are a few dynamics in play in that jim talked about and we are going to continue to strike the right balance between managing expenses and invest in the things that we need to invest in longer term to help our customers and to serve our customers appropriately and to grow the institution but you should expect for us longer term to remain focused on positive operating leverage and theres always additional levers that we can pull we dont believe strategically that sometimes those are the right things to do and again striking the right balance between investing in technology and things of that nature and ph its for the overall expense growth numbers erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 got it and my second question is you bought back almost billion worth of stock which really helped in a year when the fed cut three times and with the cet1 ratio just basis points above target how should we think about buyback appetite in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc jim james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah for us its a pretty simple target in terms of were simply calibrating what we need to support our loan growth support our dividend and then calibrate that against earnings generation and the goal is simply to come as close to as we can and weve been in that ballpark for the last two quarters and i would anticipate staying plus or minus to that throughout erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc and just as a followup question i think i ask you this every quarter but can you just remind us what is your actual capital binding constraint because im sure a lot of peer or a lot of investors look at the cet1 and its a basis points above the targets of some much larger regional banks but if you could remind us what your actual binding constraint is on capital james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah theres a couple ways of looking at that if you look at it from a pure stress testing standpoint the binding constraint would be tier we obviously dont have ph referred in our stack there is another way of looking at it and that is were always conscious of our constituents rating agencies regulators customers and from that standpoint the cet1 is a very important ratio too so im not sure i could say there is just one binding constraint it depends on what perspective youre looking at it from erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning michael comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning hey good morning just as we think about the efficiency and the technology expenses been a lot of talk on this call is there any change to kind of the intermediate term profitability roe roa expectation just given the front loading of some of the expenses and the revenue environment thanks james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc no weve enunciated in the past that we expect to be in the low to mid roes we could drop to the more of the low doubledigit im sorry just to clarify the low doubledigit and mid double digit roes and we expect to stay in that range in the foreseeable future interest rates will be a significant impact and driver there so well see where those go but we feel pretty good about the doubledigit roe going forward at this point still michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then just one housekeeping question just when i look at the npas how much of that is actually energy versus nonenergy when i look at the commercial bucket thanks james j herzog a

president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co good morning i had a couple of questions one on the energy book as you gave your guidance for loan growth in obviously you highlighted dealer services and mortgage im curious with the pretty significant decline this quarter in ep and what seems to be still kind of a challenging outlook for that segment what the appetite is for new lending in that space in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc peter peter sefzik a executive vice presidentbusiness bank comerica bank dallas texas yeah gary this is peter so i mean our appetite is that we are still looking for opportunities but i would say that theyre more limited in this environment that were in were not seeing a whole lot of deal flow youre seeing consolidation in this space not a lot of capital coming into it but were continuing to be a very important energy lender in this space weve got really good relationships were going to support our customers and to the extent theres new opportunities that make sense for us were pursuing them gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thanks and then secondly on the hsa business i assume that there were some associated deposits with that line of business if so could you just highlight what the amount was james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 this is jim those deposits were very negligible they wont even indiscernible whatsoever thats a fairly small scale business for us gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i was just wondering i was looking at average loan growth it seemed to have weakened a little bit from the mid quarter update and im just wondering what drove that and what gives you the confidence of the to loan growth in because first quarter is going to start off kind of flattish curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc thanks peter ill let peter peter sefzik a executive vice presidentbusiness bank comerica bank dallas texas yeah i would just remind you again for last year we had yearoveryear loan growth it felt really good it was across kind of most of our businesses in the first part of the year we really saw good loan growth in the middle market and i think as we got into the second half of the year we saw a little bit really in california and michigan where middle market slowed down a little bit but nothing that overly concerned us texas continued to perform really well so as we go into next year we feel like our pipelines in middle market in those markets look really good and we feel good about our specialty businesses again we did see a little bit of ph dial back in dealer at the end of the quarter our ph efs business dialed back a little bit but we still feel really good about those going into and feel like were going to be able to achieve that to that weve communicated peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then on a separate note just one housekeeping the guidance for net interest income in the first quarter of down million to million that does not include one less day count which i think is about million to million is that right comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc that is correct yeah we were simply guiding on the rate impact when we mentioned the million to million so youre absolutely right there will be the one day impact peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it okay thanks very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc thanks peter operator your next question comes from the line of lana chan with bmo capital markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning lana lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states good morning i just have a couple of cleanup questions one on the fee income side the expectations for growth in from the fiduciary side it was kind of flat in whats driving growth expectations in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc yeah fiduciary specifically lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states yeah i think that was one of the drivers of the fee income growth in card and fiduciary curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc yeah yeah i would say a couple of things related to fiduciary one thats a business that weve been in for a long time and a business in which we have scale both in serving our existing clients were in the institutional trust business as well and then we have a third party trust platform where we provide trust services for many of the larger broker dealers in the us and so we see growth opportunities kind of across all of these various buckets fiduciary is also one of those categories that is impacted by the market and so optimistic outlook on the equity and bond markets for the flattish nature to nothing unusual there we did have some repositioning with a number of different customers but over time thats a business that we have grown nicely and we would see sort of normal growth in comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states okay thank you and the second question is can you remind me do you have a target dividend payout ratio james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc we do not our goal with the dividend is simply to make sure that it is sustainable thats really where our focus is and obviously you dont want the dividend payout ratio to get too high if you have a what ill call a normal income stream which indiscernible to be somewhat normal right now so simply sustainable strong and were comfortable where it is right now curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc i guess just to add to that obviously the last four or five years weve had very nice growth in dividend and return to our shareholders so weve been very focused on that and ph youd expect rate of growth in the dividend to start to slow out in the year lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets united states okay thank you appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs curtis chatman farmer a chairman president and chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brock vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys this is vilas abraham for brock just a quick question on cecl if you guys could just give a little bit more color on the day two impact how are you thinking about that and maybe specifically as it relates to the energy portfolio thanks james j herzog a executive vice president interim chief financial officer comerica inc yeah so the day two impact with regard to energy we have to look at a couple of different factors one is not just our the economic forecasts but how the economic forecast would impact energy specifically and so we would expect that there would be modest growth in our reserves for energy just like it would be under the incurred model but we dont expect cecl would impact that to any larger degree than what we see under the incurred model vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thats it for me thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call
