staying safe before addressing our quarter results id first like to discuss the current business environment in puerto rico as outlined in the first two slides of the presentation the pandemic and related economic disruption continues to have a significant impact on the markets we serve particularly in puerto rico the strict lockdown mandated by the governor of puerto rico on march helped curtail the initial spread of the pandemic as a result starting on may many of the restrictions that were in place were gradually loosened and the local economy largely reopened over the past couple of months as economy reopen we had started to see a revival in business activity especially in the month of june however the recent surge in positive cases and hospitalization led the governor on july to announce the rollback of some business and recreational activities and to impose further restrictions on inbound travel while affecting a much smaller portion of economy than the original lockdown these restrictions will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the hotel and restaurant segment the severity of which will depend on the length of these restrictions employment trend deteriorated rapidly in april and are still down significantly compared to last year but they have begun to stabilize the peak in unemployment claims to date in was during the first week of april non farm employment improved by nearly from april to june new auto sales had been severely impacted by the lockdown and were lower in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of however june was the best month of auto sales in the past decades and auto sales were higher than the yearago period additionally cement sales in the second quarter were lower than last years second quarter but up in the month of june yearoveryear our customer spending increased as the economy reopened while debit and credit card sales in the second quarter were down compared to the yearago period they increased sequentially from the first quarter in june alone sales were higher than in june similarly while bppr second quarter mortgage originations were lower than the second quarter of originations for the month of june were on par with results tourism however continues to lag hotel occupancy bottomed in april at however as restrictions were lifted occupancy levels had increased to by midjune driven primarily by internal summer tourism additionally according to the puerto rico tourism company hotel occupancy reached over the three year fourth of july weekend of which were local tourists however we are already seeing this positive trend reversed as a result of the recentlyannounced restrictions according to the operator of the san juan international airport during june arrivals decreased by compared to june and yeartodate through june puerto rico received fewer passengers than during the same period in local and federal governments continue to provide relief and assistance in response to the pandemic the puerto rico government has approved million in fiscal stimulus also it had estimated that puerto rico will receive approximately billion in funds under various federal stimulus programs puerto rico residents are entitled to receive the supplemental federal unemployment benefits of per week so that benefit is currently scheduled to sunset on july popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 as a management team weve taken measures to ensure the soundness of our operation and the safety of our employees and customers most of our branches are open though some are still operating under reduced schedules we are communicating regularly with our employees to keep them informed of the evolving health and business environment we continue to offer alternative work arrangements for a significant portion of our employee base we have established a return to work protocol to ensure a safe transition back to onpremise activity when deemed advisable im also happy to announce that during the quarter we extended healthcare coverage to parttime employees we remain focused on supporting our customers and enhancing their experience at popular we are providing broad payment relief for our consumer and commercial lending clients weve encouraged customers to use alternative digital banking options weve seen a increase in active online users since march and surpassed million monthly active users on our mi banco digital platform in puerto rico a very significant milestone additionally in the second quarter we captured of our deposits to digital channels compared to in the first quarter finally and most impressively given puerto ricos recent demographic trends our customer base continues to grow increasing by since march to nearly million customers following the passage of the cares act popular secured funding approval under the sbas ppp program where more than loans were small and medium sized businesses totaling over billion including billion in puerto rico million in the mainland united states and million in the us virgin islands in fact we originated of all ppp loans originated to date in puerto rico the businesses supported by these loans employed persons and of the loans originated were for less than additionally popular has secured more than in federal home loan bank of new york grants to support local nonprofits and small businesses in puerto rico and the us metro area as we continue to respond to this rapidly changing situation our plans and actions will continue to evolve please turn to slide as in the first quarter our second quarter results reflect the impact of the economic disruption caused by the pandemic our quarterly net income of million was higher than the million reported in the first quarter however it was down from the million reported in the yearago period second quarter results were driven by lower provisions revenues were down in the quarter and were partially offset by lower operating expenses the decrease in net interest income was driven by the cumulative impact of interest rate cuts by the fed partially offset by the issuance of the ppp loans lower deposit costs and the increase in our investment portfolio driven by higher deposit balances credit quality trends remain stable however the full extent of future economic disruption as a result of the pandemic is still uncertain i will now turn the call over to carlos who will discuss the financial results in more detail carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix for the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the first quarter net interest income for the second quarter was million a decrease of million from the first quarter non interest income decreased by million to million in q2 primarily driven by lower deposit service popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 charges by million mainly in puerto rico due to lower transaction volumes and higher deposit balances and lower other service fees by million as lower construction volumes dropped debit and credit card fees by million also contributing to the reduction was the elimination of certain service charges and late fees related to our response to the pandemic these items were partially offset by first an increase in the net unrealized gain on equity securities of million related to employee deferred compensation plan this entry has an offsetting expense in the personnel cost line and second million increase in other operating income mostly due to a million gain from the sale of our corporate office building for the last couple of years noninterest income had a quarterly run rate between million and million a lot of moving parts contributed to the difference of million to million between this run rate on our q2 results but this reduction is consistent with our prior guidance of potential reductions of around million per month the speed at which we could return to more trend like noninterest income levels will depend on the rate of reopening of our markets and increasing client activity levels provision expense for the quarter was ph million which is million lower than q1 lidio will expand it later total operating expenses were million million lower than the prior quarter personnel costs decreased by million driven by lower incentive compensation commissions and bonuses professional fees decreased by million due to lower processing and technology costs resulting from lower transactions we also benefited from lower advisory legal and tax and accounting expenses oreo expenses decreased by million due to discontinued foreclosure activity related to the pandemic last quarter we announced that in response of lower interest rates and the effect of the pandemic we implemented various cost savings initiatives affecting personnelrelated expenses professional fees business promotion and other operating expenses we are on track to achieve this million in savings and thereby reiterate our expectations of average quarterly expenses for to be around million million our effective tax rate for the quarter was for the full year we currently expect our effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide in the second quarter we saw a reduction of million in net interest income the primary driver of this decrease was the impact of lower market rates on the yields of our investment and loan portfolios this was only partially offset by larger balances in both portfolios and lower deposit costs the increase in balances in the investment portfolio was related to billion in deposit growth this increase in deposits was seen across all segments in puerto rico public retail and commercial as many of our customers benefited from federal covid assistance initiatives the increase in the loan portfolio was driven by billion in ppp loans our deposit costs were basis points in the quarter a reduction of basis points primarily due to the impact of lower market rates on puerto rico public deposits nim decreased by basis points to in q2 on a taxable equivalent basis net interest margins was a decrease of basis points this lower nim is mainly related to three factors first the impact on our loan and investment yields of the federal funds rates decreasing basis points in mid march second the significant increase in average deposit which are mostly invested in overnight fed funds and in shortterm us treasury securities and finally the origination of billion in ppp loans this asset although popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 accretive to net interest income with an attractive riskadjusted return are lowyielding and resulted in a compression in net interest margin we expect margin for the rest of to be steady but slightly improving from the second quarter level this outlook is very dependent on asset mix loan demand and the deposit levels as of the end of the second quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion about billion higher than in q1 we expect public deposit balances to come down over the longterm but additional covidrelated federal assistance as well as the impact of cecl and tax collections would probably lead to increased balances in the nearterm the rate of expenditure of these funds and the timing of agreement on the governments debt restructuring will dictate the amount and timetable of any balance reduction our average loan balances grew by million in the quarter this growth was primarily driven by loweryielding ppp loans partially offset by lower levels of higheryielding consumer balances at bppr in the month of june we have seen strong rebound in demand in mortgage auto loans and auto leases while demand and balances in our higheryielding personal loan and credit card portfolios continue to show net repayment and lower demand the level of loan balances for the rest of will depend on the duration of the ppp loans and the performance of the economy as such we are not providing loan balance guidance at this time please turn to slide our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect to well capitalized regulatory requirements as you may recall on january of this year we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for million of common stock which was completed on may popular received million shares at per share our common equity tier ratio in q2 was down from the capital simplification rules effective april 1st of reduced cet1 by basis points tangible book value increased in the quarter by almost per share to this increase was driven by our quarterly net income higher realized gains on investment and a lower share count offset somewhat by dividend payments in this slide we repeat an update the calculation of our pro forma capital ratios applying the loss ratio of our last published dfast severely adverse stress test from in this simulation we still end up with very strong cet1 ratio of these results reflect populars robust capital position for the second quarter of our allowance for credit losses represents of our severely adverse dfast loss estimate our return on average tangible equity was in the second quarter we will continue to pursue our target of doubledigit return on tangible equity while popular is not required to run or publish regulatory stress test for the last few years we have completed our stress test in the summer developed our capital plan during the third quarter and upon approval of our board of directors engage with regulators on capital discussions in the last quarter of the year this process has allowed us to disclose our capital plans for the upcoming year early in the first quarter of that year we now expect that this timetable will be delayed by one quarter as a result we expect to engage in capital discussions with our regulators early next year we then will make capitalrelated announcement in the second quarter of with that i turn the call over to lidio popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc thank you carlos and good morning before discussing the cecl impacts and credit trends for the quarter i would like to take the opportunity to highlight changes in popular credit risk profile since the global financial crisis which you can see on slide number also one might be tempted to view popular based on the last crisis in we are a different company with a stronger balance sheet and more conservative risk profile in the us we shifted from being a lender with significant subprime and construction exposures to a community and niche lender with a lower risk profile in puerto rico we also shifted our commercial mix to segments with lower losses and collateralized consumer loans mortgage and auto we believe popular is wellpositioned to operate successfully during diverse economic environments given our improved risk profile and changes in our portfolio mix turning to slide number we are monitoring the impact of the covid19 crisis on our entire loan portfolio yet certain portfolio segments are more sensitive and are highlighted on this slide within the cre nonretail segment the exposure in puerto rico is mainly comprised of office space while the exposure in the us is mainly comprised of multifamily office space and multifamily occupancy and collections have remained stable throughout the pandemic today there have been limited numbers of downgrades in these segments the level of rate of deferrals mainly relates to customers liquidity strategies in the healthcare facility segment our puerto rico exposure is mainly to hospitals while our us exposure is to skilled nursing facility for both regions federal and local assistance has supported the industry operation today there have been a limited number of deferral requests on downgrades in this portfolio within nonessential retail the shelterinplace orders have curtailed activity of this segment as a result we have experienced a significant number of deferrals and have downgraded most within the ph past rated category of the portfolio based on borrower surveys occupancy have remained stable compared to precovid levels strip malls reported an occupancy and ph collection rate while shopping centers reported an occupancy and collection rate an important part of our shopping centers portfolio in both regions are owned by longterm customers with financially strong principles that can withstand shortterm disruption in cash flow regarding auto retail in puerto rico this activity was subject to the lockdown order and sales decreased significantly upon the authorization to resume sales the segment reported record sales in june with over new units sold popular historically has had low losses in the dealer segment even during prolonged periods of decreased auto sales given the collateralized nature of these loans regarding the construction segment most of our exposure is in the us and principally in the new york metro region the majority of our projects are in the late stage of completion of low loan to costs and nominal exposure to higherend residential to date there have been a limited number of deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio our hotel exposure is mostly in puerto rico at the end of the quarter our total exposure stood at million this segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to travel restriction this segment had started to reopen gradually as part of the governments reopening plan prior to the imposition of the renew restriction on the use of beaches and hotel common areas puerto rico would not resume promotion of the destination until august popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 to date we have had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades mostly within dfast category in this portfolio restaurant balances were million at quarterend this segment has experienced stress driven by the shelterinplace orders through the lockdown orders the majority of our restaurant borrowers particularly quick service or fast food have continued to operate through delivery and carryout as part of the government four phase reopening plans restaurants were allowed to operate first up capacity then then and reselling went back to once the economy fully reopens we expect this segment to rebound at a faster pace especially the quick service restaurants to date we have had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades within dfast category to finalize let me also discuss the segments to which we are not exposed to we do not have material credit exposure to energy airlines or shared national credits turning to slide number we have continued to provide relief to our customer through loan modifications either deferrals forbearance or extensions new requests for both loan modifications have declined from their peak in april we have granted assistance to approximately customer accounts representing billion of loans and of total balance of the accounts modified a significant percentage have continued to make at least one payment while in the forbearance period please turn to slide number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an oreo decrease of million coupled with a nonperforming loan decrease of million the decrease in npls was in puerto rico driven by the mortgage and auto portfolio the auto decrease was driven by the resumption of sales activity at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio was compared to in the previous quarter please turn to slide number to discuss npl inflows compared to the first quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans increased by million driven by increases of million in the puerto rico commercial portfolio and million in the puerto rico mortgage portfolio the increase in puerto rico commercial portfolio was mainly driven by a single relationship which will get more clarity on the behavior of npl inflows in the third quarter now that we have restarted collection activities that have been suspended since march in the us inflows to npls increased by million mainly driven by higher mortgage inflows turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or our annualized basis point of average loans heldinportfolio compared to million or basis point in the previous quarter the corporation allowance for credit losses remained relatively flat from the prior quarter at million the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio was in the second quarter compared to in the prior quarter the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to npls heldin portfolio was compared to in the first quarter the provision for credit losses decreased by million to million mainly driven by the pandemics impact on the macroeconomic scenarios please turn to slide number to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in allowance for credit losses we adopted cecl on january since implementation our allowance for credit losses related to loans has increased by million or driven by the day one adoption impact changes to microeconomic scenarios and loan portfolio changes at the end of the second quarter the allowance for credit losses remained essentially popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 flat when compared to the first quarter of variances were driven by the economic outlook changes to portfolio balances and portfolio credit quality in the first quarter popular opted to use the march moodys analytics s3 scenario which was more severe than the baseline scenario that moody had at the time we felt that the first quarter s3 scenario was more representative of the economic forecast for the second quarter we used moodys baseline scenario as we believe it has now caught up with what most economists are expecting in terms of the impact of the pandemic also the start of economic variables is different from the first quarter s3 scenario the magnitude of commodity exchanges in variable is comparable to the moodys second quarter baseline scenario which we use for our acl calculation the change in macroeconomic scenario caused the acl to decrease by billion million as discussed by carlos and ignacio portfolio balances increased by billion mainly driven by portfolios insured by the us government and thus have no acl impact mainly ppp loans and ph gbma loans subject to repurchase options excluding this loan balances decreased by million driven by consumer loans causing a reduction in the acl of million during the quarter we downgraded approximately million to substandard or worse the downgrades net chargeoff and other changes to acl caused the acl to increase by million to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited stable credit quality metrics during the second quarter however the effects of the pandemic continued to change and the full extent of economic disruption is uncertain the improvements over the last few years in the risk profile of our loan portfolio position popular to successfully operate under challenging environments management will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemicrelated risk changes in economic outlook and how delinquencies and net chargeoff evolves after the period of payment deferral lapses with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates after years in the banking business we know success requires that we act quickly and decisively putting people first i want to express my gratitude to our employees for their commitment to serve our customers and their creativity and ability to adapt to a rapidly changing situation we continue to support the communities we serve through these difficult times by providing payment deferrals to more than customers and also provided assistance to healthcare professionals and nonprofit organizations as they battle the pandemic i would also like to thank our customers for their continued trust and for adapting to this new reality they have accelerated their adoption of digital channels our marketleading digital offering in puerto rico helped us surpass an important milestone more than million active users on a digital banking platform we are aware that there remains much uncertainty as to the future of the economy economic performance will continue to be tied to developments on the health front which are very difficult to predict if the health situation deteriorates leading to a new round of restrictions on businesses this will obviously hamper the economic recovery however the strength of our balance sheet levels of capital and liquidity place us in a strong position to continue to serve our clients and weather the challenges that may lie ahead popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 we are now ready to answer your questions thank you question and answer section operator and thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and todays first question comes from arren cyganovich with citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the decision to change your moodys scenario that you used i know you addressed that somewhat in your prepared marks that it looks like the total economic in the new baseline is a little worse but the recovery happens a lot earlier im just curious as to why not stick with the more of a double dip recession that you previously tapped lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc based on we were down during the first quarter scenarios we feel that moodys was playing catchup they have not adjusted their scenarios rapidly enough to the rapidly changing situation when we sat down for the second quarter as we mentioned our view was different i think they have for the most part catchup and i will categorize the second quarter scenario as being an elongated utype of recovery in which growth happens much later in our growth happen much later in i think as we mentioned in the prepared remarks both i think the scenarios are similar in terms of community impact to the main economic variables also they pass different from one to the other arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and on the deposit growths that you had obviously some boost from the public deposits but in general the large level that has occurred how much of that do you view as somewhat temporary and you wouldnt be able to really deploy that into higher earning assets ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no i think its obviously weve had trouble predicting the public deposits in the past so ive been fascinated to predict how theyre going to be deployed in the future but generally weve seen a lot of liquidity in the system from the federal stimulus payments as opposed to like hurricane relief many of these payments went directly to people so between the and the unemployment benefits theres been a lot of liquidity going through the system the ppp loans put a lot of liquidity into the system its hard for us to predict some of that money obviously will be spent some of it will come back with this and goes off i went obviously when you consume things off island i think its very difficult yet for us to get a good handle on those flows at this time so and the return for taking a risk and going out longer is not very attractive at this time so were trying to get a better feel before we make fundamental changes in our investment approach arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 okay and then lastly the growth in card volume was pretty astounding in june i think you said it was up or ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc was that really just pentup demand because of the lockdown what was driving the really strong growth there ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i mean its hard to pin one thing but obviously there was pentup demand people were locked up in their houses i think we saw some of that in china when in the first coronavirus when people who got out for the first time they started spending also they got money in their pockets i mean again i dont want to underestimate a lot of people in puerto rico they were making minimum wage or close to minimum wage were getting checks of and carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc on unemployment yes they were getting a week but they were getting the checks were delayed as in many states and by the time they got the checks it was retroactive they were really getting checks of something they would never have in their lives so a lot of money in the system this pentup demand and i think consumer demand picked up faster than we actually anticipated people started going back to restaurants to stores so well have to see how this recent surge affects there but i think the consumer came back a lot faster than i would have thought arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thanks operator our next question today comes from alex twerdahl with piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co just wondering maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the downgrades that you guys had during this quarter and the reserve that was associated with them and i guess what im trying to figure out is when you do the downgrades what assumptions were you making about the economy were we already at the point where things just starting to reopen and the expectation was that theyre going to remain opened or is there a slightly more pessimistic view taken especially in some of like the hotels and the restaurants and some of the higher downgraded buckets lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i think as i also mentioned in the prepared remarks most of the downgrades that we compared during the quarter were in the within the past category however having said that there were certain segments in which event information that we had available for us given the prospect of the industry we did downgrade to substandard or worse we mentioned that we downgraded about million million to substandard or worse as we always do we take into account how the company is doing the prospect for the company on a going forward basis they are willing to withstand further disruption caused by the pandemic but we are not making a judgment in terms of the economic outlook we think that things are pretty uncertain but its more based on the current ability of the organization to withstand further crisis and the liquidity position alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for that and then one topic that i think a lot of us in the call have been following and maybe havent gotten that much information on is kind of this idea that pharmaceutical manufacturing which is already a huge part of the economy in puerto rico could grow even further based on some repatriation of medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturing away from other parts of the world on the ground is there more that you can kind of give us in terms of sort of whats going on capacity in the space things like that that or any other bills i know weve seen one kind of circulating any other bills that are being talked about that could be helpful for people trying to figure out how much water ph that thesis can hold ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 well like you said theres a number of bills going on in congress theres a number of people in the administration who have proposed the idea of making puerto rico a source of pharmaceutical strength of the us this is a good opportunity for the island i think that i believe that things have worked in our favor but the impact will be more gradual i think that i think well have a better chance of not losing new production lines and bringing new production lines to puerto rico obviously with the concern about logistics and the continuing warfare with china is going to change the world so the question is how much and theyre obviously going to be shifting production from china and other places closer to the us and i think some will be within the united states i think puerto rico get a shot but most of what ive seen so far is anecdotal except that last week or actually the beginning of this week and not in pharmaceutical because i think you have to keep in mind theres two things theyre going to benefit from this the pharmaceutical and the medical device medical devices are very important people lump them together sometimes its a very important category coopervision which is a very large operation in the southern part of the island announced that its going to make a major expansion so that was announced at the beginning of the week so anecdotally ive seen good things like i really i dont have more concrete information to give you alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co well thats helpful thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thanks alex operator and our next question today comes from joe gladue with alden securities please go ahead joseph gladue q analyst alden securities yes good afternoon carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc hey joe ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good afternoon joseph gladue q analyst alden securities just a couple of quick ones just regarding the ppp loans just wondering what your tests or assumptions are as to when forgiveness starts to come through and when most of that is completed is popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i think our assumption i have is going to be that most of our clients are going to try to get the loan from what weve talked to our clients most are going to go for forgiveness so i think as soon as the sba comes out with clear guidelines how you do that i think its going to happen within the next theyve extended the period you can use the funds to now weeks so i think itll happen by the third quarter end of the year at least i would say end of the year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes its a good indiscernible significant part of the portfolio will be gone by the end of the year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes so its joseph gladue q analyst alden securities i know youve touched on it both in the prepared remarks and in some of the past questions but the liquidity on and deposits on the balance sheet a lot of that is some of the ppp funds and such have you gotten any in the last month or two any insight into you know just is that coming off gradually or do you think thats going to come off more in chunks or yes just any insight you might have so far into what youre seeing as how those funds are being drawn down carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no im not sure there is a lot of clarity joe some of the expenditures by the government will be in big chunks but what ends up happening with a lot of those big chunks is they move from a government account at the bank to individual or corporate accounts at the banks so we do recapture some of that so while there may be a big chunk of funds transferred in assistance for example by the government you may not see the same effect of in dropping in our overall deposits because they just move to other deposit accounts so its hard to get a handle on it the government is taking a long time to actually start disbursing the assistance money so a lot of that money is very new getting to people in the last month or so so its very early days hopefully well have more clarity by the end of third quarter ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes i think a lot on the private deposit is going to depend also on what the new federal stimulus package looks like lot of people have lot of liquidity they have to start using that liquidity and the unemployment benefits run out or go down substantially or theres not a new ppp program or its not extended the businesses that got that liquidity will have to use it and if theres not a replacement for it so i think a lot of its also going to depend on this next stimulus program joseph gladue q analyst alden securities popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 okay all right last question i appreciate the information on the ppp loans that went to some of your sensitive lending segments just ask one additional detail on that do you have a sense of how many what percentage of the deferrals that the borrowers benefited from some of the government programs ppp particular ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no i dont think we do we have that lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc the slide the slide carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no no he wants to know what percentage of our clients in the deferral programs obtained carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc ppp loans ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc ppp loans do we have that lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i dont have that information i dont carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc sorry we didnt ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc and i dont think we have that in hand carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we didnt indiscernible that question popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes joseph gladue q analyst alden securities okay lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc maybe well incorporate the next time into ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc our sensitive segments ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc slide thank you for indiscernible joseph gladue q analyst alden securities all right all right well thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operation and our next question today comes from glen manna with keefe bruyette woods please go ahead glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning how are you glen glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thanks carlos thank you for the detailed information on the nim just if i could followup could you break out the part of the nim move that was attributed to rates the excess liquidity and then the ppp loans this quarter basically the 79basispoint drop in the fte and also with respect to the ppp loans given your prior comments like your anticipation is that a could be forgiven by the end of the year what rate did you use on those loans for the current quarter carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc as far as breaking up the drop its very hard to do glen because you have to make assumptions as far as where the additional funding or the new funding was invested so theres a gazillion assumptions we have to make to answer your question your very good question intelligently from our part we have taken a shot at that and our estimate at this point in time is that roughly big picture twothirds of the drop in nim was a result of change in mix and the increase in the balance sheet and the other third roughly was linked to rates or asset mix or other things so its roughly twothird onethird again depending on your assumptions you can follow with different number but thats the best we could do as far as the ppp the yield that we have on this its million lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc million carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc million lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc million carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc million glen popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just qualitative and maybe this is the big picture across the industry but given the rapidity of the moves from the fed do you think this cycle that nims reach trough levels a little bit sooner than they did in the last cycle and i know you gave your guidance was for stable to maybe slightly up in the back half of the year and some of that could be from ppp loans rolling off but just like longerterm and maybe just qualitatively id like to hear your thoughts on that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes i mean that will really be a very bankspecific situation for example we have been as we saw in the results we have been successful in moving our deposit costs down but we in an environment like the one we have with significant uncertainty we tend to be also cautious in the way that were doing that there may be other banks that are being a lot more aggressive on the way they approach the reduction in deposit cost so thats one consideration the other consideration depending on your deposit book your the lag the effects the lag in the when the dropping rates gets flowed through your deposit book may be different not all our deposit rates went down on march so the full effect of the dropping rates will affect the part of the second quarter not the whole second quarter so hopefully well benefit from a bit more of that in the third quarter so very bankspecific i would assume and thats within by the end of the third quarter most people will have seen a lot of the effects in our case as we know the name varies more because of all the things like asset mix and deposit levels and it does because of rate so in our case there may be the drivers are somewhat different glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then if i may just one one for lidio thank you for the information on the deferrals i noticed in the press release that you said deferrals were going to start to roll off in july through september i guess were a month through july now what are you seeing on redeferral rates from customers and also maybe if you could just highlight some of the differences in deferral policies on the island versus those on the mainland lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i will say a couple of things the first thing you asked i mean i dont have uptodate information to provide you in terms of redeferral rates for some of our customers well provide details to the market on our next webcast in terms of some of the differences i think to a certain extent there are two things that i will say i mean we have gone through crisis in the past and we have offered deferral programs to customers to the whole island before so they are used to having deferral programs and taking advantage of it the other item that i will say particularly related to our commercial portfolio in the us banking industry you have seen a lot of land utilization as part of our customer liquidity strategies in puerto rico we havent really seen that what they have done is they use deferral programs as part of their liquidity strategy so while theyre hitting the line they have used deferrals to just keep cash within their operation popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes i would add that on the this is ignacio i would add that on the consumer front as opposed to most us jurisdictions in puerto rico there were mandated deferrals for consumer products beyond mortgage i know some jurisdictions had mortgage relief in the cares act that was again mortgage relief but basically in puerto rico we had mandated moratoriums and deferrals for all consumer products all that client had to do was basically state that he had been impacted by the pandemic with no further evidence so thats a major substantive difference glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you very much for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator operator instructions todays next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ignacio and carlos how are you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning fine ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc fine carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc how are you gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good a couple of questions clearly you talked about the outlook on the moodys economic forecast which of course influences the provision for loan losses particularly with cecl now if we continue to see a stable outlook for the economy according to moodys and whatever you adjust for your own overlay should the provision for loan losses essentially then be just the provisions you need for maybe some reratings that go on within the portfolio and loan growth and therefore we wont possibly see elevated provisions going forward popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc assuming and that is a big assumption a stable economic forecast i think what you said makes sense yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay now i know thats a big assumption carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes it would be loan growth chargeoffs ph and taken mix and downgrade gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc but the chargeoffs you wouldnt have to replace since youve already say assuming they go according to your internal plan and what chargeoffs carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc only ph regarding the book in standby gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then second question was in the deferral programs that you guys gave us the detail on when you look at the nonessential retail and hotel properties that are in deferral whats the typical loantovalue for those types of properties lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i will say i mean we typically underwrite loans to loantovalue loantovalue guessing value today i dont know i dont so its difficult for me to tell you what are the current loantovalues because i dont know what is the value equation today but typically we underwrite to loantovalue loantovalue gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see and then lastly i dont know if you guys have talked to the new york fed but do you get any sense from the fed when theyre support of the deferral programs where you dont have to reclassify those loans when that support will be eliminated any idea when that may happen ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc they havent they havent communicated i think their communications are basically the industrywide communications that theyve given out i think theyve been the i think theyve been pretty open to and clear that you have to help customers within the reasonable and prudent parameters i dont see any pressure coming from the fed in that area popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see and then just as a followup to that through the end of the year when the accountants have to sign off on sec documents if the deferral program is still in place for all the banks not just you guys and the fed is still supportive is there any potential kind of conflicts with the accountants in the sec versus the regulators on deferral loans jorge j garcía a principal accounting officer svp comptroller popular inc hi good morning this is jorge garcía i mean the regulators and the sec have kind of come together in adding clarity havent suspended any of the accounting rules so were still subject to evaluating the tbrs etcetera and thats really where you would you know thats the risk so where you have to classify this as triple debt restructuring but i dont expect the conflict i think the information thats out there now is just converging and clarifying how to apply it and certainly were complying with that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc and again the deferral programs are not being generally extended to the end of the year they have come to an end obviously the cares act is federally mandated for mortgages and well follow that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc but other than the cares act most broad uniform deferral programs have now expired gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see all right thank you guys carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes the questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks popular inc bpop corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 ignacio alvarez
