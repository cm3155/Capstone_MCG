the call over to curt wholl begin on slide curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call the year is off to a good start in the first quarter we generated earnings of per share a increase over the fourth quarter primarily driven by strong credit quality our roe grew to over and our roa was i am pleased to report that were hearing more optimism among our customers and colleagues across our markets stimulus payments to individuals and enhanced unemployment benefits along with ppp loans to small and mediumsized businesses have provided much needed relief to those that are struggling also the infrastructure bill that is being considered is expected to spread spending over many years this fiscal stimulus and the ramp up in the vaccine distribution in combination with ample liquidity and low borrowing costs have the potential to spur substantial activity the economic metrics are improving quickly and the outlook for the back half of the year is for strong economic growth as the economy continues to reopen and prepandemic conditions return many businesses are beginning to experience accelerating activity i remain very proud of the unwavering commitment of our team to serve our customers communities and each other weve again stepped up our efforts to support those affected by the pandemic last month comerica and the comerica charitable foundation pledged approximately million to support small businesses and communities impacted by covid this support is in addition to the million committed in as you know last year we funded billion in the first round of ppp loans also so far this year due to hard work of colleagues across the bank weve further assisted businesses by funding close to billion in the second round of ppp in addition in the first quarter we processed over million in ppp loan repayments mainly through forgiveness turning to our first quarter financial performance on slide compared to the fourth quarter average loans decreased with seasonally lower home purchase volumes impacting our mortgage banker business also total line utilization across nearly all businesses have remained low however our loan pipeline has continued to grow average deposits increased over billion to another alltime high as customers received additional stimulus payments net interest income was impacted by million in lease residual adjustments in an expiring legacy portfolio excluding this impact pretax preprovision net revenue increased despite the shorter quarter and the decline in loan volume this increase in ppnr was due to continued robust feegenerating activity and our expense discipline as far as credit our conservative culture diverse portfolio as well as deep expertise has served us well strong credit performance and an improvement in our economic forecast resulted in a negative provision of million the credit reserve remains healthy at net chargeoffs were only basis points through the cycles our net chargeoffs have typically been at or below our peer group average including during the past year as we navigated the pandemic comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 with more confidence in the economic recovery and an estimated cet1 ratio of we plan to restart share repurchases in the second quarter we expect to make significant strides towards our target giving careful consideration to earnings generation as well as capital needs to fund future loan growth our ongoing goal is to provide an attractive return to our shareholders which includes a dividend that currently has a yield of about and now well turn the call over to jim james j herzog executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide average loans decreased approximately million as curt mentioned the biggest driver was mortgage banker which declined from its record high in the fourth quarter due to lower purchase volumes energy decreased as higher oil prices are resulting in improved cash flow and capital markets activity we had expected national dealer loans would begin to rebound in the first quarter however supply chain issues most notably with computer chips have stymied production in addition march auto sales were the second highest of all time for that month further depleting inventory dealer loans were billion below the first quarter of we remain confident floor plan balances will eventually rebuild to historical levels equity funds services was a bright spot increasing over million with strong fund formation total periodend loans reflect the decreases of million in dealer and million in mortgage banker line utilization for the total portfolio declined to we feel good about the pipeline which now sits above prepandemic levels it increased in nearly every business line and loans in the last stage of the pipeline nearly doubled over the fourth quarter ultimately we would expect this to translate into loan growth as far as loan yields there were million in lease residual value adjustments mostly on aircraft in an expiring legacy portfolio weve not done business in this segment for many years and no further adjustments are expected excluding the basis point impact from the residual adjustment loan yields increased basis points with the benefit of accelerated fees from ppp forgiveness continued pricing actions particularly adding rate floors when possible as loans renew offset the decline in libor average deposits increased or billion to a new record as shown on slide consumer deposits increased nearly billion primarily due to seasonality and the additional stimulus received in january customers continue to conserve and maintain excess cash balances with strong deposit growth our loantodeposit ratio decreased to the average cost of interestbearing deposits reached an alltime low of basis points a decrease of basis points from the fourth quarter and our total funding costs fell to only basis points slide provides details on our securities portfolio periodend balances are up modestly as we recently began to gradually deploy some of our excess liquidity by opportunistically increasing the size of the portfolio lower rates on the replacement of about billion in payments received during the quarter resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to yields on repayments averaged approximately basis points while recent reinvestments have been in the low we expect to mostly offset the yield pressure on mbs in the nearterm with a modestly larger portfolio however maturing treasuries will likely be a slight headwind in the back half of the year depending on the mix of mbs and treasuries we would likely replace them with as well as market conditions turning to slide excluding the impact of the lease residual adjustment and two fewer days in the quarter net interest income was roughly stable and the net interest margin would have increased basis points as far as the details interest income on loans decreased million and reduced the net interest margin by basis points comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 this was primarily due to the million of lease residual adjustments which had a basis point impact on the margin as well as two fewer days in the quarter which had a million impact lower loan balances had a million impact and were partially offset by a million increase in fees related to ppp loans other portfolio dynamics had a million unfavorable impact and included lower libor partially offset by pricing actions lower securities yields as i outlined in the previous slide had a million or basis point negative impact continued prudent management of deposit pricing added million and basis point to the margin and a reduction in wholesale funding added million and basis point average balances of the fed were relatively steady and remained extraordinarily high at billion this continues to weigh heavily on the margin with a gross impact of approximately basis points credit quality was strong and metrics are moving in the right direction as shown on slide net chargeoffs were only million or basis points nonperforming assets decreased million and at basis points of total loans they are about only half of our 20year average inflows to nonaccrual were also very low criticized loans declined million and comprised of the total portfolio positive migration in the portfolio combined with growing confidence and improving economic forecast resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses of note both the social distancing related segments as well as the energy portfolio have performed better than expected however we continue to apply a more severe economic forecast to these areas our total reserve ratio was very healthy at or excluding ppp loans and remains well above prepandemic levels noninterest income increased million as outlined on slide sustaining the positive trend weve seen for the past year derivative income increased million as volumes remained robust particularly for energy hedges combined with a million benefit from a change in the credit valuation adjustment note that we have made a change in reporting we have combined foreign exchange and customer derivative income which was previously included in other noninterest income into a combined derivative income line item prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change warrants and investment banking fees moved higher and we had smaller increases in fiduciary and deposit service charges partly offsetting this commercial lending fees decreased million with a seasonal decline in syndication activity deferred comp asset returns were million a million decrease from the fourth quarter and are offset in noninterest expenses note card fees remained elevated they were over higher than a year ago due to government card and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus and changes in customer behavior related to the covid environment all in all another strong quarter for fee income turning to expenses on slide which decreased million or starting with salaries and benefits which were up million due to seasonal factors this increase was driven by annual stock compensation and payroll taxes resetting providing a partial offset was a decrease in deferred comp as well as a reduction due to two fewer days in the quarter and seasonally lower staff insurance costs all other expenses decreased million as discussed last quarter strong investment performance in has resulted in an million reduction in pension costs which is included in other noninterest expense in addition effective january we adopted a change in the accounting method for our pension plan previous quarters have been adjusted specifically fourth quarter pension expense was reduced by million this change also decreased aoci and increased retained earnings at yearend by million which resulted in a 16basis point increase to our cet1 ratio finally we realized seasonal decreases in advertising and occupancy lower operating losses and fdic expense as well as smaller decreases in other categories our strong expense discipline is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 our cet1 ratio increased to an estimated as shown on slide as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders in this regard we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield as far as share repurchases we have a long track record of actively managing our capital and returning excess capital to shareholders with more confidence in the path of the economic recovery we plan to resume share repurchases in the second quarter we expect to make significant strides towards our cet1 target of slide provides our outlook for the second quarter relative to the first quarter in addition we have provided expected trends for the second half of the year relative to the second quarter outlook in the second quarter excluding ppp loans we expect loan volume to be stable we expect growth in several lines of business led by middle market as a result of increasing ma as well as working capital and capex needs however this will be offset by continuing headwinds in mortgage banker national dealer and energy in line with the mba forecast mortgage banker is expected to decline as refi volumes begin to cool with higher rates we expect national dealer to continue to decrease as auto inventory levels are challenged by strong demand combined with supply issues also energy loans are expected to remain on the current declining trend as higher oil prices are driving improved cash flow and capital markets activity as far as ppp loans it is difficult to predict however we believe loan forgiveness will pick up towards the end of the second quarter and the bulk should be repaid by year end excluding ppp loan activity we believe loans should grow across nearly all business lines in the second half of the year this is based on a robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will continue to strengthen we expect average deposits to remain strong with the second quarter benefiting from the latest federal stimulus these record levels are expected to wane in the back half of the year as customers start to put cash to work as far as net interest income the million lease residual adjustment we took in the first quarter will not recur that aside all other factors including ppp are expected to offset each other in the second quarter for example headwinds from lower reinvestment yields on securities should be offset by a modestly larger portfolio as we move into the second half of the year we expect pressure on securities yields and swap maturities to be roughly offset by nonppp loan growth in addition lower ppp loan volume and accelerated fees are expected to be a headwind of course ppp activity is difficult to predict and may result in variability credit quality is expected to remain strong assuming the economy remains on the current path we expect our allowance should move towards prepandemic levels we expect noninterest income in the second quarter to benefit from higher card fees driven by recent stimulus payments as well as increased syndication fees following lower seasonal activity in the first quarter also we expect growth in fiduciary income reflecting annual taxrelated activity and new business generation this growth is expected to be more than offset by a decline in derivatives and warrants income from elevated levels as well as deferred comp which is not assumed to repeat as we progress through the year we believe customerdriven fee categories in general should grow with improving economic conditions however card fees are expected to be a headwind as the benefit from growing merchant and corporate volumes could be more than offset by lower government card activity due to the absence of further individual stimulus payments we expect expenses to be stable in the second quarter salary and benefit expenses are expected to decrease in the second quarter with lower stock comp as well as lower payroll taxes partly offset by annual merit and one additional day offsetting this decrease we expect a rise in outside processing tied to growth in card fees as well as seasonally higher marketing and occupancy expenses as far as the second half of the year by maintaining our focus on expenses we expect to offset higher tax spend in addition we expect increases in certain line items comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 due to seasonality and revenue growth finally as i indicated on the previous slide we plan to restart share repurchases in the second quarter now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim as i mentioned in the beginning of the call were off to a good start and we expect the economy will continue to improve throughout this year we believe firming manufacturing conditions increasing business and consumer confidence as well as pentup demand will support strong economic growth it is hard to believe that just over a year ago we drastically changed the ways in which we work and live weve demonstrated the resilience of our business model as we embraced our core values and rose to the occasion to support our customers communities and each other our success is anchored by our ability to provide our expertise and experience to build and solidify deep enduring relationships particularly during challenging times im extremely proud of the work our team has done to ensure we continue to deliver the same high level of service we are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue base with an emphasis on fee generation and our progress is demonstrated in our results as noninterest income has increased in each of the past four quarters our robust card platform is a great example its helped position us for the recent and likely ongoing changes in customer behavior also our fiduciary business is growing with strong collaboration between wealth management commercial and retail bank divisions in february we increased the breadth and scale of our trust alliance business through the acquisition of a small group with expertise in this area in addition we are committed to maintaining our strong expense discipline our technology investments are enhancing the customer and colleague experience helping to attract and retain customers and improving colleague efficiency finally our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continue to serve us well these key strengths provide the foundation to continue to deliver longterm shareholder value thank you for your time and now well be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi curt thanks good morning in terms of buybacks good to hear that youre starting it sooner rather than later are you able to quantify your buyback expectation in and also when do you expect that you might be able to get back to that ce tier james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc well good morning ken thanks for the question we would not expect to get right back to in the second quarter were going to be monitoring the environment throughout the second quarter and one of the things on our mind is that we are looking at the potential for some pretty good loan growth in the second half of the year if not late in the second quarter and so its important to us to make sure that we have a buffer above just to make sure that we can accommodate our customers and their needs and have the capital to support that growth so we do expect to make significant strides towards that level but we dont want to thread the needle too tightly there we think its important to leave some type of buffer there for potential loan growth that could pop up late in the quarter or in the couple quarters following the second quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it so it sounds like its more of at least a event if youre going to keep the capital to support loan growth at the back half okay and are you go ahead james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc well make that assessment as we move through certainly second quarter we would expect to keep a buffer and as we go through the last two quarters well make that determination as we go through ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then my other question you mentioned that you are investing some of your excess liquidity into securities is your view changing at all and how much of those excess deposits stay on your balance sheet over the longterm james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 we do expect that some of those deposits will start to wane in the second half of the year in the longterm but we do feel pretty good about the liquidity position were not expecting the fed to materially change from its accommodative policy at this point and so we are comfortable taking measured steps to invest some excess liquidity into securities well thats again something were going to monitor throughout the year we want to avoid making any real big moves but we think it is prudent to go ahead and invest some of that excess liquidity and then monitor in future quarters whats going on in the economy with the fed and make that assessment as we move into the latter quarters of the year ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning first question your expectations are on growth in middle market lending i know you said pipelines are higher and i think there were some commentary on ma but could you just run through your confidence behind that statement and any markets or industries that stand out peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc terry its peter we feel pretty good on the outlook particularly in the second half of the year as jim and curt mentioned the second quarter will be interesting to see how it unfolds as the economy start to open up and we feel good about it in just about all of our markets the major markets of michigan texas and california the pipeline looks pretty good activity level looks good what you just still arent seeing is utilization so thats probably the biggest challenge but we do feel good on our outlook as weve mentioned and are encouraged about the optimism that we hear from our customers and their sort of renewed belief that things are turning if you will terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a followup there has been a lot of talk about businesses and individuals moving from california to texas im just curious what are your thoughts here is this a net neutral to comerica or could you see some outside growth on the texas side peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 terry i appreciate the question i think its a positive for us sort of either way weve got great franchise in both markets and if anything it gives us ability to really support our customers because to the extent that theyre moving and we can help them with that process i think that puts us at an advantage so from the conversations weve had with customers its not an uncommon conversation to have that about the move and i think it puts us in a real advantage to be able to support them either way terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning on the idea that dealer floor plan levels will take longer to return to their historical levels can you discuss how much of that you think is transitory and more broadly how are you thinking about the risk just in general of dealers possibly running with less inventory than they had historically peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc bill its peter again our dealer groups are doing really really well in this environment interestingly enough so theyve got the challenges of inventory getting cars but they are performing really well so obviously the balances are lower that we see and we think that will come back i mean there has been a lot of press about this issue matter of fact today theres an article in the journal about it just the supply constraints getting chips getting cars produced and not just chips its lots of other supplies raw materials in general i think are in short supply so all of that said we think its probably more like before dealer starts to see floor plan balances increased we were encouraged i think coming into that that might happen sooner but its clearly not happening the supply constraints are still there but in the meantime were growing our customer base our dealers are performing really well and we continue to stay very committed to supporting that business bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you and as a follow up could you give a bit more color on how youre thinking about the stickiness of the deposit growth that you guys have experienced and then if you could also discuss your front book and back book pricing dynamics and how those look across both your securities and loan portfolios just how do new money yields compare to whats coming off james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 yeah we are expecting a large portion of the excess liquidity to stick around for some time which is why we were comfortable investing some of that into the securities portfolio at the end of the quarter and well certainly consider doing so in upcoming quarters so much of the excess liquidity is going to be dependent upon what the federal reserve does what happens with economic activity so its really hard to say where its going to go but i do think its fair to say that a pretty good portion of that excess liquidity is likely here to stay for some short to mediumterm and we would expect some of it to be put to use in the back half of the year regarding your securities question for the remainder of this year we do expect for the securities to continue to roll off and pay off at rates that are higher than what were putting on the books so we will have some continued kind of reduction in the loan yield as each quarter progresses but as you saw in the chart and on the slides that decrease in yield is getting smaller each quarter as those yields start to converge on each other but we dont expect for that crossover point to occur this year so well continue to monitor that and make the right opportunistic purchases with the right structure but we do think for the remainder of the year we will continue to see yields rolloff that are higher than what were putting on bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you bill peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning thanks in slide you guys talk about goforward considerations for the swap and bond portfolio im just wondering with all of your interest rate sensitivity how are you thinking about potentially adding to that book and laddering in overtime visàvis what youve mentioned and starting to do in the securities book itself thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah thanks ken yeah its interesting that you mentioned hedging as well as the securities book in a sense we are hedging with securities right now and we feel like were in the fortunate position and that we have an alignment of two different objectives in a sense by using securities to hedge we can reduce assets and sensitivity right now moving some earnings into the current period while maintaining some upside still but we think we can comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 do so in a way that efficiently uses the excess liquidity to buy securities that are yielding significantly more than synthetic hedges would right now the hedges would carry about bps of positive carry the securities were buying about bps of positive carry and frankly were a little agnostic as to what line item or geography we achieve both that earnings accretion and the reduction in asset sensitivity so right now we see a lot of percentage in using excess liquidity on securities and as that excess liquidity begins to wane you may see us start to transition to more synthetic approaches ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you and just a followup on the costs side youve been pretty stable some pluses and minuses underneath the with the payments cards and pension and whatnot and youre talking about flattish from here can you just talk about just the puts and takes about incremental expense sorry investment dollars versus your points that you make about the other controls underneath like is flat a good outlook as we even look longerterm than just the next few quarters thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah ken certainly to be clear we do expect to be flat in the second quarter but i did mention that even though we hope to selffund some of our technology expenses we will expect to see the typical seasonal increases modest increases in the second half of the year also we do think the economy is going to be in pretty good shape in the second half of the year and so we want to make sure were in a position to support that so there will be some modest expense increase in the second half of the year as we support that growth certainly as an example as cards starts to take off throughout the year with additional stimulus thats just coming to the system wed expect outside processing to step in or step up and we do want to make sure were there for the customer so there will be some modest expense growth as we move through the latter two quarters of the year beyond that well have to assess as we move through this year as always weve done a pretty good job in expenses theyre always very front of mind and thats something that we have a bit of a maniacal emphasis on in terms of making sure were challenging every we challenge every expense we dont think there are any big wholesale changes that were going to make to our expense structure at this point but we do challenge expenses as we move through the year and we expect to maintain that very modest flat to modest expense growth as we move from yeartoyear ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks for the color curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody good morning i wanted to start its nice to hear that your customers are more optimistic im curious what are you hearing from your commercial customers in terms of what they plan to do with all the deposits theyre sitting on and do we need to see those get materially reduced before loan growth resumes peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc hey steve its peter i think the short answer to that is yes i think that deposits need to come down some before we start to see that utilization i didnt feel as strongly about that maybe a quarter or two ago but it certainly feels like the amount of liquidity in the system is just excessive and sort of restricting the need to borrow money now that said i think that there will be a time where companies are going to be theyre going to want more cushion so theyre going to borrow money but theyre going to maintain deposits so i think theres a nice level that we will get to we hope its as we mentioned in the second half of the year as we maybe see some liquidity kind of move through the system so i think its a little bit to be determined on that but it certainly feels like some utilization of those deposits is going to be needed to really see the borrowing pick up steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then i know its tough to provide a full year outlook this year as there are so many moving parts but in terms of loan growth whats your best guess would full year loan growth looks like im trying to get a better sense of how you guys stack up versus your peers and theres quite a few pluses and minuses on your outlook slide james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah well certainly its jim steven ill take that first part of the question then peter can add on its really been a bit of a roller coaster yeartoyear so its very difficult to look at yeartoyear comparisons each quarter has had its own story and certainly were going to see several billion dollars of ppp loans pay down as we move through this year so i would probably look at it in the context of just the goforward outlook and as you heard me say we do expect them to be stable in the second quarter exppp well certainly be down in total due to ppp loans being prepaid as we move through the second half of the year but as we mentioned we do expect solid loan growth in the second half of the year with the exppp portfolio so hopefully that helps and peter anything youd add on to that peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc i think jim you answered it steve weve got some businesses that move swing pretty big mortgage banker dealer and energy weve talked about those but when you look at the rest of our general businesses i think historically weve grown pretty consistently with those economies and i think being in in the markets that were in gives us a real opportunity to grow with those economies as things come back comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful if i could squeeze one last one in i just want to understand the commentary around spread i know its tough to pinpoint nim right just given all the liquidity were talking about but if we look at the net interest spread of in the quarter is the message youre giving to us today is that you expect the spread to continue to decline through james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc steven im so hesitant to talk about nim because we are so volatile on our deposits i really like to look at it in terms of net interest income since the cash of the fed really has no capitalconsuming characteristics so we do expect net interest income to be somewhat stable exppp we will see a little bit of decrease as we move late into just due to the fact that once you lose several billion dollars of ppp loans that are yielding around thats its unavoidable that thats going to have some negative impact on net interest income and thats very hard to make up so i would say relatively stable exppp and then ppp will put some downward pressure late in the year and hopefully as the economy picks up you start to replace those ppp loans with real traditional loans and customers start investing for the future steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning good morning just wanted to circle back on your rate sensitivity given the expectations here eventually around rate hikes can you review your hedging profile particularly the floors that you have in place or may not have in place just to give us a sense of at the point when rates finally lift on the short end how quickly do you accrue that benefit james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 yeah brock its jim happy to take that question even though we have invested in securities over the last two or three quarters fixedrate securities we do continue to be very asset sensitive thats why one of the reasons were comfortable making those investments in longer duration securities youll see in slide that were actually showing more asset sensitivity than we had traditionally you see the bps linear nonparallel shift in rates would produce million of income thats higher than we would typically see and one of the reasons for that is all of the excess cash that we have on deposit at the fed now as the economy continues to progress expect two things to happen in coordination with each other you would expect to see rates rise which is the genesis of your question but typically that would be accompanied by improving economic conditions which would probably result in either the fed drying up some of that liquidity or customers putting that cash to use so i would expect to see that million sensitivity marker that you see on page start to come down a little bit as we invest in more securities and as excess cash comes down to the fed but having said that there is no doubt that we are going to benefit significantly if rates do go up brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just to put a finer point on that some of your peers are quick to call out caveats that the benefit wouldnt immediately accrue it sounds like this is a different situation here where the benefit is pretty direct drive james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc well the benefit would certainly immediately accrue if rates went up there is and probably more so for comerica than peer banks just given the very significant assetsensitive book we have and the liborbased characteristics we have now we do have significant loan floors in place and theyre giving a significant lift but even with that we maintain quite a bit of asset sensitivity so we would certainly benefit right away brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thanks for the question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks brock operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning the questions largely have been asked but just for kind of modeling purposes in terms of ppp fees yet to be recognized could you update where those stand after the second round and the first quarter forgiveness comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah gary the ppps to be recognized it remains to be seen how much were recognized through typical amortization the longer these loans stay on the books the more were going to see amortized through time obviously the quicker theyre forgiven the more we get accelerated fees likely all onetime currently in terms of fees outstanding we have between the two rounds about million of fees on the book right now in terms of how that might play out were going to recognize a fair amount of that throughout this year its just amortization as part of that that were getting on ppp loans well get obviously some of it next year for those loans that stay on the book but just to give you a feel for how this year might progress and what you might see in terms of earnings impact the accelerated fees if you look at those just in a vacuum we had about million of accelerated fees in q1 and thats compared to million in q4 of so we did have a million increase its very unpredictable as to how this might play out but in some of the guidance that weve offered you in the script we would expect that million of accelerated fees to be somewhat stabled in the second quarter we would expect it to be higher in the third quarter it could be higher it could be double remains to be seen and then we would see it kind of come back to the first and second quarter level in the fourth quarter so those are the types of blips you might see in our net interest income quarter to quarter related to accelerated ppp fees now if you take that and you adjoin it to some gradual rundown of the loans that are on the books right now essentially the billion that are on the books and you assume that runs down at its typical rate you put those together and it gives you a feel for what ppp is going to do to net interest income as we move from quarter to quarter gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co great i appreciate the color just to be clear though i thought in your prepared remarks youve noted that you expected the bulk i think you said of ppp loans to be forgiven by the end of this year so most of those fee should be recognized as revenue this year james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right we would expect to to to be on the book still at yearend that remains to be seen but the vast majority should be gone by the end of the year gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 thanks good morning peter maybe a question for you youve talked about the increasing pipeline can you talk about the magnitude of that change in the pipelines and maybe how different it was than a quarter ago peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah jon sure so a quarter ago we were sort of using back to prepandemic levels i think the language that youre sort of hearing now is that its above prepandemic levels so we feel like the pipeline is about as good as i can really frankly remember of being in this role for the last few years and so its encouraging i would say it has exceeded sort of where we thought we would be at this point now again seeing all that come to fruition we still got a lot of work to do but it certainly feels like we have gone above prepandemic levels versus last quarter i think i was kind of using terminology of being at back to prepandemic levels that gives you an idea of it so jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and then maybe to tie that into the deposit question we keep asking but youre talking about deposits beginning to wane as customers put cash to use and i think all we see from a high level is just the big deposit growth are you seeing evidence maybe early evidence of some clients starting to do that starting to take their cash balances down for business activity or is that just not the case yet peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc jon i would say little evidence circumstantial maybe even so i cant say that were seeing hard evidence of that occurring just yet now again we feel like the activity will lead to that sort of use of cash but i cant say that were seeing a whole lot of hard evidence that that is occurring jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then maybe one melinda on the reserves and talking about eventually heading back to the pre pandemic levels is this is the message here its a glide path to prepandemic levels or is the message that if the economy continues to mend were going to we could get another acute more acute step down in the reserve levels melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc thanks for the question yes i think that obviously given the performance of the portfolio which has been it really exceeded our expectations and is far better than what i think anybody could have expected kind of coming into the pandemic assuming that there is no negative migration which again we dont see anything in the portfolio right now that would lead us to believe that and that the economic forecast remains positive to improving were going to continue to see reserves come down close to that or around that prepandemic level i mean cecl is a very complex accounting exercise so its very difficult to peg a percentage or a number that its going to get to but we feel very very confident that well be moving in the direction of prepandemic levels throughout the remainder of this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 okay and i know i accept and respect what you said on its complicated but prepandemic levels would be if we look at thats a good baseline for prepandemic seems this is like a simple question but thats how the way you think about it melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah our day one cecl was about so that would be a good number to sort of have in mind jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator we have no further questions at this time ill turn the call back over to curt farmer for any closing remarks curtis chatman farmer
