cangemi director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you sal good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast and thank you for joining us today before turning to the financial details i would like to take the opportunity to introduce our new cfo john pinto to everyone on the call as you know john pinto was named cfo at the end of last year succeeding me in that position as i transitioned to the role of president and ceo john and i have worked together for years going back to the time with richmond county bancorp and we have worked very closely since we have both joined new york community in going forward john will be spending more time with the analysts and investment community please join me in wishing him well as i know that he will do a terrific job as the companys new cfo now turning over to the results early this morning we reported diluted earnings per common share of on a gaap basis for the three months ended december up compared to the year ago quarter and up compared to the previous quarter for the full year we reported a per share on a gaap basis up compared to last year these numbers include an income tax benefit of million for the quarter and million for the year related to certain tax provisions of the cares act on a nongaap basis our fourth quarter earnings were per share better than consensus estimates and our full year earnings were per share up compared to new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 we are pleased with the companys financial performance over the course of as everyone knows last year was a challenging year due to the lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the local and national economy our customers and our employees despite these challenges we turned in strong operating results highlighted by doubledigit eps growth continued net interest margin expansion a strong increase of preprovision net revenue and strong growth in origination volumes additionally our asset quality metrics continued to improve as nonperforming assets fell and todate our loan deferral program has proven to be very successful as virtually all our loans eligible to come off deferral have returned to payment status as weve previously disclosed our deferral program is somewhat unique in that it is for an initial sixmonth period as opposed to a threemonth period accordingly the vast majority of our loans on deferral are eligible to come off their initial deferral period during the fourth quarter primarily during the month of october and november as of december total multifamily and cre loans deferred dropped to million or of total outstanding loan balances compared to billion or at june multifamily deferrals were million compared to billion at june while cre deferrals declined to million compared to billion at june office deferrals at the end of the year was zero while retail and mixed use deferrals were each about million most of the remaining deferrals are eligible to come off deferral during the first two months of the year despite all the economic challenges during the fourth quarter our ph segment of the new york city real estate markets the nonluxury rentregulated portion of the multifamily market continues to hold up extraordinarily well our borrowers continue to pay us and rent collections have remained above prepandemic levels moreover the vaccine rollout an additional fiscal stimulus by the new administration should help the local economy and that should support multifamily and cre properties in our region we patiently look forward to the eventual reopening of the five boroughs putting new york city on par with the rest of the state these trends are not only evident in our deferral numbers but are also evident in our overall asset quality metrics nonperforming assets declined million or to million compared to the third quarter representing basis point to total assets the majority of our npas are a taxi medallion related excluding taxi medallion related loans npas would have been million at the end of the year or basis points of total assets another highlight was the net interest margin excluding the impact on prepayment income the net interest margin improved basis points to during the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of last year the margin improvement continues to reflect lower funding costs as the overall cost of funds dropped basis points to during the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year the decline of funding costs was primarily driven by repricing of our cd portfolio the average cost of cds declined basis points to driving our overall cost of deposits down basis points to this was partially offset by basis points yearoveryear decline and average yields to some of this decline is attributable to lower yields on loans and securities given the low mortgage rate environment we also added liquidity during the fourth quarter as you will see by the yearoveryear increase in our cash balances and the quarteroverquarter increase in securities with interest rates at historically low levels over the past year and a flat yield curve environment we intentionally kept these balances low but now we are rebalancing our cash and securities position to more appropriate levels as we prepare for potentially steeper yield curve environment new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 moving onto the other major highlights of the quarter preprovision net revenue ppnr for the fourth quarter increased to million on a yearoveryear basis and it was up compared to the third quarter for the full year ppnr increased to million this was driven by a combination of revenue growth as net interest income rose based on higher margin loan growth and lower funding costs along with flat operating expenses turning now over to the lending side total multifamily loans increased billion or to billion compared to last year during the current fourth quarter multifamily loan growth was impacted by market conditions which favored gse financing as opposed to portfolio lending this resulted in a higher than normal level of loans which we financed away from us however this was offset by higher prepayment income during the quarter which at million was the highest quarterly level of the year our specialty finance portfolio continued to grow over the course of as specialty finance loans and leases increased million or our yearend outstanding specialty finance loans and leases totaled billion while total commitments were billion origination volumes continue to be strong total originations in were billion up compared to the origination volumes as for our loan pipeline our current pipeline going into the first quarter of is billion including billion of multifamily loans of which is new money on the funding side total deposit at year end was billion up million or compared to the previous year throughout as market rates declined we lowered our cd rates and not surprisingly cd balances declined however this decline was largely offset by growth in each of our other deposit categories which carry lower rates including saving accounts increasing billion to billion noninterest bearing accounts up million to billion interest bearing checking and money market accounts growing billion to billion before going into qa id i like to make a few comments since i was named as the new president and ceo of new york community many of you have opined on what this move means for the strategic direction of this company let me frame it for you this way we have a business model with an unprecedented track record of strong asset quality which goes back over years and spans multiple business cycles we will not deviate from that business model that has proven successful over five decades going forward we will take that same level of energy and commitment and apply to the funding sides historically we have funded ourselves as a traditional thrift however with our recent partnership with fiserv and new competitive cash management solution we will be better able to change our funding mix by improving our processes geared towards attracting more core deposit relationships focusing on the liability side of the balance sheet does not mean that there will be less of a focus on our loan book on the lending side we see continued growth within the multifamily business which demonstrated its resilience during the pandemic both from within our current borrower base and from new customers we will also look at both new and complementary lines of businesses as opportunities present themselves similar to what we did with our specialty finance business another opportunity for us lies within our branch network this is a blank canvas for us and it will be another area of extreme focus under my responsibility all of this will be done through a combination of organic growth andor liftouts from other financial institutions or through likeminded ma partners we will consider all opportunities that make sense to shareholders all options are on the table new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 lastly id like to end my formal comments by thanking all of our employees who worked so diligently throughout whether it was remotely or in person our results would not have been achieved without their commitment to the company and to our customers i cannot be more proud of how our entire organization performed last year given all the challenges from the pandemic on that note i would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions we will do our very best to get to all of you within the time remaining if we dont please feel free to call us later today or the week operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session question operator instructions the first questions come from the line of ebrahim poonawala of bank of america securities please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning tom thomas robert a cangemi director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim how are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good so first of all congrats on the ceo appointment and just talk to us about expense outlook i know expense has ticked up higher in the fourth quarter but i heard you talk about some potential for branch savings and i understand that you may not be ready to have all the details on that but just give us a sense of where expenses should trend as we look forward into the next quarter or over the next year if you can talk to thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc okay yes sure ebrahim so i would say that yes we had some movement on the expense in the fourth quarter again driven from my previous commentary the movement from classified assets for us obviously theres a cost of that were very comfortable with managing through this difficult time on the classification side however that does come at a cost so fdic expenses on an accrual basis has elevated significantly over the past call it six months that had a significant contribution to the fourth quarter as well as some taxi medallion related expenses about million on taxi medallion the differential id say off of my guide was driven off fdic costs those costs will continue so id say for the well just give the q1 guide million is my estimate so its pretty much flat for the fourth quarter and typically q1 this quarter high for the bank so id say q1 is around million new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 you can kind of think about annualization somewhere between million john millionish million to million and i think thats a reasonable run rate again im not yet prepared to give that as a full guide for but on a quarterly perspective i think were going to be pretty much close to q4 and obviously that typically is our quarter high in q1 versus previous years when we compare ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and how soon should we expect you to have an update just around branch rationalization and what you want to do like whats a reasonable timeframe when we should expect an update thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so look we look at the branches all the time as part of our business model were very focused on the real estate side we had a handful of branches that we evaluated last year i think it was a total of branches that we put it on the table for potential reshuffling and that continues and were going to go through all our operations obviously the world is changing regarding banking and were going to look at our branch structure and if we see deficiencies in that well move opportunistically so i would say stay tuned dont expect to see a major restructuring on the branches unless we have a major deal to announce but we will from timetotime we do go through our leases that come due we look at the run rate as far as the economics of exiting one and we will be opportunistic depending on the market conditions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just moving to the margin so i think you still have you flagged a fair amount of high cost cds coming up and debt coming up for maturity just tell us in terms of the refi costs for these and just your expectation on the core margin going forward thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so look as everyone knows we had a lot of opportunities in given where we were and where we are today i still believe that were going to see historical lows in our cost of fund in particular on the retail side so i would say with certainty in q1 we will be at our historical low i believe that was around basis points as a historical low well probably break that in q1 and thats going to be an ongoing phenomenon throughout the year assuming rates stay close to zero so i think its fair to say that given the level of excess liquidity put on given the balance sheet and what we expect to redeploy some of that excess cash will probably costs us about basis points in q4 and probably basis points in q1 i can safely guide between to basis points improvement in the first quarter obviously its albeit at a slower pace than the previous year but given the magnitude of the drop of the cd book and the cd portfolio as well as overall cost of deposit should decline i guess is by the third quarter somewhere below basis points it could be to basis points depending how many of these customers go into a much lower liability instrument so i think were going to see margin expansion throughout throughout the year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 well guide up for the quarter basis points to basis points in q1 and i think whats on the table now is what happens with the shape of the yield curve we had some nice gyrations in the fourth quarter if that continues in the back and starts to improve here our customers will probably come to the table and look to accelerate refinancing and well be there to serve a nice spread in this environment in a healthy multifamily market the multifamily market has been extremely healthy despite the pandemic so if you look at all the asset classes people are paying their rents were predominantly a niche player in a rentregulated space and theres refinancing happening on a daily basis so we hope that we see a better yield curve that could also drive the margin higher ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and if i may just squeeze in one more on the multifamily market you mentioned gse competitive got more competitive towards the end of the year just give us the outlook do you see this portfolio multifamily portfolio growing and whats kind of the feedback youre getting from your borrower base in terms of what theyre looking to do thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc well was a very interesting year the gses was very competitive before the pandemic they put us to compete with a very significant level in january february march pandemic hit they disappeared now literally they could be we were in business in q2 and spreads gapped out we were doing some really solid business we had good growth but q1 of was competitive and id say for q2 and q3 they were kind of trying to fill their role of their quota versus tightening up their underwriting standards taking it through the pandemic and social distancing and figuring out remote origination and then by q3 q4 they kind of figured that out in a very strong way and had to fill their coffers and fourth quarter was very noticeable as many customers evaluated the rate environment lot of those commitments are probably done in q3 they close in q4 we did a really strong job on protecting the loan book so weve actually executed with some of our larger customers to protect these great relationships than we competed against the gses however there was some loans that went away given the market conditions the yields were low and the dollars were heavy and again we protect the credit of the portfolio its all about the longterm credit metrics of this bank and clearly looking at some of the deals that were on the table we let them go and you can see the elevation of prepayment activity as we stand today in january it appears that theres less storybook loans going away to the gses as of today they filled their coffers last year and well see what happens as we go forward here but if theres a sloping yield curve and the back end starts to spike up higher typically what happens is customers go back to the portfolio lenders five and seven year money becomes more ph of the product de jure and we tend to be very competitive there so right now it seems like we were setting ourselves up for growth as we go into to high net multifamily loan growth is reasonable i like it to be around i think its achievable however the shape of the yield curve will really depend on the level of activity if theres a spike in the yield curve we think a lot of these customers that are coming due will accelerate refinance and well be ready to lend ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 well thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is come from the line of mark fitzgibbon of piper sandler please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning tom congrats to you and john on your new roles thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thank you mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co first question i had tom just to clarify on that basis point to basis point guide on the nim that you gave i assume that excludes prepayment penalty income thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats correct mark we dont guide prepayment penalty income thats correct mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay okay and then secondly it sounded like from your comments that well see some changes on the liability side of the balance sheet but there were also some new lending niches that youd consider and i guess im curious what those might be thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc but mark theres a level of excitement here culturally weve always been all about the credit and service extremely well but there is an opportunity here ive been saying this for what many years the low lying fruit of the full relationship lending is out there id say complimentary lines of business for example if you have a very new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 wealthy family who is looking for a line of credit and we tend not to service lines of credit thats an easy exercise for us we know the customer we know the opportunity were very comfortable with the history no reason we should not have a line of credit with a strong borrower that relates into more relationship lending more deposit flows now were getting better deposit ph flows historically but we have so much work to do that is my emphasis i believe that our loan book has not yet been fully tapped in respect to relationship lending and the fiserv conversion that we embarked last year was a major core system conversion but more importantly our cash flow management system is right on par with the largest commercial banks so theres no excuses that our system does not compare to a capital one or a local commercial bank that we compete against and so we feel very comfortable there but we may have to tweak a little bit on the service side tweak in the relationship lending side that will happen over time but i think theres tremendous lowlying opportunity that we will aggressively go after so i do hope that our customers are on the line here because we have a commitment we want to bank you full service coming down to the lease the lease amount that comes onto the lease agreements we should be getting as a matter of course the operating accounts and the full relationships so theres going to be a push id say for funding on a daily basis yeah i think my staff is getting sick of hearing it but thats where im at i think this is the opportunity to change the thrift model on the funding side and look at the pure commercial banking opportunity within our customer base as far as new lines of businesses id say its going to be complementary to our customer base we do lend commercial and multifamily for these these families but lines of credit opportunities that arise were going to thank them but more importantly and i say this with clarity we are looking at all unique things in the marketplace and were very comfortable like we did with specialty finance bringing in a team of people from the outside management list out these are things that were looking at today we have no problem bringing on lines of business that were comfortable on managing as the credit risk so we are clearly looking to a diversification over time its not going to be a build out from scratch i can assure you that im not going to make an announcement that were investing in the residential market and were setting up a new residential portfolio were going to partner partnerships will get it done a lot quicker and it will make rational sense mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co great and then i guess is your expense guide of million to million imply much hiring or will that be incremental as you sort of over time go through thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc you know mark yeah id say the big expense will come when we do something strategic so its going to be blended and an accretive opportunity id say were going to reshuffle the deck were looking at lines of business im going through the entire bank right now were going through all aspects of how we learn the processes well do some reshuffling and look maybe service service people fresh relationship people but at the end of the day i think its not going to be a material adjustment to those the guide i gave you i think its going to be more indicative towards revenue generation so i would say that that guide has some reshuffling internally there will be no real restructuring of the employee base were going to we have a huge opportunity on the system side and we had a lot of people that can be utilized in other departments to work with the customer side so were going to try to find catch a balance and hopefully keep the expenses tight in this difficult banking environment but also focus on revenue opportunities within the franchise so i think maybe well get a few hires here and there down the road on the service but ultimately i want to reemphasize theres low lying fruit here that needs to be picked and we will pick it new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning good morning thanks for the question tom maybe you could start with just the the change in the balance sheet in the securities portfolio and the cash position given the build in the quarter how should we think about the progression of that the nonloans going thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc chris im going to defer this ph of course to john john if you dont this question to john go ahead john john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure thanks chris so we did as tom mentioned in his opening statements we did add some cash and started to increase our securities portfolio in the fourth quarter over the last couple of quarters and years that securities portfolio has drifted down pretty significantly to drop below of securities assets so we wanted to take advantage of the rate environment at the time put on some term borrowings at the end of the fourth quarter to enhance our liquidity position and over time put that into securities and partially into loans depending of course on loan growth and we expect to do that in the first quarter and into the first half of the year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then on the strategic side i mean historically acquisitions have been primarily fundingrelated im interested in with the change in the leadership are there opportunities for notable funding to drop under the balance sheet and improve or is it more of an asset availability today thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i would say a combination of both i would tell you that were looking at everything thats available deposit opportunities are real there they exist were going to be very carefully evaluating those opportunities as well new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 as businesses that focus on deposit gathering but theres an interesting amount of unique opportunities out there that have the ability to gather liabilities either these are nonfdic insured institutions or they have a business that has a bank they may own this type of business that is shredding that type of business so clearly looking at everything we have bid on stuff in the past weve lost were not a ph what we call an aggressive buyer of anything but we do look at a lot of stuff and clearly like i indicated the deposit side of the balance sheet here if we refocus the energy i believe we can get two to three multiple turn on the stock if we change our funding mix being so dependent on wholesale finance as a thrift without doing a large transaction for over a decade impacts on multiple i believe as we turn that multiple into more of a core deposit opportunity you can see a two to three multiple turn and get that valuation back so were razor focused there doesnt mean were going to be successful on winning opportunities but we are very much looking at deposit opportunity as well as whole bank ma i mean theres no question that were in an environment that mergers and acquisitions makes a lot of sense the scale is important we believe we have a very unique system upgrade where other banks in our own backyard have not done again theyre going to have to do it in the next two or three years so its very interesting just to join the family and within the systems here we can prosper together over time i think that opportunity exists so were excited about that and i go back to the cash flow management solution thats really exciting because historically that was some of the pet piece weve had where there was criticism on not being able to have the same technology as some of the larger commercial banks well now we have that technology no reason to not have the full deposit relationship so we have a lot of enthusiasm on the systems side our people work very hard this was a threeyear project in the making so if one is thinking about making this conversion its a threeyear project and we did it in the middle of covid we actually closed the conversion in august of even though it was postponed yearafter year to do it right this was a major upgrade for the company so were excited about that and this will help us on consolidation as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then if i could just given the newness of your seat in the internal focus announcing a deal or a strategic transaction youd be comfortable doing that kind of in the first part of the year given everything thats going on thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc im doing this a long time im very comfortable on strategic business combination this is not about ego this is about shareholder value and we will be very shareholder orientated thats my history thats my background ive been doing this for quite for multiple decades alongside with mr ficalora and as you said theres a new leadership here and clearly we put the egos aside this is all about doing the right thing for shareholders christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 sure operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brock i guess we lost brock operator brock is your phone on mute brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc sorry about that that always helps so good morning i wondered if we could go to go to expenses i guess im struggling a little bit with the guide here which is very clear and i just want to understand kind of whats changed versus basically flat expenses or very little growth on the expense side thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc look i think brock theres no question and this is by the way slightly higher than the previous year we had some one timers last year but the change in the run rate is that we have fdic costs associated with banks that are now loans that are now criticized we have a bucket of loans that went through covid went through the cares act and we reevaluate those credits and they go into special mention substandard and we have to apply an fdic assessment against that risk very comfortable by the way managing that risk very comfortable as far as dealing with the loan books however theres a cost to that so id say the elevation of the fdic alone has got to be between million and million minimum and we hope that that starts to stabilize by first second quarter and then from there as these loans get back to filling their leases getting tenants back into these units andor storefronts you start to get them back into a lot out of a watch class asset so i think thats really whats driving yearoveryear at the same time weve always been monitoring our expenses were very efficient as a company and i think were going to see the benefit on an efficiency ratio perspective because the margins stronger better efficiency ratio numbers but clearly going back to ill reiterate back to when we were trying to become a sifi bank our expenses were million run rate we knocked it down to the low were still operating at low and with that investment that we made in systems and in risk management we have tremendous back office function that we built to be a much bigger bank we have not yet grown the bank through acquisition so we were very confident that when the opportunity arises we have the back office and platform to leverage the expense base but the guide is what it is i think its reasonable dont expect to see a major reinvestment because of the system conversions is done money has been put into this system theres opportunities but theyre going to be from time to time maybe some small list outs from here there local banks that we can shake out some deposit gatherers that well probably go after aggressively and i dont think its going to be meaningful enough to change my guide because i reshuffle within the organization new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and could you just revisit the gse dynamic we can see the depending on your i look at indiscernible for example thats steepened pretty materially it did so in q4 whats driving that competitiveness and is some of it the fact that landlords are looking for any way to materially control costs including interest costs given the aftermath of the rent act like is that driving it or is it just the gses are backend big thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc a number of factors right i mean obviously lets start with rate rate is rate if you can get a coupon of sub and take it over io for years its a competitive rate right so if you think about how this process works youre going to size up a deal lets say with q2 end of q2 and closing in q4 so you really need to look at the rate environment throughout the covid scenario right so i go back to what happened in the first quarter of they were competitive and out of the gate we still grew our portfolio q1 of and then q2 we were in business with higher spreads we finetuned our underwriting and we did some great business but the gses i think were distracted first it was covid it was figuring out how to remote originate our guys have the ability to do paperless remote origination that was a major upgrade for the company that was back in the end of we have the newgen system so its all remote so our people are open for business on a daily basis doing great originations but we capitalized on q2 and then rates were generally low in generals in q3 and thats why at the end of q2 into q3 i think a lot of the larger customers looked at the market and said our rates are low theres not a real theres no real purchase and sale activity so lets lock it along and put the money on the shelf with the gses and its a competitive rate and by the way weve competed with some of those great customers to ensure we dont lose that business so weve had some large transactions and we were the fierce competition in q4 because we sized it up in the middle of the year give it anywhere from three to six months to close and my guys are talking to shareholders out fall through the end of the year was flat to down and we squeaked out some growth in q4 so were very pleased but that was a fierce quarter in q4 and the good news today is that when i speak to my lending people on a daily basis it seems that we have not sizable deals going away we have a nice pipeline we have a nice new money pipeline so we should be back in the position of growth and the gse sold a lot of their coffers last year and they had to fill it at the end of the year and they started from fresh again so lets hope that well be competitive but nothing new here weve always competed with the government and if rates start to tick up i think the product ph de jure will be five and seven year money and the spreads are healthy if i can get basis points or to basis points on five seven year money on a risk adjusted basis we can do good business there because the credit losses are de minimis its not zero brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc right okay thanks tom thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 sure operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steven how are you good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good thanks tom i wanted to start tom regarding your vision to improve the funding base of the company it sounds like you might need an ma deal to move the needle with that said you no longer have a premium currency are you still committed to a deal needing to be tangible book value accretive out of the gate thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc look holistically we looked at that as value creation so i would say to you theres going to be twopronged approach were going to work within the franchise as we discussed within our own operations we think theres a tremendous low lying fruit opportunity thats priority number one were open for opportunities i mean to change the diversity of the lending book and try to take on new products that are new to the bank and really try to drive this into a commercial enterprise itll be an ma transaction that does so and depending on market conditions i look at the environment historically is that we like to do transactions with no premium type transactions where tangible book value is preserved but we could be flexible i mean at the end of the day if we could put a highly accretive transaction on the table and the earnback is de minimis we would consider that but i would still say fundamentally taking tangible book value down is not the best idea of creating value so well be open to interesting ideas it depends on the opportunity right it depends on the earnings power of the partner and i dont call them targets i call them partners we dont do targets because at the end of the day we have to bring the people over from the other side to become partners the best transactions are done when you have partners at the table we build we build the table everyone sits around who is our partner and if we have good partnerships you can create real value i think thats the approach nothings changed here other than we had some leadership change and as i said before the reality is that we run this company for our shareholders and we look at the opportunities in the marketplace its a shareholder driven opportunity theres been some large ma transactions where low to no premium deals make a lot of sense especially with the technology build thats going on out there so were very focused on doing the right thing for our shareholders new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then on the deferrals if i look at the billion of deferrals that are now current or paid off were any of those rolled into the of loans i guess around billion that are now io and what types of loans are in that billion bucket of io thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc absolutely so again im going to go back to the point about the gses a lot of these loans that went into io also could go to the gses on a 10year io structure so no question that was the market and when we looked at the loans that came off the cares act and literally they went back to payment side that was fabulous at the same time were acknowledging that you have this unique phenomena ill call it the manhattan phenomena as the cities starts to reopen of all the boroughs manhattan is having the most difficult time on this we call it getting back to somewhat of a normal if you look at queens brooklyn and the bronx in particular theyre doing extremely well for us id say the type of these assets the ones that have more of a concentration of less rent regulation so they happen to have some more market type apartments you have store fronts that are retailoffice that will have more difficulties in manhattan than they would in brooklyn the bronx staten island for sure so the five boroughs id say the area that we see impact is manhattan and id say of that portfolio ill just be specific billion you have approximately billion multifamily and about million of commercial cre and on the office side is about million and the retail is about million and the ltv on the office blended for all of the cre is and if you look at multi its about and when you look at these on a cash flow basis as you apply a debt service coverage ratio on a casual basis its still north of a one for one so they could pay theres a service on and they also can leave their bank and go to the gses if they choose to do so so theres some of those types theres others that have to lease up again and were working through that utilizing the cares act and getting paid on a monthly basis as i said we have of all our loans are out of the nonpace status which is pretty impressive given the pandemic but more importantly i think what im finding here when i dive into the portfolio and we mine the data you look at the fact that the higher percentage of loans that have less rent regulation of the ones that are the io potential right because the ones that have rent regulation theyre paying theyre collecting and theres no issue which is its a resilient market for that niche business and were going to continue being a dominant force for portfolio in that niche steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great and maybe if i could squeeze one more in in your opening comments you said everything was on the table and as we think about banking in the digital age whats your view on preserving this local brand model youve had for years versus maybe consolidating everything under nycb thanks thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i see that youre getting really deep there so okay ill tell you that look at the end of the day given our franchise we have ph branches were in arizona ohio were down in florida down south down in south areas of south florida new york and new jersey we have a very unique brand but we also have a multiple brand concept right so it all depends on the partner it depends on the size of the transaction in the markets so if its a florida transaction well thats easy if its a new york transaction its not going to be new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 more complicated but again it comes down to whats right for shareholders right whats best for the shareholder what makes the logical sense and were going to be very logical and were going to be disciplined however we have multiple brands in multiple markets if you go into if you go to ohio right now we have ohio savings bank that used to be amtrust we rebranded back to ohio down in the south beach florida its amtrust amtrust has very well down there it doesnt mean were wedded to anything the reality is that if we are going to create something thats a regional platform we have to do whats right for shareholders makes the most value creation so were open to all opportunities steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for all the color and congrats tom thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and i will tell you one before you go were not going to make an investment on the rebranding we will do it through a transaction steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of steve moss of b riley securities please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc hi good morning just to start maybe on credit cost here for the quarter wondering how much is driven by the credit downgrades versus perhaps a little bit of an extension in the loan portfolio here thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc youre saying to repeat the credit costs you said steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc yeah the drivers of provision yeah thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so the actual charges we have is all i believe medallion driven as we go in the medallion yeah new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 robert wann a director senior executive vice president chief operating officer new york community bancorp inc yeah primarily medallion driven on the chargeoffs on the provision we booked which was lower than the third quarter and has been the trend each quarter in with lower provisions the macro environment did get a little bit better housing prices got a little bit better but we did have the increases in the classified and criticized assets that tom mentioned so from a qualitative perspective we want to ensure that we cover those potential increases we dont see a huge risk of loss there as john mentioned earlier but from from the cecl perspective we wanted to make sure we were covered thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats right steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc you know its interesting what john had said ill just follow up on that commentary and usually every quarter i kind of isolate the risk that were seeing and few quarters back it was retail then i said lets see well watch the office portfolio but were paying attention very closely to manhattan it is what it is its the last borrower that really is having a difficult time and if you look at where we are on substandard special mention its manhattan right i mean isolate down to a handful of loans all in is about million of multifamily and about million of cre broken out we have literally an split to manhattan so i think that we have a good hands on this historically is that when we do a manhattan transaction it typically is the lowest leverage we have on the portfolio historically as weve had in queens and when you look at the ones that migrate into whats called a classified situation the ltv on the multi is about i believe that number is around and the overall cre portfolio on ltv i believe is about as well so yeah for us thats slightly higher than the something but for obvious reason it needs a little more help and when you apply an io structure to these loans they continue to cash flow out and also one for one for the most part some dont but for the vast majority do and were working through it but no ones knocking on the door and returning the keys they have real embedded value as well as very strong sponsors that are willing to work it out these are not cmbs pools this is a unique way we lend and if theres any risk at all we tend to get a lot more folks into the opportunity where we will have real strength upon the eventual liquidation believe me theres plenty of people whore loving to buy these assets but theyre not for sale they theyre working through a difficult environment and theyre paying interest only and were getting and theyre all on payment status and theyre paying their taxes to the city so its an encouraging outlook for us i kind of ring fencing now to manhattan and were razor focused on it and we believe that as the reopening starts to take place hopefully sooner rather than later this should be hopefully the area that well talk about hopefully by the end of the year thats stabilizing but theres no guarantee that can happen right steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc right and just on those io mods just kind of curious what the interest only period is and if you asked for any additional collateral new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc typically what we do is that the ones that came through the cares act and paid they just continue they go back to pi and ones that need a little bit help they requested that we offered six months so well take another hard look at them which on april and may again the april and may comes around and i think that if the reopening starts to take place a lot of these guys are on the cusp of going to the agency too so we want them to protect our business and like i said before in my opening comments the agency is a fierce competitor so these some of these loans could go there even though they are considered on a cusp of what well call a special mentioned type asset because of the lease up of the ground floor in particular but i think a lot of these loans are in a very good spot where they actually can make these payments and protect the their assets from going to or asset purchases theres a tremendous amount of money out there that would love to buy these assets in the events things go sideways six months from now so right now were working through it steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay thats helpful and if i could squeeze one last question in just on the securities purchases here for the quarter just kind of curious what are the yields what kind of stuff in the yields youre purchasing these days thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc its indiscernible go ahead john why dont you go ahead and expand upon it john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i mean if youre looking at agency type paper which is what we look at youre in the mid ones in the range for good quality structured paper thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and if you think about we have obviously tremendous amount of liquidity we have billion cash in the balance sheet at zero so thats going to be deployed hopefully into our loan book as well as securities so in my margin guide im very conservative on the deployment of that excess cash but we do have excess liquidity we put out some money long as a matter of taking advantage of the structure of the curve we still have a lot of wholesale finances that had to be restructured over time and going forward even in this quarter we have about million at marked at basis point so thats something that we look to probably lock in long and instead of going overnight and then i think the next big slug of money comes in which is about million so we have time on that so were not going to be structure that its too far out of the money and i think whats really interesting in the beginning of is that we have million on a macro hedge against fixed versus the float on the multi family side if rates stay low for longer well just remove it and thats another basis points to basis points on our margin for so were hedged there and as we grind through that will also be upside for the margin depending on interest rates we may keep it on as rates are rising for some reason and were in a strong economy and new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 everything is behind us but my view is that thats probably not going to happen in months and that hedge could be something thats also beneficial to the margin steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc great thank you very much for all the color thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great good morning just in terms of the taxes if given the change of the administration if we do get a tax increase what does that imply for your overall tax rate and have you or can you do anything to kind of minimize that hit versus in terms of tax strategies thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so thats a pretty simple question obviously if the rates go up we pay more taxes if thats possible i think its more of a phenomena and i hope its not a phenomena but they took it to down to and from theres a talk about from a much higher level and that would impact a bank such as ours to a point where is it going to be dollar for dollar i would say that were going to be very proactive on managing our tax structure which we were very focused on but no question that higher taxes means less profitability right john if you want to add any comment to it ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah sure actually i should have been more clear on my question thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc if it goes at all from to thats a increase what is the percentage increase in your effective tax rate thanks new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah it would be just it would be just below the right so it would probably be in the mid it would go up and thats excluding any other tax planning items that we would do thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc right right ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it but just to be clear is there any other tax planning items that you can do and how meaningful would those strategies be john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah we havent played much in this on the federal side in the past i mean you can see that in our rate currently right so thats not something we would normally look at but as weve looked at in the past well do it in the future ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc lets hope we get through where they dont raise tax they do it is what it is and is probably more probable as that happens and then well deal with it ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats what were hearing right now right its that not in the middle of pandemic but it could be in all right thanks for that thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thats right sure operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning dave new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys congrats on new roles thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey tom you had mentioned the nim expansion beyond as well for the rest of this year just wondering if you think that bps to bps for were a good pace per quarter given what youre looking at now and your expectations on rates thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc dave you know me for long time i dont give yearly guidance on the margin so david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just tried thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i know you tried but i will tell you that a lots going to depend on the shape of the yield curve we had some excitement in the fourth quarter with a bumpup in interest rates i think thatll get the attention of many of the customers if it spikes significantly this margin expansion could be outperform to what we expect but meanwhile when we run models or running it conservatively its pretty much a flat curve environment and were showing the q1 up a little bit here i think we probably lost about bps on the excess liquidity if we put it out fast well get it back as you know weve kept our securities portfolio below which is if you look at the median peer group thats probably the lowest in the peer group and it had to have a little bit of a bumpier as we positioned ourselves to go longer out in the funding side and anticipate opportunities as we start to redeploy the balance sheet and i dont think were going to take it significantly from there so lets say it goes from maybe to but the cash position is very high right now wed like to put some of that money to work and thats going to impact the margin hopefully favorably coming off of a zero return on cash david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay and then maybe just on the loan side where are you seeing new money yields now on multifamily and new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so the pipeline yield i believe whats that john about new money pipeline john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new money pipeline thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc bear with me john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right there thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah again low competing tight on low durations is somewhat shorter but weve been hovering around you apply that to the spread its a little bit tighter than we had liked but i think its coming off of the agencies desire to be more prolific on the lending side that again the spread has been healthy between to depending on the size of the order that we look at and i think were getting that net and thats important but the payoff was high the last quarterly payoff was a and originated were still holding the interesting modeling question wed have what happens in if the yield curve steepens does that go back to if we see a nice spike in the back end so that could happen theres no guarantee were modeling more of a conservative scenario and were still seeing margin expansion david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay how much do you think you need the long end to move up before the gse competitiveness does start to decline thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think when you i really would spend time looking at the 10year move with the 10year the spreads between and start to move significantly here i think customers will realize that economically it may make sense just to go to the portfolio lenders and were evaluating opportunities as far as synthetically getting them to stay with the bank and swap opportunities we do not have a specific swap program internally something that we are considering as a preventative edge to keep some customers from going to the gses to synthetically do that and get some fees up front thats something thats on the table but no question that spread between i think brock had said it between and where you spend time evaluating that has been a nice move in the fourth quarter if that continues given the expectation of substantial deficit spending and theres a view that rates are going higher in the back end that will move customers back to the five and sevenyear portfolio lenders space new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay where were you guys adding borrowings for the quarter and then where you what do you think for rate now thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc id say its to years anywhere from million to million that spread david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc right thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so its cheap overall funding and if we cant bring it on the funding side we will look to rebalance interest rate risk by taking on an opportunity which is threeyear money around basis points which is pretty cheap david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay and just switching to expenses that extra million to million in additional fdic expense this year that you mentioned that should be dropping out of the run rate in right just hoping that you indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc it all depends on how bad the pandemic extend itself and does new york city reopens and does foot traffic start and people go back to work and youll see some pentup demand to release i think thats the key and i think that were being at an abundance of caution moving assets into a classified bucket as we should be doing and then the biggest consequence today on that is that it costs us money on the on the fdic insurance david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah that makes sense and then on the loan growth outlook i appreciate your thoughts there on the multifamily side i think its a to there what are your thoughts on the rest of the portfolio thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc no i think we had a substantial reduction last year on cre just a matter of the market that may be stabilizing a little bit assuming that we look at other areas on cre side but as i say cre is flat to down or i think were going to see a nice uptake on specialty finance given the amount thats outstanding and whats committed this is close to billion committed and billion outstanding is it billion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc billion thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc billion outstanding it is a nice spread there of takedowns we havent seen the takedowns in q4 we hope to see more takedowns as we go into the year so theyve had their cagrs have been off the charts since we built that business last year with a cagr so i expect nice growth probably what hopefully is consistent to the previous year that was probably one of our worst years with the pandemic we grew so you want to take a conservative look at that to there and then you think about multifamily if there is a change in the yield curve we are going to retain a lot more business and i think our guys have done an amazing job on retaining the business with data mining the portfolio were working with the brokers were ensuring that we have a good fair shot at these customers before they leave to go to the agency and well be competitive we have to do a little bit more io absolutely thats the market but were going to be selective there we try to be viewed as a hybrid io lender were not big on longterm io but time to time we make those decisions depending on the customer relationship and its a positive relationship we did a very large relationship in q4 that was io because of a substantial depositary relationship one of our very strong customers was pricing us against the agency and we competed and we lose a little bit on the risk weighting side because it becomes a different risk weighting category however its a great loan great relationship and tons of deposits with it so we have to be a fierce competitor in this environment david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then assuming that you guys continue to grow deposits are you thinking that the securities growth should continue as well thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i guess i said on the security side and john may want to expand on it go ahead john john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah we would expect it would grow but not dramatically from here given what the cash position is and the securities we expect maybe a little bit of growth in the first quarter and then hopefully keep it pretty flat from there depending on deposit growth david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and maybe just one last one thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 dave on the deposit side its not going to be a traditional retail push its going to be the business push which is close to zero david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc cost of deposit thats the difference yeah david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah no that sounds good and then maybe just one last one on fees you had a good stepup there in the fourth quarter whats your outlook for fee growth in the first half or maybe just for john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah were assuming right now its pretty flat to the fourth quarter were not assuming a big increase to fees the third had a lot more of the fees wave during the pandemic than the fourth but were being conservative what were forecasting there we dont expect a big increase itll probably be right around that fourth quarter number thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so dave that goes back to the point of the blank canvas we dont have a lot of fee income john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc so eventually if you start bringing product thats where the opportunity arise we have a very large branch structure where we dont sell a lot of products to the branches so when you think about ma and business partnerships thats where a tremendous opportunity its that blank canvas that we can paint with new products going through the system these are legacy branches going back in some cases to the that we really have a lot of goodwill within the community that could have these lines of businesses that are normal commercial bank lines of businesses that we dont have david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah sounds good all right thanks guys congrats again thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning how are you tom with this focus on the target growth what do you think youre going to generate in terms of deposit growth this year and where do you think the loantodeposit ratio could go to thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i dont know im going to go there its just going to be a passionate push to look at processes a passionate push to look at the low lying fruit and were going to update you guys on a quarterly basis because it really is not going to be a public plan its going to be an emphasis towards culture right and culture here has been uniquely different when it come to the lending side versus the deposit side i want to reiterate the concept that we have so much low lying opportunity for these relationships that needs to be nurtured in mind and obviously showing the technology that we had and we should win more business with the existing customer base at the same time as we bring in new business we did billion originations last year we should be able to get on every single loan a deposit relationship as well as a potential full service deposit relationship if we get of it we won so im a guy about i like but if we get there we win so we do a lot of volume pete as you know and the portfolio is relatively short what we found when we evaluated the book theres a lot of customers that stay with us that are within other portfolios because its difficult to move all your accounts and if you have a good relationship with a good relationship manager they tend to its not as portable if you can win over that business so i think we think about the volume we do thinking about the duration of the portfolio truly opportunistic here and its more cultural and the culture has been clear this is the liability term comes out of my mouth at least seven eight times a day peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc yeah thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and thats where we are so im not going to give you numbers that are a fantasy im going to give you numbers that are reality and youll see the growth over time and if we dont do that well fine tune it until we get there were going to get it right peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thats fair and then if i could just ask on the ma front the thoughts on maybe a bolton fee income acquisition to add some diversification and take market share that way new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah like i said were looking at all opportunities i mean obviously we will do accretive transactions we dont want to do a transaction thats going to take down the earnings profile of the company but wed like to change the funding mix wed like to change the augment the fee income opportunity wed like to start driving products to the branches and we also like to look at the big picture that if we do this with a solid partnership that has all these array of products then we can accelerate that something can happen in five to seven years we can do it overnight so like i said on my opening comments all options are on the table were very shareholder focused we have a very unique franchise we have a diverse franchise when it comes to geographic and we can do a lot of things with it so were excited about opportunities were seeing a lot of great opportunities both on the deposit side as well as on strategic ma peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it all right congrats to tom and john for the promotions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc thank you peter john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steven duong with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys good morning just on the funding side here recognizing that you are now focused on growing core deposits in the meantime as your cds and borrowings roll off is there a preference between one or the other thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc a combination of both for sure i mean we have billion rolling off in months at basis points this quarter we have billion at markets between and basis points in the retail platform some of the customers are not going to go into the cd instrument they may just hide in the money market account at basis points or to basis points so we rather have them go to the lowest cost of funds and assuming that were new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 not in a rising rate environment on the short end theyll hide there for a while and they may be opportunistic if they want to take an month cd or a year cd but the costs versus the wholesale market is pretty much on top of each other so eitheror we rather bring in obviously customer accounts for sure but if you saw this transition of the deposit base that where cds went into money market and other hybrid funds that are viewed more as an operating type account to lower cost right steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah and how much in borrowings is rolling off this quarter thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc we have million rolling off at a coupon and then next quarter i believe we have basis points very small in q3 about million in the fourth quarter of the year its a decent sized amount of million at but on average for the year its about billion at steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it got it appreciate that thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just your strategy on the core deposit growth in the longterm i guess how are you thinking about doing that with the brokers on the origination side thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc weve already had conversations im not going to were not going to announce the secret sauce of that but we have great relationship with our brokers and historically it was about process and that were going to change the process internally its a matter of getting ahead of the closing we close a lot of volume our loan box require we require the operating accounts and loan docs so you waive a lot less than you do and you get them to the table and you get the relationship guys in front of the customers at the closing table when they want this million to million they have to open up the account and get the relationship going instead of waving it so its about repositioning and dealing with process and people and thats the goal here and that fine tuning alone will probably move the needle at the same time we need to get this technology build out that weve invested in out to the customers to see what we have and thats indeed helpful new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc and was it the case before that you werent able to do that because you didnt have the capabilities and now that you do thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc no absolutely not i would say its twofold right we just did the biggest conversion of the bank in august in the middle of the pandemic under the fiserv dna core processing system weve had partnered with fiserv throughout the entire platform for all our major systems that plugin through fiserv so we have a lets call ourselves a very strong partnership with fiserv we cocollaborated on the commercial side as well so the commercial cash flow management solutions program that we have is a fiserv product its a fiserv product thats used throughout the entire country and that was not the same product that was there in july so this is a fairly new opportunity that we believe is not an excuse that our systems is not compatible so i think we have a good solution and now theres a push and by the way this hasnt been steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc this is only since august right so were just starting the year its not even a year old but we have this solution and now its a matter of getting the customers onboard onboarding them training them and focusing on the push at the top level this is at the board level all the way down to the staff this is where we should be going with the franchise getting away from the traditional thrift funding steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it i appreciate the color thanks and congratulations tom thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive

through the ltvs but ill go through them again the ltvs in that book is about for multi and for cre and as i discussed looking at that portfolio a lot of these most of these customers still when we put some of these customers in io structure for six months they are north of a oneforone capacity to continue making these payments we will reevaluate them as we get into the aprilmay period when that six month roll comes due and see where theyre at and were working with them and clearly like i said manhattan is the area of focus because we see more of these loans coming out of the manhattan market not so much the other borrowers matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay so its a six month structure as well thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah six months yeah six months io yes matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc and also thats all the taxes as well matthew breese q analyst stephens inc theyre all are paying us thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah all paying us thats right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 one thing you had mentioned i just wanted a little bit more color on explanation you mentioned the hedge the potential for that to roll off can you just remind me what that was why it was put on the size and how does it benefit the nim by bps john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah it was a billion total notional hedge that we did that swapped from fixed to floating on our against our loan portfolio in the last layer hedge so it was a three year swap that we did so that matures in february of so if we do not reup or get into another transaction like that we will see those loans which are right now in essence pricing off a three month libor go back to their fixed rate on our books so youll see a big pickup on that billion back to the normal fixed rate of those loans thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i would categorize as a entry risk hedge john j pinto a executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay all right thank you and then the last one for me is just in regards to expenses i hear you loud and clear i just wanted to make sure the message was that in terms of new hires or going into new verticals you feel like what you have in place the million in annual expenses thats a good run rate and you feel like the nie to asset ratio sub is a place that you can thats something you can maintain thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc i think its a fair estimate of where we are today and i feel comfortable with those numbers i mean obviously were elevated on fdic we strive for a very strong efficiency ratio i think we met our goals last year on efficiency ratio despite uptakes and weve identified it what they were and we had the fdic cost we had some medallion related expenses as we took in some oreo pieces on the medallion side but going forward bringing in some customer service people is not going to move the needle reallocating resources internally towards the concept of the push towards full relationship lending is i dont were not going to change the game somehow this is not going to happen where were going to change the product mix the product mix will change as we pick partners right but the low lying fruit will be harvested here and were going to work very hard in harvesting with the relationship with the brokers the lenders as well as our deposit gatherers together as a team and were going to work as a team to try to harvest that low lying fruit that weve always talked about but now were going to put into action and i think the system really helps us too the systems conversion was extremely key for us and im going to reemphasize a lot of our competitors that i want to work on a serious system with the same vendor are going to reup down the road so doing it through while joining the family makes a lot more sense new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thats all i had thank you thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc sure thanks operator thank you our final questions comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please proceed with your question christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks for taking my question tom and john i just wanted to ask about the deposits specialist that tom you alluded to would these be possible hires in other markets besides new york and is that a strategy to kind of incent them well in this individually kind of stack up a team thomas robert cangemi a director president chief executive officer new york community bancorp inc absolutely ohio florida jersey new york ph manhattan were going to be very proactive to try to create value here by looking at these opportunities and no question that these people are portable and weve seen it happen in our backyard and most of our competitors are very successful at it were going to give it a shot as well but its not going to be a major restructuring expense still its going to be done in a methodical way and i think we have to just utilize the platform and the system and ultimately the true change will come when we paint the canvas on new products and that will be full service commercial banking type products over time typically through a partnership and like i indicated i think weve spent the effort on the conversion weve spent the effort on getting our cash flow management systems solutions correct now its a matter of looking at what we have with the current existing relationships working with the brokers working with the customer base and perhaps changing some of the type of products within typical opportunity within a customers book of business weve always been multifamily and cre no reason why they cant do lines of credit for these wealthy customers that want that and thats why theyre banking with another bank and we dont have all their deposits so we have to be mindful of that its opportunistic thats not a difficult change for our system to win those types of products like is said were not going to do a residential loan book from scratch right were not going to open up a credit card business from scratch but if we have a unique opportunity within the ma but marketplace where people can bring partnerships to the table we would evaluate that and then hopefully have a full service branch platform there right now its a very thrift like which over time and im going to make a statement people may not hear this but when you think about the traditional thrift model ive never seen a thrift convert themselves organically doing it successful it has to be done through traditional ma transactions that makes sense on a partnership perspective and i will never call it acquisitions because acquisitions are difficult partnerships work acquisitions could be challenging when you partner with the right partner thats willing to put their expertise on the table and their wealth on the table everyone has common goals new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and
