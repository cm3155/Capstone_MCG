officer director western alliance bancorp thank you miles good morning everyone ill make some brief comments about our third quarter results and then ill turn the call over to dale one year ago on our q3 call we discussed our plans to temper balance sheet growth to bolster capital and liquidity in order to reinforce our financial foundation and position the bank to navigate through a volatile rate environment the events of the spring caused by duration mismatch at several regional banks validated the importance of our strategy and accelerated its implementation to surgical balance sheet reposition a recalibration of our business model to enhance overall liquidity and deposit granularity is designed to make the balance sheet unassailable in the event of another significant market disruption as a result our cet1 capital has grown from a year ago to today our hfi loan to deposit ratio has improved from to to provide enhanced protection to depositors and cement the stability of our deposit base insured and collateralized deposits have risen from at yearend to in order to fortify our liquidity position we have materially increased our cash and investment securities and now have billion of high quality liquid asset treasuries having established strong capital liquidity and deposit granularity a sturdy foundation has been laid to deliver earnings improvement going forward over the last several quarters we have prioritized stabilizing and growing deposits as well as optimizing the liability structure by paying down borrowings this has led to net interest margin growing from our second quarter trough as we have sustained improvement in our funding structure western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 lowered our adjusted efficiency and produced above peer return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity over the next one to two quarters we will complete the optimization of our funding structure and be well positioned to deploy excess core deposits into loan growth in the third quarter western alliance profitability strong liquidity generation and stable asset quality are proof points to the dexterity of our diversified business model before handing the call over to dale i wanted to highlight the drivers of our strong deposit growth in q3 core commercial clients both new and existing were the primary sources contributing to billion of growth mortgage warehouse and hoa pushed growth upward and the regional network posted a second consecutive quarter of vigorous deposit contributions overall deposit costs increased basis points though overall cost of interest bearing liabilities compressed basis points to in q3 as we utilized deposits to pay down higher cost borrowings which dale will comment on later liquidity came in ratably over the quarter to push down our average borrowings core commercial deposits cost a marginal including cost of earning credit rates cultivating multiproduct customer relationships remains critical for solidifying and growing client relationships which has held in the mid80 range in recent quarters our digital consumer channel a source of liquidity uncorrelated with our core commercial business lines generated approximately million this quarter at attractive rates relative to the marginal cost of repaid borrowings in short i feel confident in the vitality of our deposit franchise and how it sets up for future success now dale will take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken for the quarter western alliance generated net income of million eps of and pre provision net revenue of million net interest income increased million during the quarter to million through the repricing of earning assets as well as a reduction in higher cost borrowings noninterest income increased million to million which included approximately million of nonrecurring pretax items such as fair value adjustments amerihome was moderately impacted by rising mortgage rates and treasury yields with mortgage banking revenue declining million to million as lock volume fell quarteroverquarter and production margins compressed slightly to basis points noninterest expense growth was primarily driven by higher deposit costs and software licensing and depreciation expenses deposit costs of million demonstrated our deposit share gains from new indiscernible previous clients returning funds to the ph range provision expense was million due to stable asset quality and loan growth concentrated in low loss categories our provision modeling remains conservative given the weighting of the moodys consensus forecast in severely adverse scenarios which in aggregate implies an probability of recession lastly our tax rate rose because of discrete nondeductible items in the quarter we expect our tax rate to fall back to between and going forward overall we made substantial progress in increasing onbalance sheet liquidity with investments in cash higher quarteroverquarter mostly from adding more high quality liquid assets deposit share gains and balance sheet remixing also pushed wholesale borrowings lower cash western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 cash and cash equivalents alone totaled billion up from billion last quarter with our strong deposit growth and capital levels we are likely to reclassify billion of nonamerihome heldforsale loans back to heldforinvestment as organic loan growth has slowed these transferred loans are short duration low credit risk assets which we believe are better served generating interest income for the bank going forward remaining loans heldforsale consists entirely of amerihome residential inventory to be sold to the gses and have an average duration of only about two weeks including billion of loans transferred from heldforsale loans heldforinvestment rose billion to indiscernible as ken mentioned deposits increased billion to billion at quarterend mortgage servicing rights increased in part due to the higher rate environment and stood at billion on september total borrowings declined by million to billion at quarterend but average borrowings declined nearly billion quarteroverquarter primarily from the repayment of federal home loan bank borrowings and private equity lines obtained from march earlier this year organic heldforinvestment loans grew million primarily from ci and centered around mortgage warehouse msr financing and corporate finance with smaller contributions from regional banking hfi construction and land loan growth of million derived mostly from light banking loans reclassified from held forsale status given the national undersupply of homes we still view the macro backdrop for this product favorably despite the elevated rate environment total deposit growth of billion resulted primarily from an increase in core deposits and also reflects a reduction in wholesale brokered deposits of over million core deposit growth was fueled by billion in noninterestbearing dda growth led by mortgage warehouse and billion in savings and money market growth noninterestbearing dda comprise a third of our total deposits of which approximately have no cash payments of earnings credits quartertodate deposit growth has surpassed billion though semiannual seasonality in mortgage warehouse deposits and tax to insurance escrow funds will pull this number down as payments are made this quarter turning now to net interest drivers stable repricing at a higher rate environment increased the yield on earning assets optimization of the liability structure by growing deposits to pay down indiscernible shortterm borrowings led to a lower cost of funding liability funding the securities portfolio grew billion to billion as we prioritized adding hqla to the balance sheet the yield on total investments expanded basis points to billion in securities yielding are also expected to mature by yearend with another billion yielding maturing in similarly hfi loans increased basis points to with a quarterend spot rate of in a higher for longer rate environment we expect to benefit from favorable asset pricing tailwinds total fixed to variable loan maturities are expected to average billion per quarter for the first three quarters of our strategy to rightsize the liability funding structure through increased savings and money market accounts resulted in a 41basispoint increase in the cost of interestbearing deposits importantly this enabled a billion reduction in average shortterm borrowings to of interestbearing liabilities which resulted in a 5basis point reduction in the overall cost of interestbearing liabilities to in the third quarter western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 as noted on our last earnings call we believe net interest income and net interest margin reached a cyclical trough in the second quarter net interest income grew nearly despite a modest contraction in average earning assets and the margin expanded basis points quarter over quarter to considering the impact of future rate changes our rate risk profile is modestly asset sensitive our plus basis points rate shock analysis on a static balance sheet indicates net interest income is expected to lift approximately and decrease a similar amount on a minus basis points shock however considering where comprehend through review of interest rate risk we projected increase in earnings at risk from a 100basispoint negative shock on a static balance sheet which is inclusive of estimated declines in ecrrelated deposit costs additionally in a lower rate environment mortgage banking acts as a shock absorber to our asset sensitive balance sheet from increased refinance activity and gain on sale margin expansion our efficiency ratio of was basis points higher than in q2 though our adjusted efficiency ratio excluding the impact of ecrs ph fell basis points to as mortgage warehouse average balances with ecrs increased billion to billion in the third quarter lower compensation expense resulted from normal seasonal factors and mitigated higher software licensing and data processing costs we still view a mid to upper40 efficiency ratio as indicative of the right mediumterm level of investments to fund new business initiatives and the ongoing evolution of our risk management framework preprovision net revenue was million for the quarter solid profitability was maintained in q3 with a stable return on average assets of on a larger balance sheet return on average tangible common equity of was modestly below our q2 level as our capital indiscernible our proactive credit mitigation strategy has been effective thus far in normalizing credit environment asset quality was stable in q3 as the aggregate net increase in special mention loans to classified assets was only million notably nonperforming assets declined million to million or basis points of total assets quarterly net loan chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans compared to million or basis points in the second quarter due to growth in low to no loss categories in conjunction with stable asset quality led to a smaller provision expense even in a normalizing credit environment our total funded acl increased million from the prior quarter to million as hfi growth occurred almost entirely in near zero loss categories most prominently in mortgage warehouse as a reminder even after repaying two creditlinked notes of our loan portfolio was still protected with any losses incurred to be covered by a thirdparty the total loan acl to funded loans ticked down basis points to basis points but did increase basis points to of nonperforming loans we view our allowance as appropriate especially when considering the material portion of loans covered by indiscernible credit protection from creditlinked notes and low loan loss categories additionally a sizable portion of our loan growth has been concentrated in low to no loss products our loan portfolio is diversified across indiscernible segments with almost a quarter of it either credit protected government guaranteed or cash secured and over half of the portfolio is either insured or resistant to economic volatility if adjusted for these factors our acl ratio rises to of loans western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 our strong organic capital growth lifted the cet1 ratio to or indiscernible when adjusted for aoci and tax effected unrealized held to maturity securities marks our tangible common equity to total assets decreased approximately basis points from q2 to as the balance sheet expanded modestly while capital growth was curtailed by a higher aoci mark given the 45basispoint rise in the fiveyear treasury during the quarter aoci reached ph reduced tangible common equity by million inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share increased in the quarter to the quarteroverquarter increase resulted from our earnings outpacing industrywide aoci headwinds stemming from rising rates ill now turn the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale our guidance for the rest of continues to be informed by the strategies and priorities laid out in our prior earnings call so as we look forward to q4 you can expect loans and core deposits are expected to be fairly flat to several hundred million dollars higher in q4 net deposit growth will be impacted by normal q4 seasonal reductions in mortgage warehouse deposits offset by growth in the regional divisions and the digital consumer channel deposits should still outpace loan growth going into we expect loan and deposit growth to return to our prior guidance regarding capital having close to basis points of our mediumterm cet1 target of we forecast continued although more gradual progress towards this goal which we remain on track to achieve in net interest margin should remain in line with our q3 level in a range of to supported by asset pricing tailwinds and additional if more tempered borrowing repayment opportunities our adjusted efficiency ratio which excludes the impact of deposit costs should remain consistent with q3 levels regarding operating ppnr we expect q4 to be generally consistent with q3 excluding the onetime items noted and acknowledging that mortgage banking revenue will be influenced by the impact of the rate environment on mortgage gain on sale asset quality remains manageable projects continue to be supported by sponsors based on our conservative underwriting and low advance rates credit losses are still expected to be to basis points through this economic cycle at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your calls questions sorry western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from casey haire of jefferies casey your line is open please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah great thanks good morning everyone maybe first question kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc on the nim can you just walk us through kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc good morning just walk us through i guess what the nim guide presumes in the way of borrowings obviously your deposit growth very strong quartertodate i think ken you mentioned you do expect that to pay down and so just that would bring the borrowings which were up pretty significantly periodend versus the average in just wondering where that would end up in the fourth quarter here dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we have some seasonality within deposit categories that affects this number but the direction of borrowings is going to continue to be down so we paid off several of our more expensive funding sources that we achieved or acquired late in the first quarter and theres a little bit left i expect well pay down that amount as well so we should continue to see kind of improvement there where you see were reasonably balanced on target for loan to deposit growth this quarter i think you should see some kind of modest improvement in ending balances as well and i think the average balances should improve somewhat as well but not to the degree they did in the third quarter over the second kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah casey as youve seen we took down our shortterm borrowings by million but any time we have any excess liquidity floating around well use it to pay down borrowings so the average borrowings declined billion in the quarter and that helped bring down our lower funding rate western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just dale wanted to follow up on your comments on the fixed rate asset repricing benefit in the first three quarters of i think you said billion per quarter can you give us a sense of where dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah casey haire q analyst jefferies llc like what the blended yield is on that and what that can reprice through just trying to quantify what the repricing benefit could be dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so in terms of what the repricing could be these are coming off at something in the kind of around the higher and rates today have spreads of really not less than basis points bps from there and so indiscernible another rate increase in there so i would take that on top of sofr today so something in the lower casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so over billion of loans in the first three quarters with bp left dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp approximately casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay all right just last one for me on the expenses obviously that was the one thing that kind of surprised negatively this quarter on the deposit costs so i have the deposit with ecr the dda with ecr up but the deposit costs were up so im just trying to like why the disconnect is there a different pricing dynamic today than there was historically just trying to understand that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well it was we had higher balances and higher rates and i think the average balance was elevated the average balance was up during the quarter so it wasnt let me approach it differently in terms of the spreads that these clients received there were virtually no change casey haire q analyst jefferies llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 okay all right so we dont have the average balances so just periodend was up the averages was up higher and then indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc as well dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great thank you dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan steven your line is open please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody i want to start regarding kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc getting back to the million per quarter loan growth target at billion deposit growth in once you guys get to the mid80 loan to deposit ratio target whats more likely that you guys dial up the loan growth expectation at that point or that you dial down the deposit growth dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp youll see on the asset side youll see that that will be the lever that will be used steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so youre thinking keep the billion deposit target intact and then dial up expectations for asset growth western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah this is ken i think so i think some of the investments that weve made in a number of our depositcentric business lines will continue to propel deposits forward along the guide that we gave and as we recalibrate to a mid loan to deposit ratio well then turn off the loan growth machine weve proven here over time that we can generate sound thoughtful reasonable loan growth with very little asset quality problems steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then going back to caseys question on expenses excluding the ecrrelated deposit costs which flow through so if we put those aside how are you guys thinking about expense growth over the next year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so running from q3 to q4 expenses absent the deposit costs will be relatively flat okay and as we enter into there will be marginal expense growth and that marginal expense growth will be predicated on continuing to invest in new products new services new business lines continuing to build out our risk management framework the hallmark of western alliance has been this continuous investment through all cycles to kind of grow the business for future quarters and years and so as long as the risk return and the investment returns are there well continue to do that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it so from an efficiency ratio perspective are you thinking that well have improvement through or that will keep about where you ended the fourth quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah id say about where we landed in the fourth quarter back to your actually your first question as we probably exit the second quarter and we achieve our loan to deposit ratio well be able to step on the accelerator of loan growth and that will generate higher interest income which should provide the denominator of that equation to grow at a faster pace but right now if youre modeling i would say keep it consistent with q4 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right but it sounds like revenues set to accelerate here with the margin being more stable like you said more loan growth coming in next year but we should think youre going to spend more of that at least at this juncture right because it seems like the setup is the efficiency ratio improvement next year but youre saying at least at this point dont expect that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i think it is set up that way but its a little bit deferred in terms of when that takes place because of the reasons ken was talking about that were going to be sluggish on having the loan growth really kind of match to western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 of the deposit growth as we continue to pull that number indiscernible number down for a couple more quarters steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks steven operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw chris your line is open please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks dale and ken i want to go about that one a little bit different youre going to be at your target within a couple of quarters if not one to two quarters im not sure im prepared to ask this but like wouldnt you be thinking about a share buyback at some point next year given the capital accumulation and your stock price kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think thats a fair question to ask i think there are a couple of things that will inform our decision one as we to grow and we continue to get closer and closer to the billion threshold we have to take into account the aoci charge that will be applied against it and so we want to continue to grow our cet1 ratio really is the target its not the goal and we expect to grow through that all right thats one and number two youll see the cet1 ratio moderate in the back half of the year in terms of growth because well probably step on the accelerator for loan growth once we achieve our loan to deposit ratio dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp and one of the reasons our indiscernible so quickly is because we have really curtailed our risk weighted asset increases and that will tick up again as loan growth recalibrates kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i mean we just indiscernible weve improved our cet1 ratio basis points since we went on this risk weighted asset diet and really paying a lot more attention to that and we slowed our loan growth and with our organic earnings we were able to move that number rather quickly from a year ago which was to where we are now at christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 okay that makes sense it feels like theres a combination of maybe both that could be considered in the back half of the year as the aoci mark narrows and you get through your targets it feels like a little bit of both okay okay thats fair dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp even in were in higher for longer christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then maybe a bigger picture question dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp go head chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no keep going im sorry sorry dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i was just going to say even if were higher for longer on rates we will see that aoci mark decline simply because the duration of the portfolio under five years is going to going to continue to come down kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp chris just something id say to you and the rest of the folks on the line were looking to build a very strong foundational balance sheet here all right and not be sucked into any of the problems that you saw in the first quarter with a number of banks having their duration mismatch and we just want to never go through that again or if we have to have it have a minimal effect on us and thats where our intent is to continue to raise capital levels and also to build our liquidity christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and maybe just one followup i think youve talked about a midteens roe through the cycle i guess updated thoughts on that given higher for longer dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i think theres so as our loan to deposit ratio continues to show kind of where were headed we are going to have more high quality liquid assets i think we can over time our expense ratio can fall into the on an adjusted basis and so i think high teens works for us kind of intermediate to longerterm western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc high teens okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from bernard von gizycki of deutsche bank bernard your line is open please go ahead bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes hi good morning so just on deposit costs maybe i can ask it a little differently but when you think of how your ecrrelated deposit growth based on your guidance expectations could go for if rates are steady from here throughout versus if we do see rate cuts in the second half of how would you think the deposit costs could migrate under those two different rate paths dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well ecrs are going to have a very high beta they have on the way up and we expect them to have a high beta on the way down and so if we get rate cuts well be able to i think well be able to push those down kind of almost in lockstep in addition some of these have ecrs that are effective fed funds plus some number of basis points and part of the reason why i think pressure really came on the industry overall on deposits is because of the competition from the bond market so as people are comfortable that that the fomc is done with what whatever rate increases theyre going to contemplate i do think that thats going to relax some of the pressure on deposit costs for the industry kind of writ large and i think that may give us an opportunity to tweak some of those adjustment figures that we might have on some of those ecrs kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah dale gave you the rate size and id also add for us we expect another basis points in q4 with several cuts towards the back end of next year so deposit costs will rise and fall along with those rate cuts but if youre talking about total dollars also keep in mind if we exceed our guide which we have in the last two quarters youll see the volume aspect take hold and youll see dollarwise the ecrs rise so its going to be a little bit of a rate volume mix as we go forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp in addition what ken was alluding to earlier in terms of these deposit initiatives we have but we think that we have some of these will grow more quickly than what our warehouse deposits which is kind of heavy ecr dependent have done and that would give us a broader distribution and more diversification on our funding structure bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 great and i appreciate that color maybe just on office cre i know your credits been really good but if look at the exposure i believe it increased from billion in to billion just wondering any color you could provide on the increase and if there is any loan sales kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp tim timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp tim bruckner here i can take that any increase would have been inflight balance increases fund off of tenant improvements itd be good news money with signed leases we didnt increase new exposure in office kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah ill just say as long you brought that up remember of our office portfolio sits in suburban locations only sits in central business districts about sits in midtown and our office book represents new construction or new vintage class a in core submarkets so again we go with experienced sponsors proven track records in adding value and repositioning our ltv there is about bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from brandon king of truist securities brandon your line is open please proceed brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to follow up on the topic of ecr deposits i mean just to confirm are you stating that composition of ddas the dda based ecr deposit are you indiscernible higher over the course of next year western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i think the acquisition of dda funds in this elevated rate environment is just quite challenging so i mean the dda that we had increase in the third quarter was kind of overwhelmingly a mortgage warehouse and i think that straight flat out dda i mean we have had success in the regions during the quarter as well to some degree but i think most of the deposits were going to be getting are going to be in either interestbearing checking or money market accounts brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay got it that make sense and then i wanted to talk about the shift from the held for sale loans to held for investment and particularly to the lot banking loans could you walk us through the original thought process of designating those held for sale and then elaborate more on the decision to bring those as held for investment kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah let me take that so this was a liquidity decision right so in q2 we grew our total deposits by about billion here this quarter we grew a little over billion also want to emphasize we paid down brokered deposits by million so otherwise we would have grown it by billion and back from q1 we put some loans into hfs in order to be ready to create additional pools of liquidity which arent needed and so we moved these loans from hfs back into hfi and regarding your lot banking question that you alluded to there generally our lot banking programs are all on schedule with the builders and really the builders cannot afford to lose any of this inventory and lose control of their for sale demand so again this is segment of loans category that we like a great deal and have a very good riskreward attribute to it and weve never since weve been doing it here at the bank suffered a loss on that brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thats all i had thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator thank you our next question is from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america ebrahim your line is open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just maybe dale when we think about the billion per quarter deposit outlook for next year per quarter just talk to us the source of that deposit growth where thats coming at and what is your assumption around the rate at which these deposits are coming on is it meaningfully below sofr just some color around how we should think about that and just how thats probably going to impact your nii nim outlook until rates get cut thanks western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so ill take the first half of that and toss it over to dale for the second half but regarding where is the source of the deposit strength coming from next year i think youll see first of all youll see it from our traditional lines hoa is projected to have a good year next year warehouse lendingnote financing generally is traditionally strong yearafteryear the critical item there is what happens in the mortgage industry it could accelerate a little bit more if rates fall back and well see a little bit more deposit growth there but into next year we are looking for a number of our newer business lines to contribute in greater sums than they previously have namely our settlement service business our business escrow services business and our corporate trust business those three should have above growth rate to prior years history here and should really contribute but ill also say that the regions this is the second quarter in a row the regions has had very solid growth what we like most about the regions is theyre a little more granular okay not big and chunky as some of the other parts of our business and last but not least weve had tremendous success with our digital consumer platform and that has really exceeded any of our wildest imaginations in terms of the numbers we initially forecasted for it and that too will continue throughout dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp the larger preponderance of the pricing that were getting for new business ranges from the and thats really in the regions to the and that includes some of the things we talked about earlier in mortgage warehouse and some of these other channels i think were going to be kind of in the middle there weighted average something in the and i think thats probably a good target for ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful and maybe dale sorry if i missed it just in terms of your outlook given just where mortgage ph are at how are you thinking about what origination gain on sale fees could look like in the absence of any rate relief kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thanks ill take that one as we look forward q3 to q4 mortgage servicing income should be sustained quartertoquarter maybe even a slight growth as our msr balances grow in q4 you generally have a seasonal falloff that happens i think it may be a little more acute with the higher rates that we see here presently ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 operator thank you our next question comes from matthew clark of piper sandler matthew your line is open please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey thank you just a few questions around credit or maybe one or two here just the reduction in special mention nonaccruals can you speak to how these credits were resolved did most of them ph cure or did you push them out of the bank just trying to get a sense for the workout process timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure yeah tim bruckner again so im going to take the nonaccrual nonperforming first about half of the improvement in that area is pay out or pay down okay the other half would be upgrade to performing categories with regard to special mention we base our credit culture on early elevation and so we use that category very much as a transitional category so as we signaled on the prior calls we completed the portfolio review we moved assets into that category and then we pressed for speedy resolutions so with respect to the movements in and out those are dictated then by our strategy which generally involves required remargin in this environment matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then the other one for me around expenses can you speak to the investments you may still need to make to become or be considered 100plusbillion bank assuming you get treated like one beforehand by the regulators kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think the second part of that question is right on which is most banks in our size category will start to be treated like billion bank well before you get there and youve got to build that framework in advance and that framework is beginning to look and feel a little more sophisticated around capital stress testing around liquidity stress testing and the framework that kind of evolves around that as we get bigger well have to make more investments into reporting that the larger banks over billion will have to do but we believe that starting it early and kind of building it into the run rate because then theres going to be cost that youre going to have to have to continue with the not only development but the reporting and the management and the monitoring were trying to build it in now and kind of build out towards that matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks again kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 operator our next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson gary your line is open please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning a couple of questions in terms of the ecr deposits can you give us the average for that in the quarter versus the billion quarterend dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we can get back to you on that one gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you and then in terms of your comments on kind of expenses and kind of marginal growth is that inclusive of the fdic special assessment kicks in in the first quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co or should we think of that as being on top of indiscernible dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we were considering the special assessment which hasnt been defined yet in terms of exactly how its going to come out i mean i think that could be revised yeah were that excludes that we think thats just really kind of below the line and i think thats how the street will treat it gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and then my last question in terms of ken when youre kind of running through the fourth quarter outlook and you mentioned net chargeoffs if i heard you correctly you kind of also suggested net chargeoffs through the economic cycle in the to 15basispoint range beyond just the fourth quarter did i hear that correctly kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thats correct gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks gary operator our next question comes from andrew terrell of stephens andrew your line is open please proceed andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning just one quick one for me i wanted to ask on page of the presentation the earnings at risk disclosure that you provide in the down bps scenario the up for earnings there can you talk about just your comfortability with that level is that where you would like the company to holistically be at or any changes youd like to make to that position and then can you also talk about what the underlying mortgage assumptions are in the down bps scenario from a gain on sale margin and volume perspective dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so theyre not dramatically different we do think margins would increase i mean look at kind of what happened during indiscernible pandemic where margins basically tripled during that period of time were comfortable with this in terms of kind of a decline and that were a little bit better off a little tighter on net interest income but stronger in terms of expenses related to those ecrs as well as amerihome revenue a 100basis point decline is not enough to ph gen up a meaningful refinance business but we do think it would help on the purchase side in terms of what wed be seeing on volume and if we were down basis points we really think that thats going to open a window for a fair amount of refinancing thats been done over say the past year as well as have something close enough that youll get more refinance activity on a cash out basis somebody moving from a to a rather than all the way up to something in the mid to higher andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for taking the question dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo timur your line is open please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning one more on ecr for me i guess as you look at fourth quarter specifically how much of that dda growth is expected to stick around and then should we see a commensurate reduction in ecr during the fourth quarter if dda balances do go down western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah you should dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i mean the volatility in deposits in q4 is around the mortgage warehouse business which carries most of the ecr credits and as that volume drops you should see a corresponding decline in the ecr in the operating expense line timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and i guess just given the seasonality in the warehouse business how likely is it that that billion of dda growth you saw in the third quarter how much of that actually rolls off with that seasonality next quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i think theres two things going on so the growth that we had in the third quarter was a baseline improvement which i think that has legs and staying power the decline were going to see in the fourth quarter is from taxes in insurance escrow funds explicitly so while that will come down in the fourth quarter we expect to retain the higher deposit levels kind of moving forward into so we should see a more pronounced rebound coming into q1 than the decline that we see q4 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then last quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats understood thank you and then last quarter you had made a point to mention that the borrowings are being paid down or quite expensive i think the number was sofr plus bps im just wondering with the remaining borrowings left whats some of the higher cost borrowings that we should continue to see coming down over the next couple of quarters how much of that expensive borrowings are still left on balance sheet dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 yeah as of quarterend we still had billion that is at s plus i expect that will be paid off this quarter and theres also a little bit of an average balance benefit because not all of the payoffs that were done in the third quarter they were ill call it ratably over the quarter and so some of that benefit is not recognized in the third quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp that helps support our indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly from okay and then lastly for me just on the mention of hqla and tying that back into the million threshold i know youve been growing each quarter now hqla now for a couple of quarters but is any of that build in relation to that billion threshold and i guess whats the remixing of the bond book look like with additional hqla purchases and how punitive might that be in this rate environment dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i think it is all a bit related and there is maybe a gentle slope in terms of hqla looking for kind of billion number over time which obviously ph were not close to but i think thats part of it i think part of it is as well as we pull down the loan to deposit ratio those funds are going to be invested in something with higher levels of liquidity like weve talked about so it is i dont want to say indiscernible thats not a big step variable here its going to be a gentle climb into higher levels of high quality liquid assets over the next couple of years timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the questions dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator our next question comes from david chiaverini of wedbush securities david your line is open please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i had a followup on the rate sensitivity so in an environment where the fed does pivot and we see basis points of rate cuts i see nii down but clearly on the ecr side we should see some cuts there as well or declines there how should we think about the ppnr impact of 100basispoint cut in rates dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well if you go to ppnr thats really going to be your earnings at risk so youre going to see lower levels of expenses like you identified but youre also going to see higher levels of revenue from amerihome the mortgage western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 operation and so on ph an ear basis this really is were really talking about a kind of a ppnr kind of framework and that would tick up david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for that and then shifting over to a followup on credit quality you mentioned about the roughly billion of quarterly cre maturities next year can you talk about the health of your borrowers and their ability to withstand higher rates as these loans mature and reprice higher timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure so first i think that discussion was in the context of the investment portfolio kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well its billion but it was of total loans timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah total loans not just cre kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp so our cre is entirely floating rate one i think thats important and is entirely not central business districts so when we underwrite an office we underwrite suburban office and so weve already dealt with the roll so to speak because the interest rates have already come off and weve already made the grading decisions and then weve already executed our strategy and at this point over of that portfolio weve either affirmed the structure that exists or weve restructured and remargined in the present environment david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator our next question comes from david smith of autonomous david your line is open please proceed david smith q analyst autonomous research western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 thank you so within the deposit outlook for the fourth quarter can you give us some more details on whats embedded about the mortgage warehouse decline if we take the regional deposit growth of billion and billion digital consumer this past quarter that would imply something like a billion reduction or so in mortgage warehouse does that sound reasonable kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah that sounds very reasonable so thats whats going to happen in mortgage warehouse and then you would have the digital consumer platform the regions and some of the specialty lines picking up that flat to kind of get us back to even just ill say this its kind of important we made a strategic change with our warehouse lending business over the last year or so where we used to have more pi accounts which saw a lot more volatility monthtomonth we moved more to tax and insurance accounts right same clients different liquidity deposits and so you dont see the big swings monthtomonth but you do get them towards the middle of the year and towards the end of the year when they drop down and then have to rebuild up so as these balances build off theyll build up starting december thereabouts this year and theyll build up for the next six months going out into so this should have a little more stability thats just a change that we made here david smith q analyst autonomous research thank you and given how much of the ecr balances are in mortgage warehouse is it possible that we could see deposit costs down quarteronquarter in the fourth quarter or is that going to happen too late in the quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no i think you could see it down in q4 absolutely david smith q analyst autonomous research and just thinking about the nim guide of to against in the third quarter youve got the tailwinds of the fixed loan repricing youve got some more borrowing paydown seems like more tailwinds i just wonder if you could break out some more of the headwinds you see there that are going to stop it from elevating higher than dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so you also saw that we had an increase in our cash position at quarterend relative to last quarter and the average balance for the quarter and so that is going to consume some of that otherwise opportunity to have a higher yield higher spread david smith q analyst autonomous research got it and lastly on capital are you saying you think cet1 ratio could decline in absolute terms as you stepup loan growth in the second half next year or youll just continue to grow more slowly western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no we dont expect a decline as i said the targets and then well push through that target we just expect it to grow at a slower pace once we cross over cross through david smith q analyst autonomous research are there any more inorganic levers you can pull here after like the cln repayment or is it a basically going to be a function of earnings and asset growth from here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp its going to be a function of earnings and continuing to watch our risk weighted assets and making sure we optimize that quartertoquarter david smith q analyst autonomous research all right thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator thank you our next question is from brody preston of ubs brody your line is open please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hi everyone how are you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i want to just to follow up to make sure i was following the warehouse commentary correctly and the kind of piece it together from last quarter so i think we were youre up billion in july during the last conference call and it looks like you ended up billion this quarter and so that came down at the end of the quarter and then were expecting another billion of potential runoff from there in the fourth quarter just on a seasonal kind of low point am i following that math correctly dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 so as ken was alluding to earlier we have theres the escrow funds from a mortgage warehouse client are bifurcated into two pieces one is taxes and insurance thats the one that we think is more attractive because its a little more stable profile and the other was principal and interest well principal and interest is on a monthly cycle but funds build up and then somewhere around the 20th 24th of the month they get spun out to the government sponsored enterprises the other ones build up for six months some even longer than that and then theyre paid to the taxing authorities so the preponderance of our portfolio comes from california and so california taxes i think are due in november or something like this and so youre going to see that come down so what you saw earlier was really just normal typical behavior and so say in the middle of the month youre going to have a higher number in principal and interest that then comes back down so even though that number came down from where it was maybe in midjuly to the end of september the actual balance trend is actually still positive growing during that particular time were just hitting a high point on the monthly ph sign wave that you get on pi payments so that trend looks strong because of the balance from quarterend to quarterend looks good what were saying is the balance from quarterend to quarterend for the fourth quarter is going to be down not because of pi which looks good but because of ti and not because of client impairment just simply because thats the cycle in terms of how those funds are distributed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay i appreciate the clarification and then i wanted to just ask on the spot loan yields i think if i remember in the slide correctly it was on the spot rate for the yield which i guess i wanted to relate that to the residential portfolio to kind of get towards that spot yield it implies that you have to get more expansion in that residential yield and so how should we be thinking about residential loan yields going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i dont think residential loan yields are going to move much i mean the cprs on that stuff today are kind of about the lowest anyones ever seen and so thats just kind of gently bleeding off that said this is kind of the point on why we mentioned hey we have about billion billion of loans rolling off repricing every quarter and so that could come up now a small piece of that is going to be residential but the rest of it as well so if you take the residential and those loans are again are coming in thats something that begins with an i mean theyre basically look sofr today at to of that so those run off and are being replaced at kind of notably higher rates and even the variable rate ones are being replaced at higher spreads because of maybe uncertainty in the economy brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc can you guys still hear me dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp and relative tightness yeah western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah did you hear dales answer brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah it just cut out there for a minute no i guess that makes sense its just that the loan yields jumped up a bit this quarter on the resi book and that kind of caught me by surprise dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well we did some modest dispositions of residential loans brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i feel like im indiscernible operator with brody there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay operator sorry our final question today comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets jon your line is open please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks were going to get out of the weeds here for a second are you signaling flat eps for the fourth quarter just when i look at the guidance on slide is that what youre signaling dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so were signaling flat ppnr with some sensitivity to the gain on sale on the mortgage business depending on the stack up on rates that youre seeing here thats what were signaling jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay so thats difficult for us to model but youre saying ppnr excluding that its going to be relatively stable okay western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think thats indiscernible answer yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc ken yeah okay okay and then whats your level of confidence in loan growth returning in early dale mentioned the organic loan growth has slowed but whats your level of confidence in getting that greater than million a quarter back in the run rate kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah if youre talking about getting it back say starting in q3 or towards the end of q2 im confident about that yeah we have enough channel to bring in that loan growth i will say subject to macroeconomic events right subject to the economy and what we see so its not loan growth for loan growths sake if we dont like the credit were not lending against it but everything being equal we have a high degree of confidence in this company to grow loans in excess of million and loan growth will follow the deposit growth that weve laid out jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right okay how about as you look to i mean it seems like you have a couple of quarters left maybe one or two left to do what you need to do on funding im assuming that means that the margin starts especially if the fed is done im assuming that means the margin starts to lift in early which means ppnr also starts to lift in early am i looking at that the right way kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so for us weve got a rate increase in december which will carry into the first two quarters of at the end of the second quarter we have three rate decreases modeled in there the back end of the year so youve got to keep that in mind but as we think about audio gap as i said with deposits following the billion guide and loans growing at a moderate pace which is that million we see sort of the dexterity and agility of the national business line framework and the regional growth gives us confidence in that balance sheet construction going forward so thats sort of what were seeing along with stable asset quality as we go into jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah im looking at the consensus number it feels to me like its good it puts you at times earnings but your stock is down and im just curious if im missing anything when i think through your kind of mediumterm to longerterm outlook kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp im also surprised that the stock is down we were very pleased with this quarter and relative to other banks that have reported i thought we did fairly well and were not ready to give full guidance but i think you can take what we said directionally correct and model from there western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right ph for me anyway all right thank you see you in november kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thanks jon
