management discussion section operator good morning and welcome to keycorps third quarter earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to the chairman and ceo chris gorman please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp well thank you for joining us for keycorps third quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call today are don kimble our chief financial officer clark khayat our chief strategy officer and mark midkiff our chief risk officer on slide you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and nongaap financial measures it covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the questionandanswer segment of our call i am now moving to slide this morning we reported earnings of million or per common share our results included per share of additional loan loss provision in excess of net chargeoffs revenue was up relative to the second quarter driven by higher net interest income with a basis point increase in our net interest margin one thing that sets key apart is our approach to managing interest rate risk we have been very deliberate and intentional in managing with a longterm perspective while our net interest income is expected to be up double digits this year our balance sheet positioning presents a unique and significant upside for key over the next two years even in the event that rates remain at current levels we will experience a meaningful benefit as our securities and swaps reprice if we were to reprice our existing shortterm treasuries and swaps at todays interest rates we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of over billion our balance sheet benefits from our strong stable deposit base approximately of our deposits are in stable low cost retail and escrow balances in our commercial businesses approximately of our deposits are from core operating accounts we grew our loans again this quarter as we continue to add and expand relationships with our targeted clients our growth came from both our commercial and our consumer businesses we remain diligent in our underwriting practices and have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile our feebased businesses continue to reflect current market conditions investment banking and debt placement fees were up million from the prior quarter but down meaningfully from the yearago period reflecting the slowdown in the capital markets the new issue equity market is virtually nonexistent and the ma market is currently engaged in price discovery our pipelines remain solid particularly in ma however the pullthrough rate continues to be adversely impacted by market uncertainty we continue to see more activity moving on to our balance sheet in the third quarter we raised a record billion for our clients of which was retained on our balance sheet well above our longterm average of we will continue to do what is best for our clients including offering on and off balance sheet solutions keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 importantly we continue to make progress with respect to our targeted scale sectors which are not only high growth opportunities for key but areas that matter to both our country and our economy we have made a conscious decision to invest and focus our resources in certain vital growing sectors including healthcare renewable energy and affordable housing that impact both our clients and our communities both renewable energy and affordable housing are areas of investment and recently passed federal legislation combined the inflation reduction act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill have allocated over billion for energy transition in healthcare we are growing relationships with significant healthcare providers and expanding our laurel road business including our recent market extension to include nurses we are also very pleased with the early results from our may acquisition of gradfin since the gradfin team joined key they have held over individual consultations for refinance and public service loan forgiveness these consultations are with prequalified credential prospects all new to key our expenses continue to reflect our investments in our teammates digital and analytics we continue to balance expense discipline with investments for the future credit quality remained strong this quarter with net chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans of basis points nonperforming loans declined from the prior quarter we remain committed to delivering sound profitable growth by maintaining our discipline with respect to risk we will continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile which positions the company to perform well through all business cycles our capital remains a strength providing us with sufficient capacity to support our clients and return capital to our shareholders our fourth quarter guidance keeps us on the path to deliver positive operating leverage again in and concurrently make progress against each of our longterm goals we also continue to make tangible progress against the three commitments we announced earlier this year at our investor day these goals for are as follows growing relationship households in our consumer business by growing our senior bankers by and growing our laurel road member households to from we are on pace to achieve all three measures we have grown consumer households and laurel road members as well as a number of our senior bankers although our senior banker hires have been slower in the back half of this year reflecting current market conditions overall key delivered another solid quarter i remain confident in our future and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders with that i will turn it over to don to provide more details on the results of the quarter and our outlook don donald r kimble vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the third quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share up from the prior quarter and down from last year our results in the current quarter reflect strong core operating performance and the resiliency of our business model as we continue to navigate through the current market conditions preprovision net revenues was up from the second quarter with a increase in revenue driven by loan growth and by the way that we positioned our balance sheet to benefit from higher interest rates our results also reflect our ongoing focus on expense management and our strong risk profile turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from the yearago period and up from the prior quarter we continue to add and deepen client relationships across our franchise which drove loan keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 growth in both our commercial and consumer businesses commercial loans increased from last quarter reflecting broadbased growth across our industry verticals our consumer business continued with its strong performance as we saw residential real estate originations of billion consistent with our focus on healthcare segment of our consumer mortgage originations were to healthcare professionals laurel road originated approximately million of loans this quarter reflecting the ongoing federal student loan payment holiday as well as the impact of interest rates continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the third quarter of down billion or compared to both the prior quarter and the yearago period yearoveryear we saw a decline in nonoperating commercial deposit balances partially offset by an increase in retail deposits the decline from the prior quarter reflected lower commercial and consumer balances both areas were impacted by a reduction in stimulusrelated funds interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points from the prior quarter this resulted in a cumulative deposit beta of we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately of our total deposit mix in addition of our commercial deposits are from core operating accounts turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the third quarter compared to billion in the yearago quarter and billion in the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the third quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear net interest income benefited from higher earning asset balances and a favorable balance sheet mix as well as the benefit of higher interest rates quarteroverquarter net interest income and margin benefited from higher interest rates and loan growth partially offset by higher interestbearing deposit costs both net interest income and net interest margin reflect lower loan fees related to ppp loan forgiveness as well as the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio in the third quarter of included in the appendix is additional detail on our investment portfolio and asset liability positioning as chris mentioned we have intentionally positioned key to continue to benefit from higher interest rates over the next few years for example if we were to reprice our existing billion in shortterm treasuries and billion of swaps to todays interest rates we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of over billion this positions us to continue to grow net interest income and the net interest margin over each of the next few years even if rates do not increase moving to slide noninterest income was million for the third quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the second quarter our fee businesses continue to be impacted by the slowdown in capital markets investment banking and debt placement fees were million for the quarter up million from last quarter but down million yearoveryear compared to last year in addition to lower investment banking fees cards and payments income was million lower driven by lower prepaid card revenue which was partially offset by core growth consumer mortgage income was also lower reflecting lower gain on sale margins strength in the corporate services income from higher derivatives income partially offset these declines quarteroverquarter fees were down million trust and investment services income declined reflecting lower commercial brokerage commissions operating lease income was lower due to lease terminations in the quarter increases in cards and keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 payments income and the million increase in investment banking fees partially offset these declines despite the increase in other income this line also reflects a million reduction related to the ph visa litigation settlement this quarter we also reclassified certain customerrelated derivative income items from our other income line to corporate services income this change was reflected in the current period as well as reclassified in prior periods for comparability im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion relatively stable with last year and up million from last quarter our expenses reflect our ongoing investments in digital analytics and our teammates compared to the year ago quarter our expenses were down million we saw declines across most nonpersonnel line items including business services and professional fees higher personnel costs partially offset these declines related to an increase in salaries expense this increase included million of lower deferred costs from slower loan originations and million of higher contract labor related to technology initiatives compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense is up million higher personnel costs drove this increase this increase was caused by higher salaries related to seasonal staffing and million of lower deferred costs from slower loan originations in addition higher incentive and stockbased compensation was driven by a million increase related to the relative stock price change on incentive compensation partially offsetting these increases were declines across most nonpersonnel line items including occupancy and business services and professional fees now moving on to slide overall credit quality remains strong for the third quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of million from the prior quarter we did see a very slight increase in our to day delinquencies and criticized loans this quarter although both remain near historic lows our provision for credit losses was million for the quarter up from million in the second quarter and exceeding net chargeoffs by million the increase in the provision was driven by the change in the economic outlook now on to slide we ended the third quarter with a common equity tier ratio of within our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity continued to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders we will continue to manage our capital consistent with our capital priorities first supporting organic growth of our businesses second paying dividends and as weve mentioned before our board of directors will evaluate a dividend increase in the fourth quarter and third repurchasing shares during the quarter our board of directors approved an extension of our share repurchase authorization of million which is now in place through the third quarter of we did not complete any share repurchases in the current period as we have in prior years we have updated slide to show our fourth quarter outlook relative to our third quarter results using the midpoints of our guidance ranges would support chris comments about delivering another year keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 of positive operating leverage in we expect average loans will be up between and and average deposits up to net interest income is expected to be up between and reflecting growth in average loan balances and higher interest rates our guidance is based on the forward curve assuming a fed funds rate of by the end of noninterest income is expected to be up between and this reflects an expected seasonal pickup in investment banking and debt placement fees but we would expect the fourth quarter of to be well below the fourth quarter results this also accounts for the implementation of our new nsf odp structure which will decrease service charges on deposit accounts by approximately million this quarter the higher interest rate environment will also impact the earnings credit in our commercial businesses and is expected to further pressure this line item we expect noninterest expense to be up between and for the fourth quarter reflecting higher incentive compensation relative to fee production as well as million of onetime charges in the fourth quarter including a pension settlement charge which will flow through other expense over the quarter we expect credit quality to remain strong and net chargeoffs to be at the lower end of our to basis point range our guidance for the gaap tax rate remains the same at approximately finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was a solid quarter and we remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our commitments with that ill now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is from sic steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp you changed your name steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah so i want to start on the deposit side so if we look at the billion decline in the noninterest bearing right youre appropriately calling out the decline in nonoperating deposits if you look at the billion where you ended the quarter how much of that is still nonoperational and at risk to see outflows donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp i would say that at the end of the quarter when we look at our commercial balances its still in that range and we do believe that part of that decline to be honest is that we were a little stingy on some of our deposit rates and its part of our outlook for the fourth quarter of showing deposits increase we really have two factors one is seasonal changes and then also two is to use some of that deposit beta and maybe retain or attract additional customer relationships that are nonoperating steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful commentary don followup so if we look at the interestbearing deposit costs and only basis points in the three month tbill now at why arent deposits costs going to materially ramp in the quarters ahead for you guys or really for everybody i know that historically retail was sleepy right the money that move but its a different error today what gives you confidence that you could continue to see nim expansion which you clearly are signaling with the commentary on treasuries and swaps can you really flesh that out for us thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 so steve its chris a couple of things one when we were awash in liquidity we were pretty disciplined about how what deposits we kept and what deposits we pushed out so our starting point is a bit differentiated from where its been in other cycles the other thing to keep in mind is that or of our deposits are both consumer deposits and our escrow business which has significant deposits and weve been really focused on our pillars have been focused on four things one of which has been primacy for some time so i think were in a little bit different position than weve ever been in as the cycle changes what were seeing is that our cumulative beta is through the first three quarters we think our cumulative beta will be for the year were projecting an endpoint on a spot basis of just above so we are anticipating a fairly significant ramp but not the kind of experience that weve had before based on all the work we did prior to the rise in interest rates steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so is it safe to say most banks are guiding that nims are going to peak in the first half of next year and then trend down in the second half are you guys confident youll see nim expansion through thanks donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp well provide more in the outlook in january but youre right as we look at how were positioned with the benefit that chris and i both referred to as far as just the shortterm swaps and the shortterm treasuries and those rollovers that we do believe that were going to grow net interest income and margin even beyond that first half of and so even with this increased deposit beta and so that was intentional on our part to have more of a longterm focus as far as how we manage interest rate risk and we think that while its costing us a little bit on a relative basis now we think that well be recouping that throughout the later periods of and steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator next we go to the line of erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc you mentioned chris the billion benefit over time early on in your prepared remarks and don you mentioned it again so i guess let me ask the question number one your ci loan beta was this quarter is that essentially the impact from the swaps and should we expect a similar loan beta as the fed continues to raise rates and as we think about that billion benefit coming back how much of that is coming from the swap book versus the securities book and over what period of time do you realize that billion back into your net interest income donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure maybe i can go ahead and take a crack at that erika and i dont have it broken out for ci but for total commercial the swap impact for commercial yields cost us basis points on a linked quarter basis and so instead of the increase that youre seeing for commercial yields that just the actual loan itself would have translated to basis point increase and so i think thats going to be much more consistent with what you might be seeing for some others that dont have that hedge impact and so this quarter we did see that kind of relative change on that category as far as the impact from swaps as far as that billion that it really relates to the swap book and the maturities and also the shortterm treasuries those treasuries which total about billion really mature throughout late and throughout the swap book between now and the end of weve got billion of swap maturities and another billion in and so if we just look at that time period for the next two years and using that same math as far as repricing well have million of that billion annualized net income pickup occur in that two year time period christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp billion donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp of the billion im sorry yes the million out of the billion occur in that two year time period erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question is on expenses i think that key has always been very good at managing expenses particularly relative to fees and i think that it probably surprised the street in terms of the personnel costs relative to what happened on the fee side especially keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 and im wondering given that you called out some of the million and the million in your slides how should we think about the million going forward and i guess my other question and im sorry im not getting this out quickly is is this just something that even though the capital markets remain dislocated inflation and the competition for talent will continue to push this pressure this upward donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp a couple of things one our expenses were higher than what we had guided to for this quarter and for the second half of the year if you look at the components of what drove that change and ill get to your question as part of this is that there are three items that really caused our outlook for all of to be higher than what we previously expected one is more onetime items weve got a pension settlement loss projected in the fourth quarter and also some branch consolidation not branch our building consolidation type of costs associated with that and those two combined to million outside of personnel but within our operating losses during the second quarter we were seeing our operating losses from the prepaid card product come down through the second quarter and we expected that to continue through the third and fourth quarter and what we actually saw was those costs actually go up and so it wasnt a huge increase but compared to what our relative positioning was and the expectation was for that category its about a million increase for the second half of the year expense structure for us and the good thing about that is is that we have taken action to address that and well start to see that over time but the other good thing is it has a limited life to it these are related to funds that were distributed as part of the stimulus programs and theyre winding down and so we dont think that will have an ongoing impact with us the third component erika really is deferred loan origination costs and that cost us about million and most of that is with our reset of our consumer loan originations and the cost that gets deferred associated with that and so we will see increases from that continue for some time period erika were not seeing a return of the previous origination levels so that will be there for the fourth quarter we expect to see our capital markets revenues pick up and as weve said before the incentive compensation expense tend to be correlated to the tune of about on the dollar so for every dollar of investment banking and debt placement fee increase we will see that come through incentives as far as where we see for other salary and personnel costs that i would say just looking at the yearoveryear adjusting for some of these items i talked about for the deferred loan origination costs and things our total salary dollars were up about and head count is up about now some of that includes some of the smaller acquisitions weve done throughout the year and so that does imply a to inflationary impact for some of the salaries some of that is because of the lower end of the pay scale continue to have increases some of its market pressure and well be working through that as we said our expectation for merit increases for and beyond and i think that the important thing here erika also is that were very focused on driving positive operating leverage we expect to do that this year and we havent given guidance for or beyond yet but we expect to continue that through the next several years as well keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator next we go to john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc related to your last comment there on the operating leverage i mean your cash efficiency ratio is running at about yeartodate and just wondering how if you could help us think how youre thinking about that for and if not maybe if you could help us with the magnitude of pos op leverage that we could see in and then separately your longterm target you maintain that at to how should we think about what you need to see to be able to achieve that level thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp john its chris good morning so i think our efficiency ratio for the quarter we just printed was right around its not we do aspire to get to to but as don mentioned what were really focused on is positive operating leverage and if you think about our capital markets business coming back if you think about some of the many investments that we continue to make coming to fruition and you think about the trajectory that don described from an nii perspective obviously that continues to move us toward that longterm target that you referenced of to john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thanks chris and then separately in terms of deposit growth expectations i appreciate the color you gave nearterm i wanted to just get a little bit of color on how you think about deposit growth as you look into maybe if you could talk about the mix shift of noninterest bearing towards interestbearing and then overall growth levels do you think incremental declines are possible as we look into the early part of thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 well i mean were really kind of going into a bit of uncharted territory i will tell you this though we have been pretty consistent and that our noninterest bearing have been right around and that hasnt moved and i dont anticipate that moving a lot as we go forward and as i mentioned earlier this deposit book has been pretty well scrubbed over a period of time having said all that as interest rates continue to rise some deposits that previously were deemed to be not interest rate sensitive will in fact be interest rate sensitive and we saw some of that movement in the third quarter where some of our public sector customers that are more interest rate sensitive moved so were obviously watching it very closely and its certainly an interesting dynamic particularly as the fed unwinds their balance sheet concurrently john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator next we go to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning chris good morning don christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris you talked about the strength in the commercial and industrial loan growth and youve taken on more of originations than you have in the past as more of your customers are coming on to your balance sheet rather than going to the capital markets a couple of questions one can you share with us what percentage of that portfolio is considered leveraged loans and then also in that same kind of vein how big is your syndicated loan portfolio and did that impact the growth this quarter christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp so a couple of things our leverage book gerard has been pretty consistent at about of total loans and whats interesting about that is its been even when we were a much smaller company so that portfolio has a lot of velocity its in our its in the segments in which we focus theres been some talk about some of the deals that are hung lately weve just had just a de minimis mark over the last six months in that book so we feel really really good about that keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 most of the growth that youre seeing conversely is really an investment grade credit and the market was dislocated enough and our clients were trying to do things in an expeditious manner and we have really grown the percentage of our ci book thats investment grade as we brought more onto the balance sheet right now our ci book is about investment grade which is a bit of an outlier for a bank of our size gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and when you underwrite the new originations do you guys i assume you always do this but are you stressing in for or basis points higher rates just so that youre protected if rates are to go quite a bit higher from here christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp for sure i mean our first stress that we always run is actually basis points and we run a lot of stress other stresses and when you get into anything thats leveraged we stress ebitda and we stress interest rates because thats the danger of anything thats leveraged as you have the concurrent decline of ebitda and the increase in borrowing costs and we do a lot of stressing with respect to those credits gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question your credit quality obviously is superb like many of your peers and i know thats going to be a defining moment for you folks through the cycle so the question i have is on the consumer loan portfolio with the fico scores i think you showed it averages out to have you guys theres been some chatter that fico scores like i think college grades have been inflated are you guys seeing anything where are these fico scores if you compare them to five years ago they are inflated or is that really not the case christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp i havent personally done the analysis but just because we look at this stuff all the time i think theres probably a lot of like they teach the sap i think theres some instruction on how to get your fico score up having said that if you think about the super prime customers that were focused on doctors dentists which for example were of our mortgage originations last quarter we feel really really good about our consumer book as we look kind of across all the metrics donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp and gerard youre right there actually was some technical change in some of the fico scores and i dont know if it was by law or what but they had to exclude certain i think medicalrelated costs or loans or expenses and so if you would adjust for that i think that todays fico score is probably to basis points higher than the same would be several years ago and so instead of our it might be a which is still super prime even on historic standards keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you don thank you chris donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thanks gerard operator next we go to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess don just wanted to follow up on the swap and the treasury securities portfolio so get in terms of how this should help nii thats obviously assuming that rates stay high for the next to months is there anything that you plan to do ahead of time to lock in that upside or just give us a sense of because what i worry is if we get to the next three to six months rates lower do we start losing some of that benefit that you would have otherwise had and is there a way that you expect to lock that in ahead of time donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp were continuing to review that on a regular basis i would say that our alco committee as we get together we tend to think that were going to see rates higher for longer just given what weve experienced in the current marketplace but even with that youve seen a little bit of a tick up again as far as our forward starting swaps and thats exactly the purpose of that ebrahim is that were looking to put on swaps that actually kick in as some of these will mature and start to lock in some of that forward benefit for us as well and were not ready to do a wholesale type of repositioning to achieve that but we do expect to continue to use that tool over the next several quarters to help lock in some of that benefit ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 thats fair and i guess just on a separate question following up on credit less to do with your portfolio which you have a lens into sort of the middle market commercial cre like how stressed do you expect that customer base are you seeing areas where youve kind of pulled back given the rapid rise in fed interest rates and what were seeing in the markets in terms of spread widening like what are the areas where youre seeing pain where you pulled back as a bank and where do you like do you actually start seeing a fed funds as more certainly creating pressure for a subset of that segment christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure ill take that one clearly i mean last year and our view for some time has been that these work that inflation would be persistent and that rates would have to be higher for longer and if you go back to a year ago in september when we exited indirect auto billion portfolio that was an area that we thought and i still believe well be under intense stress in the market that were entering the other thing that i always look for is any place that theres leverage and gerard cassidy had just asked a question about leverage loans thats an area that we pay a lot of attention to another area that we pay a lot of attention to is just real estate broadly and by strategy were focused on apartments multifamily and industrial interestingly those values were up significantly from prepandemic levels and respectively the other area where i think that theres going to be a lot of dislocation is in office particularly b and c class office because those buildings are leveraged and obviously people have changed the way they work thats not a business that were in in any significant way although we do have a billion thirdparty commercial loan servicing portfolio which is debt thats off us and now the second largest category below retail where you would expect thats starting to go into active special servicing are these b and c class offices in central business districts those are a few of the places that id bring to your attention ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just on the office do you think its a cliff event just given the nature of the leases or is it going to be more like what weve seen with big box retail malls where its played out over the last decade as opposed to in any given quarter or any given year christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp yeah i dont think its a cliff event i think its a slow burn because if you think about these b and c class office space they have many many tenants with varying termination dates on their leases i think it will be a slow but consistent burn ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 operator next we go to the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking my question maybe chris i was hoping you could sort of walk through the investment banking pipelines and pullthrough i think we can all see whats happening in the industry but some companies are noting that theres still enough activity taking place at sort of the smaller segment middle market and below that its keeping sort of activity going enough to prop up numbers so where are you seeing healthier activity versus whats still slow and just given your background do you think theres a point where we will say get price discovery and then increased activity despite higher rates and a weaker economic backdrop christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp so i do so where the activity has remained strong and we had a very good quarter in this area it is areas like syndicated finance so that area continues to be strong the areas that are really challenged are is the public equity market and thats a market unlike the debt market where its binary either you can issue equity or you cant basically and right now you clearly cant the ma markets im confident will come back we are involved in a lot of these strategic discussions and whats happening scott is if youre a buyer you basically have sort of a free option theres no huge impetus to close everyone is looking out over the horizon and predicting a downturn and so if you have a deal locked up you sort of drag your feet and wait and see what the downturn is going to look like our pipelines remain strong in that business we continue to selectively hire people it will come back i dont think its going to come back i dont see any significant market change in the fourth quarter by the way but i do think the business will come back having said that ive been doing this for a long time theres an inverse relationship between the amount of time youve been working on the deal and the probability that its actually going to close and so i throw that out as a watch point r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thats good color thank you and then maybe don this notion of aoci marks and the tangible book and tce hits has gotten a lot more attention a lot of companies have begun to move pretty substantial amounts of their securities portfolios to held to maturity so in a sense you can sort of make the tce tangible book issue go away with the wave of hand so to speak so maybe just some thoughts on why you guys are keeping mostly available for sale to what degree does tce matter in your eyes does it govern any of your capital management thinking or things like that keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure that as we look at our future security purchases were starting to put a portion of those into held to maturity whereas it used to be primarily only into the available for sale and so were just separating some where we might want to have bullet maturities where we can do some end of life type of swaps attached to it that we need to keep those and available for sale as opposed to move them into held to maturity the tce ratio isnt a high priority for us our main capital ratio that we focus on is the common equity tier ratio and some of the other regulatory ratios whether its tier or total and so thats why you saw us take action in the third quarter with a preferred stock issuance and also a sub debt issuance and we feel very good about how were positioned across that capital spectrum the other thing to think about too as far as the tce ratio if you would just back out the aoci impact for tce that would take our ratio up by basis points and so on that adjusted basis which will all come back over time because we dont have risk of those investments not being paid off because theyre all agencies or us treasuries were going to see that realized and so thats more of the area of focus for us as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you guys for taking the questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp thank you operator next we go to the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning just wondering what youre seeing in loan pricing trends specifically in commercial obviously the absolute yield is going up because of higher rates but are you seeing any improvement in spreads given we see widening in the marketplace in public markets that is donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thats a great question matt and whats ironic about this is todate what weve seen is credit spreads widen out for the investment grade companies that we serve and because theyre seeing that in the capital markets for the middle market space because of the competition there tends to be more local we havent seen the commercial spreads widen that much yet we would expect that to pick up over time here but near term the spreads are holding in but not expanding on the commercial for the lower middle market customers matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 any way to quantify on the investment grade as you mentioned your overweight investment grade versus others so thats probably a positive for you donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp well it is for us and i would say that on the credit spread widening weve probably seen a good basis points of widening generally on pricing reflective of credit spreads in the market matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator next we have a question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi ive one negative one positive the negative is the personnel expense up so much quartertoquarter and i get onetime items just versus its just how the onetime items seem to repeat and therefore maybe they arent so onetime i mean i guess you said fourth quarter you might have some more next year do you expect more onetime items or when do we get more core expense numbers because that seemed to come in a little higher than expected and on the positive side as far as your outlook for nii and the nim i mean your nim of a decade ago it was close to conceptually weve had almost years of zero interest rates and now that were getting out of that could you potentially get all the way back to or what are some of the ins and outs since the global financial crisis that could help or hurt that donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure as far as personnel a couple of things that weve talked about as being onetime or just different one is the pension settlement loss that well have in the fourth quarter the good thing there is is that with rates being higher the threshold is higher for us to be in a position to have to realize losses in the future and so we do think this truly is more onetime and as long as rates remain where theyre at or even go a little higher we shouldnt see that come through as far as a charge the one thing that you will see mike is that a good portion of our longterm incentive compensation is tied to our stock price and we want our employees to be shareholders and have a consistent objective to what our shareholders have as well and so part of that incentive compensation expense does fluctuate from timetotime with our share price and so our expectation and hope is that well see our share price increase and so from that you will see the incentive compensation expense increase with that as well beyond that mike that i would say for the current quarter versus a year ago as i mentioned before the core salary line item is up about with about of that coming from head countrelated increases some of that from acquisitions weve done and we had about a kind of merit increase impact to that as well throughout the year and that reflects some of the experience we had for rightsizing the lower salaries but also keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 the market pressure that were seeing and so nearterm i think well probably see a little higher than our typical as far as wage inflation going forward but i think well see that settle down and as chris has said that well continue to make investments in talent and especially in our frontline bankers and also in the technology space to continue to grow our business but with that well be holding the people account while theyre making sure that were getting the appropriate returns on those investments and showing the growth going forward christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp yeah don the only thing i would add to that is on the technology front there has been a transition as we think about full stack engineers from subcontract labor to people that are part of our head count we just think its important as we continue to become the digital bank that we are that we control that talent and so thats a piece of what youre seeing there mike donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah and then mike as far as the margin expansion i dont want people to start thinking that were going to be at a margin because our risk profile is much different than what it was historically and so it is relationship based but we do see significant growth from that and so one and just a simple math for that would be taking a look at our full year net interest income and if you just layered on top of that the billion that weve talked about the repricing of the swaps and the treasuries that clearly gets you into the mid and maybe not to the range but we would see some meaningful lift from here if the rates play out with this kind of environment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just one followup on that comment about technology so less consultants and more fulltime tech employees so that you can better control your tech destiny is that the idea of this and what was the tipping point for that change christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp the tipping point was as we were in the pandemic and everybody was short on talent we were getting more turnover from some of our contractors than frankly we wanted to get and we wanted to be able to literally have the continuity and we wanted to drive our strategy in a consistent way with leadership and so we made the decision in certain areas to dial back contract labor and to hire in when i say its full stack engineers and the nice thing is with some of the acquisitions weve made mike we have the kind of leaders that can attract the kind of people onto our platform that we want as we go to the next level mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp thank you donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator and our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks a lot good morning don just one more followup on the balance sheet mix so the securities portfolio has been hanging around billion and just want to understand with that plan run off in that good slide you have in the back about the maturities do you expect to keep the securities portfolio around this size from here and then just on trying to understand how that that gets funded incrementally given that youre still expecting decent loan growth donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah theres really two pieces of our investment portfolio one is the core book which is about billion and the other is the us treasuries which are about billion i think nearterm and our outlook would suggest that we think that core portfolio will hang in there around the billion level and so we think thats appropriate just from a liquidity perspective and a balance sheet mix for the us treasury portion of the portfolio well make some assessments as that maturities or those maturities come through and well get the benefit whether we use that for future funding or we just go ahead and roll that into the core portfolio and so yet to be determined how that plays out but i would say that theres probably less certainty on that billion shortterm treasury portfolio ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and just following on to that then so the billion benefit would does that in contemplate like any type of delta in sizing of both the securities book and the overall swaps book as you get to those out years donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp the swap book assumes that it would stay the same and then on the treasury portfolio it has either the assumed impact of rolling that over into more one year treasuries or using that for funding and its the same net bottom line impact at this point in time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just sorry one more followup just do you have an understanding or can you help us understand just when the nearterm swaps detriment just from the natural higher rates kind of gets to its bottom keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 and then you start to get this that incremental benefit rate of change starts to happen i guess it sounds like thats in next year but do you have an understanding of kind of when that pivot happens donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp i would say that a couple of things we have to know for that when do shortterm rates peak because thats going to be the main driver as to when that negative impact happens for the existing portfolio and then as we have the rollovers of that book well be picking up over basis points on the swaps as they would rollover and so that will help offset that but it probably sometime in that we start to see that peak and move the other direction ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks don donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator and our next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp good morning donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions one i just wanted to understand what kind of loan growth youve got baked into your outlook and what is your expectation for how youre going to fund that loan growth christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp so what we on the loan growth front we would not see the same trajectory of loan growth that weve experienced in the last couple of quarters our guidance for q4 is to betsy and weve had a lot of lift on the consumer side over the last several quarters i dont see the same level of lift that so i think youre going to see we havent given guidance yet for but with respect to loan growth were targeting to in the fourth quarter keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp and just to fund that our guidance for the fourth quarter is also to increase in our deposits and if you go through the math its a pretty close match there as far as the midpoints of both are around that billion kind of range and so its we think well be fairly close to funding that through just the core balance sheet growth we have used other wholesale funding to help fill that gap in the last couple of quarters but expect it to be more core going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and if the deposits dont come through for whatever reason can you just give us your hierarchy of how you would go about funding it is it securities roll off or you first go to the wholesale funding piece donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp nearterm weve been using fhlb advances and locking those into set maturities or term maturities so we would probably continue that and then as i mentioned before were still yet undecided as far as the roll off of the us treasuries when they start coming through next year and then is to how we use those proceeds betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just lastly i know the forward curve is looking for the fed to be done in early but if they end up extending with the rate hike cycle going further into how should we expect that impacts the outlook here i know you mentioned that youve got the benefit of the shortterm of the swaps rolling off which should help but im just wondering is there any timing that we should be considering here donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah i dont think theres any cliff or any events there that we still view the rates going up well still have a net positive even with deposit betas being higher than what theyve been before and then just the repricing of the swaps and the treasuries will be additive for us and so we think that we still will be able to grow net interest income and margin throughout the next couple of years even if rates do go beyond the current outlook betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just last question going back to the quarter in mortgage for the quarter very strong results here with i just wanted to understand what the main driver of that was and the tail the legs on that type of increase thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp sure so for us it was driven really by the purchase of our originations were purchased and this is a relationshipbased business were medical professionals so ours will basically refinance business betsy keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 has completely dried up i would envision from here that purchased mortgage continues to decline in this environment as we believe were in for a cycle thats higher for longer betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so this is reflecting loans that had probably started a quarter or two ago so we should expect that should tail off and are these 30year fixed youre putting on or 15year or arm floaters can you give us a sense of the construct donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp it tends to be more arms in year we do have some 30year fixed in some of our doctor dentist program that weve had but id say its a mix of those and we would expect to see the fourth quarter origination levels be lower than what the third quarter was it still is a core product for us and something that we had underweighted in the past so we still think there is room for some modest growth in the balance sheet there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator and our final question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning chris and don christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president director keycorp hi bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc i wanted to follow up on your comments around the modest increase in the reserve rate due to the economic outlook can you give a little bit more detail on what kind of unemployment assumption is implicit in that reserve and what youd expect the reserve rate to go to if unemployment were to increase to say the to range donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah as far as what we use as our baseline for our cecl reserves we tend to start with the consensus assessments for moodys and so we did see a shift in that from last year to this year i would say that moodys unemployment levels are using about a unemployment level for and i dont know that off the top of my keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 head what the impact would be of seeing that going to because wed have to have the other components of the economic outlook but i would say that if we look at where our reserves were back at january i would say that the unemployment levels and economic outlook was a little worse than what were seeing now today and our reserve levels there were about or basis points higher than what they are today for us so its a lot of moving parts and pieces but i think that its not going to be a huge change but still would be reflective in our reserves bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and separately it seems intuitive that the cohort that youre targeting with your laurel road products would perform relatively well in a downturn but is there less credit history for this asset class and if so can you give a little bit of color on the kind of data and analytics that youre using to underwrite potential customers and whats the approval rate of customers seeking a loan through laurel road and actually those that actually receive one donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp i would say that we do have data for doctors and dentists programs both on the residential mortgage side and also for student loans that history is continuing to be built out we are using that insight in order to inform our credit underwriting decision i dont have the exact approval rate for loans but you would probably assume that its fairly high given the nature of the doctor that were approaching who is going from say a year in compensation to 300000plus and has a firm commitment and a new assignment with a large hospital so its i would assume that it could be a fairly high approval rate bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thank you operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today thank you for your participation and for
