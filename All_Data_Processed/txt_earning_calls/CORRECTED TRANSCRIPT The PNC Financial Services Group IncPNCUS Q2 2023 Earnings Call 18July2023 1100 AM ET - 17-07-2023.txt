delivered solid results in the second quarter generating exactly billion in net income or in diluted earnings per share while the macro environment and the competitive dynamics playing out within the banking sector pressured our revenue the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 during the quarter our results reflect the overall strength of our franchise and balance sheet and importantly through it all we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities our momentum across our markets remained strong especially in the southwest we are growing households and commercial customers throughout our footprint rob will take you through the details of our second quarter results in a moment but id like to call out a few highlights first we grew our capital during the quarter and feel very good about our positioning of our balance sheet in the current environment in the next few weeks we expect the fed will announce changes to the basel iii capital framework we believe our strong capital and liquidity levels as well as our earnings power provide the strength and flexibility to address upcoming regulatory changes at the same time we continue to support our customers grow our business and deliver returns for our shareholders and in line with our focus on shareholder returns we recently increased our quarterly common stock dividend by our financial strength and stability are evidenced in the feds latest stress tests resulting in an improvement in our stress capital buffer to the regulatory minimum level of in october second expense control is in focus rob will touch on this in a moment we have increased our continuous improvement program target for and are taking a hard look at opportunities for even further expense improvements across the franchise third credit quality for the quarter remained strong reflecting our diversified lending franchise and our focus on developing valuable sustainable businesses based on longterm customer relationships and finally id like to thank our employees for their efforts and contributions during the quarter and with that ill turn it over to rob robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and were presenting on an average basis and comparing to the first quarter loans were stable at billion investment securities declined billion or cash balances at the federal reserve were billion and decreased billion deposits of billion declined billion or borrowed funds increased billion as an aside since weve been deliberate in issuing tlaccompliant debt so were confident well meet the upcoming tlac requirements through our normal course of funding at quarter end aoci was a negative billion and tangible book value was per common share an increase of compared to the same period a year ago we remain well capitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of as of june which increased basis points linked quarter we returned approximately million of capital to shareholders in the quarter which included million of common dividends and approximately million of share repurchases or million shares and as bill just mentioned our board recently approved a increase to our quarterly cash dividend on common stock raising the dividend to per share our recent ccar results underscore the strength of our balance sheet and as previously announced our current stress capital buffer of will improve to the regulatory minimum of for the fourquarter period beginning in october due to the expected issuance by the federal banking agencies of proposed rules to adjust the basel iii capital framework share repurchase the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 activity in the third quarter is expected to remain modest we will continue to monitor this and may adjust share repurchase activity as appropriate slide shows our loans in more detail second quarter loans averaged billion and increased billion or compared to the same period a year ago this growth reflected strong loan demand during the back half of and our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our expanded franchise average loan balances were stable linked quarter as growth in consumer was offset by a decline in commercial with commercial balances reflecting generally weaker demand consumer loans grew million compared to the first quarter reflecting higher residential mortgage credit card and auto balances commercial loans averaged billion in the second quarter a decline of billion as limited new production was more than offset by paydowns loan yields increased basis points to in the second quarter predominantly driven by the higher rate environment slide covers our deposits in more detail deposits declined on both a spot and average basis linked quarter reflecting the continuing pressure of quantitative tightening and increased spending activity as well as consumer tax payments deposits continue to move from noninterestbearing to interestbearing accounts as expected the mix shift is being driven by commercial deposits in the second quarter commercial noninterestbearing deposits represented of total commercial deposits compared to in the first quarter our consumer deposit noninterestbearing mix has been stable remaining at on a consolidated basis our level of noninterestbearing deposits was in the second quarter down slightly from in the first quarter consistent with our expectations and we still expect the noninterestbearing portion of our deposits to stabilize in the mid20 range our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to during the second quarter up from in the prior quarter and as of june our cumulative deposit beta was looking forward we expect the federal reserve to raise the benchmark rate by basis points in july we believe this will put additional pressure on betas and as a result we expect our third quarter and yearend cumulative betas to be and respectively slide details our investment securities and swap portfolios average investment securities of billion decreased billion or as limited purchase activity during the quarter was more than offset by portfolio paydowns and maturities the securities portfolio yield increased basis points to reflecting the runoff of loweryielding securities and as of june the duration of the investment securities portfolio was years our receivefixed swaps pointing to the commercial loan book totaled billion at the end of the second quarter the weighted average receive fixed rate of our swap portfolio increased basis points linked quarter to and the portfolio duration was years as of june during the second quarter our accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by million paydowns and maturities were in line with our expectations but were more than offset by the negative impact from higher than expected rates throughout the quarter the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 notwithstanding this aoci impact our tangible book value increased to compared to march importantly as lower rate securities and swaps roll off we expect our securities yields to continue to increase resulting in a meaningful improvement to tangible book value from aoci accretion turning to the income statement on slide for the first half of revenue grew compared to the same period a year ago reflecting higher interest rates and overall business growth noninterest expense grew and was well controlled despite a higher fdic assessment rate and inflationary pressures as a result ppnr grew for the second quarter net income was billion or per share total revenue of billion decreased million or compared to the first quarter of net interest income declined million or and our net interest margin was a decline of basis points noninterest income declined million or driven by both lower fee income and other noninterest income which included visa fair value adjustments of a negative million that i will discuss in a moment second quarter expenses increased million or linked quarter provision was million in the second quarter reflecting portfolio activity and changes in macroeconomic variables and our effective tax rate was which included the favorable impact of certain tax matters in the second quarter turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends second quarter revenue was down million or compared with the first quarter net interest income of billion decreased million or with higher yields on interestearning assets were more than offset by increased funding costs and lower loan and securities balances fee income was billion and decreased million or linked quarter the primary driver of the decline in fee income was residential and commercial mortgage revenue which was down million inside of that million was related to lower net valuation of mortgage servicing rights beyond that capital markets and advisory revenue decreased million or driven by lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and loan syndication revenue going forward we expect this activity to meaningfully increase in the second half of the year which is included in our guidance that i will cover in a few minutes partially offsetting these declines was a million or increase in card and cash management fees reflecting seasonally higher consumer transaction volumes and increased treasury management product revenue other noninterest income of million declined linked quarter driven by lower private equity revenue and included negative visa fair value adjustments related to litigation escrow funding and other valuation changes totaling million turning to slide our second quarter expenses were up million or linked quarter and remain well controlled the growth was primarily due to a million increase in marketing expense reflecting seasonality personnel expense increased by million or which included the full quarter impact of annual employee merit increases every other expense category remained stable or declined compared to the first quarter of as bill mentioned we remain diligent in our expense management efforts particularly when considering the current revenue environment at the beginning of the year we set a continuous improvement program goal of million recently weve identified initiatives that support increasing our cip by an additional million raising our full year target to million the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 further well continue to look for additional efficiencies during the remainder of and importantly as we begin to plan for our credit metrics are presented on slide our credit quality remains strong and notably the leading indicators for credit quality continue to perform well nonperforming loans were down million or and continue to represent less than of total loans and total delinquencies of billion decreased million or linked quarter net chargeoffs of million were stable linked quarter our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans ratio was basis points in the second quarter and our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of total loans on june essentially stable with march while overall credit quality remains strong across our portfolio the office category within commercial real estate continues to be a key area of concern as expected we saw increases in chargeoffs related to office during the quarter however the portfolio metrics remain largely similar to those presented in our comprehensive view last quarter naturally well continue to monitor and review our assumptions to ensure they reflect realtime market conditions and a full update is included in the appendix slides in summary pnc reported a solid second quarter in regard to our view of the overall economy were expecting a mild recession starting in early with a contraction in real gdp of less than our rate path assumption includes a 25basispoint increase in the fed funds rate in july following that we expect the fed to pause rate actions until march when we expect the fed to begin to cut rates looking ahead our outlook for the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of is as follows we expect average loans to decline approximately net interest income to be down to noninterest income to be up to taking the component pieces we expect total revenue to be up approximately we expect total noninterest expense to be stable and we expect second quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million considering our reported operating results for the first half of third quarter expectations and current economic forecasts for the full year compared to full year we expect spot loans to be relatively stable which equates to average loan growth of to total revenue growth to be approximately to inside of that our expectation is for net interest income to be in the range of up to this is a move to the lower end of our previous guidance largely driven by anticipated deposit costs moving a bit faster than we expected and slightly lower loan growth expectations we expect noninterest income to decline to which is down from our earlier expectations of stable this change is resulting from softer than expected capital markets revenue in the second quarter and million of visa related charges that have been incurred yeartodate expenses are expected to be up approximately credit quality is trending better than expected and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is coming from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the fee income side if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit on your change in your expectation to down to for the year i know it represents a change in your view on capital markets as well as the impact of visa but i know you indicated you expect a meaningful increase in capital markets in the back half so maybe if you could kind of talk about whats impacting that and maybe help size it up a bit thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure john this is rob so in regard to our total noninterest income guidance for the full year we did change it from stable to down to most of that in terms of that decline has occurred so its really reflective of what occurred in the second quarter in regard to capital market fees underperforming our expectations and the visa charge that we talked about which is not in fees but is in other noninterest income going forward we do expect to pick up in capital markets fees and thats in our guidance both for the third quarter and the balance of the year just to give you some more color around that we expect capital markets to get back to in the third quarter the first quarter levels run rate that we were at and then some meaningful growth on top of that as well and thats all in our guidance so in short order the decline in the guidance has already occurred and weve blended that into the full year john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thats helpful and then separately on the capital return side i know you indicated that you expect buybacks trending somewhat minimal so just pending basel iii ph is that leaning in perhaps in that million range or is there another way to think about that and then separately maybe bill if you can talk about any thought around ma appetite both on the nonbank side and the bank side thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc i can handle the first one there i guess in terms of the capital and then bill you can talk about some of the changes the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 yeah no surprise there we feel good about our capital levels our cet capital ratio increased basis points in the quarter so were at we did well on the stress test the most recent stress test where our stress capital buffer decreased so were in an excess capital position the part of that thinking was the increase in the dividend that we announced recently as far as share repurchases like i said its not a surprise were on pause its sensible to see what these new rules mean understand the details and then build that into our capital return plan so were positioned for share repurchases going forward but its just sensible to take a pause right now william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think on the ma side we continue to look as we have done for the last several years its small things that might augment our client offerings the volume of things that are being shown to us has actually probably increased our appetite to do them has probably decreased a little bit at the margin larger things are going to be kind of a function of the environment and what the regulatory landscape looks like but all else equal we would be interested in expanding our franchise john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for taking the questions william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is coming from the line of dave george with baird please go ahead david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc hey good morning guys kind of a big picture question for both bill and rob i wanted to get a sense as to how youre thinking about managing the balance sheet today given where the cost of new money is relative to a year ago with loans and securities down a bit i would guess economics and perhaps some capital relief are driving some of that but im curious as to how youre thinking about balancing spread revenue growth relative to managing the balance sheet for returns i assume youre continuing to run the bank at the same roe targets you always have but im curious conceptually guys how youre thinking about that dynamic thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think at the 10000foot level our appetite to lend and support our clients isnt affected by shortterm funding costs and so forth theres youre seeing somewhat tepid loan growth largely because theres tepid loan demand i think as a practical matter theres a backlog building a lot of our clients have been hesitant to do refinance under some hope that spreads would come back down i dont think thats going to happen so i think youll see activity towards the back half of the year but in any event we just we support clients we dont manage the balance sheet and the clients get the result and see other way the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 with respect to interest rates we are as neutral as we can otherwise be and i think what youre going to see through time as deposits move back towards historical norms in terms of noninterestbearing moving to interest bearing and we reached that kind of cumulative beta thats going to be offset by swaps and securities fixed rate assets rolling off and repricing and thats kind of what we target as we run the balance sheet in a neutral position right now david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc okay appreciate robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc id just add to that is so we ran for many years substantially asset sensitive and thats changed so were slightly asset sensitive but really neutral right now david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc perfect operator our next question is coming from the line of erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i guess the first question here and i just want to emphasize this and this squares with your 10q disclosure you mentioned a neutrally positioned balance sheet so as we think about that exit run rate that is implied for your guidance on net interest income of about billion for the fourth quarter of without taking into account balance sheet growth it sounds like if we do get the rate cuts that the market is expecting that the youre going to be able to stay within that range of billion billion again excluding any assumed growth robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats fair thats fair of course our own plans are as i mentioned in our opening comments that we wouldnt see rate cuts until first quarter of next year but youre in the right neighborhood erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and thank you so much for all the disclosure on slide im wondering when do you think is the time to start thinking about adding and protecting from that downside risk with regards to maybe adding new receivefixed swaps at obviously a higher floor than where theyre coming off of and whats the pricing like for those securities for those swaps rather the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc again we are at the moment basically neutral to rates so a duration of equity thats been bouncing around plus or minus half a year so adding in this environment would be choosing to get long choosing to get long would basically be saying that we think the forward curve is correctively like term rates and im not sure we do that that we agree with that yet which is why youve seen security balances roll down i think the big unknown for us and everybody is if and when the fed pauses and then cuts rates what actually happens to the shape of the yield curve in term rates and expectations would be youd see a massive flattening so im not sure at the moment that theres value to be had in extending duration to the extent we do were doing it in the very short ph end youd in fact see that in our swaps book while balances are down we canceled some and put some other ones on indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc higher yields william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the yield but very short dated erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator operator instruction our next question is coming from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you for taking the question i just wanted to ask sort of a conceptual question on deposit pricing the pressures seem i guess a little bit uneven by company i was hoping you could spend a moment discussion sort of how you think about the balance between not necessarily needing to show liquidity the way some others do but still being bound just naturally by competitive dynamics within the footprint william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure i followed the question i mean the basic our deposit outflows i guess maybe ill answer it this way are largely following the expectations i think youd see across the industry with qt the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc inside of that we try to keep our client base and price them competitively and youre seeing that in the mix shift from noninterestbearing to interestbearing and the increase in the beta were not out chasing trying to do broker deposits or big cd pushes or something to boost deposits if thats kind of where your question was going robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc but mostly protecting scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah no robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc our core consumer customer and commercial customer scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah no i mean you hit on it i guess i probably could have worded it better but if i look at your cume beta assumption its lower than some others but seems sort of realistic also just within the sort of confines of what youre actually experiencing so i was just curious about how the competitive dynamic sort of weighed in there and i think you touched on it so i appreciate that then william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think if your base flows were higher than what was otherwise happening because of qts in other words you were losing deposits at a pace in that instance your replacement cost is full rate robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and i think youre going to see that play out as earnings come out this week where youre going to see some pretty extreme differences in whats happened to funding cost scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but our flows have been largely kind of following qt trend robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc maybe a little better william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you and i was hoping we could peel back a little more into the sort of the expected capital markets recovery william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i guess as i look at it from a top level if there are sort of three big chunks in the capital markets dcm seems like its sort of fine ecm maybe has found firmer footing but ma is the piece thats still sort of in a logjam i guess maybe as you think about the nuance for that recovery in the back half of the year just what are the main drivers that you see robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure scott this is rob yeah particularly for us the ma piece harris williams is a high percentage of our capital market fees were going off of pipeline so the pipeline in our advisory businesses and largely extrapolate that the capital markets in total is up over the first quarter and yearoveryear and as you know they had a pretty good second half of so were basing it on that scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you all very much robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 operator our next question is coming from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey mike robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i thought you might push a little harder on this so your revised guidance using midpoints is for nii to be basis points less fees to be basis points less and expenses only basis points less so im just wondering how much harder you might push on the expenses you did mention the cip going from million to million of savings this year so i guess that helps but are you preserving infrastructure and resources for potential growth is it just not that variable or what else can you do to get expenses more in sync with the revised lower revenue guidance and i mean thats all recognized and i think youre still guiding for positive operating leverage this year its just not as high as it once was william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thanks for the question mike the short answer is we are going to push harder on it the practical answer is im not entirely sure that the benefits of what we will be doing will show up in the run rate in if you look at our costs right were basically down in every category other than personnel and were going to have to take a hard look at where we can generate savings in this company without cutting the potential for growth and the opportunity we continue to see in our growth markets and just business activity but were going to look at that really hard im just not sure it shows up in robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc just in terms of the timing because theres only six months left so actions that you take dont show up in that run rate but we did reduce as you pointed out we did reduce the expectation to up yearoveryear that includes the fdic special assessment that was in there and obviously inflationary pressure so thats pretty good but were not going to stop there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right well one followup then as we how does this set you up for i guess is it too early to say and just in general you guys have been you and the industry its been about six to nine months of negative the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 downward guidance it was loan spreads for you guys one quarter it was higher interest rates in others capital markets a little bit this quarter and these are factors outside of your control at least those are do you think youre levelsetting enough now are we there or theres still more risk to the downside than to the upside william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc seems so far away at the moment but i think i guess what i would say is were running the company for the long term here we see we continue to see once we get through rate normalization tremendous upside in the company in growth through clients in our new markets and are we at the trough now are we at the trough with our guidance for the fourth quarter i dont know i dont know if you have a view on it rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well i no i would say you sort of talked about it i mean the disruption has been largely driven by the rate environment and the volatility in the rate environment that not only affects our earning assets and our deposits but also some of our interest ratesensitive fees so all the changes there are a function of the extraordinary change in the rates are we in the later innings of that i think probably but hard to be accurate exactly mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator our next question is coming from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi how are you doing robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one is i know we talked earlier about demand for loans not that great but im and im also wondering is there a credit box widening event that or process we should be thinking about given that credit quality is so good william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc probably not robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well weve always said we dont change our box yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think an issue right now its kind of pretty straightforward the companies who otherwise in the normal cycle would be out refinancing and perhaps increasing lines are holding off under some assumption that credits going to get cheaper either through rate or through spread and so theres a backlog building i dont i think we wait for that market to come to us i dont think theres a big appetite on anyones part to go out and go with a loss leading price particularly given the funding markets today so i think itll be slow for a while until people are kind of forced into this new environment and new pricing and then youll see growth betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right separately on the regulatory i know youve said in the past that your lcr ratio is compliant no matter how you measure it when you say no matter how you measure it are you talking about hey even if you were at a gsib standard is that what youre referring to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont know the exact quote but we put the ratio out there for a while and while im not sure the ratio this quarter would qualify for the full but its very close and historically its been over the full even though were measured at the threshold betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no its much higher than anybody else we ph calc robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i was just wondering if thats what you were thinking about there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay last tickytacky thing is just on the fdic special assessment im not sure if i heard this right or not but is that in your full year expense guide william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc or should we be thinking about robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no no no thanks for asking that betsy so no the fdic assessment that i was referring to was the one that was announced last year that went into place at the beginning of this year it doesnt relate to the special assessment thats being contemplated for the silicon valley bank and signature bank which we expect to be finalized sometime in the second half so our guidance does not include that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and that you would be putting below the line is that right robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well wed be expensing it but we need to understand what that number is betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks so much robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks betsy operator operator instructions our next question is coming from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey guys good morning the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just had a couple of followup questions one i think you talked about interest in expansion i guess as it pertains to ma when you talk to investors and bank management teams it appears that there are three hurdles to that one is lack of policy alignment in dc marktomarket purchase accounting and then the macro bill if you had to rate them which of these three is the biggest hurdle to trigger a little bit of consolidation in the sector william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think for look i think for the industry broadly its fair value accounting on targets where even moes at this point there have to be for most banks it would get together a fairly substantial capital raise and thats going to stop people from doing things i think youve heard quite loudly coming out of dc recognition that theres going to need to be consolidation in the industry to create competition against some of the giant banks so i dont know that that shows up largely on a hurdle and the final thing is just the franchise value of what you might look at its people used to do deals just for size i think were in an environment in a credit environment where that can be dangerous because i think theres a lot of bad balance sheets out there heavy real estate concentration and other things that would be a red flag ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but the marktomarket is the primary challenge ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess no way to resolve that the lower rates at some point william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just as a followup on interest rates and your deposit beta guidance it all feels incremental well within control if the fed is close to being done do you see a big risk of deposit behavior shifting back book repricing down the road or if the fed is actually done were getting close to the end game error the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so a couple of things i want to go back to your comment on just quickly on weve got to wait for rates to go lower you dont necessarily need rates to go lower you need the existing book to pull the par right one of the so for example our securities book because of short duration will pull the par very quickly others some have long book some have short book so itll vary across the industry the issue of deposit betas if the fed just freezes and stays there for a long period of time you would have deposit beta creep ph where at the margin thered be competition for deposits as long as q2 was ongoing and youd see some bleed to the upside i dont know how large that would be its were kind of assuming some of that in our guidance but i think thats a real issue and weve seen it in past history when the fed was done robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and at particularly in the interestbearing consumer william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc deposits which could still go up even though the fed stops or cuts william stanton demchak a chairman
