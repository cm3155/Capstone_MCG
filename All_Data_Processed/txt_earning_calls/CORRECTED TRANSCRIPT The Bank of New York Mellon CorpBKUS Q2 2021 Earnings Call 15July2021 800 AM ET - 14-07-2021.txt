director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you marius and good morning everyone now im going to touch on a few of the highlights before i hand it over to emily and shell review our second quarter financial results and the outlook for the second half of the year in more detail so if we refer to slide of the financial highlights presentation we reported eps of thats on billion of revenue and we generated a return on tangible common equity of fee revenue was up yearoveryear and it was up excluding the impact of money market fee waivers average deposits were down quarter overquarter this together with strong capital generation drove an approximately basis point increase in our tier leverage ratio and were pleased with the results of this years supervisory stress tests which once again demonstrated the resilience of our business model and the strength of our balance sheet even under severe stress and we also welcome the feds decision to lift the recent restrictions on common stock dividends and share repurchases at the end of june now taking a step back for a look at the broader operating environment we continue to be impacted by the significant amount of excess cash in the system we welcome the feds decision to raise the ioer and the overnight reverse repo rate by basis points last month that provided a bit of support to short term rates although they continue to be exceptionally low by historical standards money market funds takeup of the feds reverse repo facility increased from approximately billion prior to the feds action to north of billion and they actually spiked to almost trillion at quarter end this means that somewhere between and of total us money market fund assets are being parted to fed earning basis points now given the significant amount of excess cash in the system and the expectation for further fed balance sheet expansion bank balance sheets will continue to be under pressure but money market funds may provide some relief now lets turn to a few highlights across the franchise and ill start with asset servicing in asset servicing we continue to see good momentum as clients increasingly transform their operating models and theyre looking to us for open modular fronttoback solutions including our leading data and analytics solutions that they can build their own businesses on as an example we were awarded new business from lockheed martin and it was led by asset servicing but it really leveraged our capabilities across the enterprise we were awarded custody and a full suite of related services as lockheed was looking to consolidate providers across custody and hedge funds administration this large corporate asset owner win demonstrates the power of our omni offering to bring a wide breadth of services which includes data and analytics leading fintech partnerships and other capabilities from across the enterprise together which happened to differentiate us from our competitors in this process we also continue to drive innovation in digital assets we are excited to have recently been mandated by grayscale thats the worlds largest digital currency asset manager to provide fund accounting and administrative services for the bitcoin trust once conversion to an etf is secapproved we will be able to service the product as an etf as well while also providing our unique transfer agency and etf basket creation services on etf more broadly we continue to see good momentum in etf servicing with etf auca reaching trillion at the end of june and weve now helped to launch over etfs yeartodate weve also continued to strengthen our capabilities through additional partnerships with leading fintechs in last week we announced the acquisition of milestone this acquisition will help us advance the digitization and automation of core accounting and asset servicing capabilities the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 if you recall roughly about a year ago we formed an elite alliance with milestone to address an industry need for greater fund oversight and resiliency following on the success of this alliance we saw an opportunity to build on the strategic relationship and further our capabilities in ocio services cash allocation and fair value controls id also like to highlight our recently announced partnerships with saphyre and evisort because both are terrific examples of how we are using open architecture to automate and digitize operations improve the client experience and driving efficiencies moving on to our markets infrastructure businesses pershing had another strong quarter benefiting from equity market strength and continued strong underlying fundamentals the number of clearing accounts continues to grow at a healthy clip and we saw strong net new asset flows and the sales pipeline there remains robust in may we reshaped pershings operating model into two segments institutional solutions and wealth solutions and we did that to organize around our clients and align our expertise to best serve their needs aligning around these two segments enables us to focus our people tech investments and process improvements to fuel growth institutional solutions serves capital markets firms investment banks hedge funds and alternative investment managers pershings institutional platform provides clients with a single seamless experience backed by the strength and scale of bny mellon offering financing collateral management global trade execution securities lending and syndicate capabilities now wealth solutions addresses the evolving and converging needs of our wealthminded brokerdealer and ria clients by delivering improved lending digitized account opening and streamlined asset transfers given the rapid growth in the wealth advisory segment we are making significant new investment to further build out our advisory capabilities in markets we were able to offset some of the headwinds from meaningfully lower volatility and narrowing spreads by growing our client volumes significantly reflecting the success of the initiatives weve put in place to strengthen our capabilities and improve client targeting across our investment services business in fact last week euromoney ranked us in categories of its fx survey and for the first time we claimed the spot as realmoney overall market leader globally in treasury services we saw strong growth in quarterly payment volumes compared to the prior year and the business experienced healthy client wins in payments liquidity and trade across all geographic regions in june we introduced crosscurrency sweeps the latest addition to our rapidly expanding liquidity management product suite and earlier in may we launched the first of its kind realtime ebill and payment solution that we talked about in the past were the first bank leveraging the new york clearing houses realtime payments network to provide corporations with an instant digital consumer bill pay service and today were actively collaborating with multiple billers and retail banks to drive the adoption of this new functionality our production pilots will continue this year and were planning to scale them more broadly into in investment management we had our fifth consecutive quarter of net inflows into longterm products we continue to see strong net inflows in the cash products and we ended the quarter with record aum weve been making good progress in our realignment to transfer mellon capabilities in fixed income equity and multiasset and liquidity management to insight newton and dreyfus cash respectively and that was the purpose to bring specialist investment capabilities at scale and we remain on track for completion of this in the third quarter were pleased to see that were already starting to drive efficiencies and feedback from clients and industry consultants has been quite positive in last month euan munro joined us as the new head of newton euan the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 brings three decades of experience with a proven track record in the investment industry including extensive experience leading one of the uks largest asset managers with a presence in institutional intermediary and retail markets and finally in wealth management we saw another quarter of strong client asset flows and client assets exceeded billion for the first time the financial times named bny mellon the best private bank for digital wealth planning in north america and theyre recognizing there our wealth online client portal and our proprietary goalsbased planning tool we call advicepath taken together were pleased with the increased momentum that were seeing across the franchise which is resulting in organic fee growth in excess of our outlook for the year our strong performance in the first half of the year and significant capital generation have put us in a position to further accelerate investments and a number of meaningful growth and modernization opportunities in the second half now before i turn it over to emily to review our second quarter results and the outlook for the second half of the year in more detail id like to provide a quick update on our plans for the return to the office and the future of the workplace starting in september were planning to begin safely opening our offices around the world although dates and details may vary by location as we continue to monitor and as conditions evolve we believe that in the process we have an opportunity to create a new and better way of working that makes us feel more connected balanced and productive while maintaining flexibility the majority of our almost colleagues around the world will therefore follow a hybrid model that allows for a flexible mix of remote and inperson experiences going forward with that ill hand it over to emily emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd and good morning everyone as i walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise beginning on page total revenue was lower by due to lower net interest revenue and higher money market fee waivers partially offset by strong fee growth fee revenue grew or excluding the impact of fee waivers this reflects the positive impact of higher market values the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar and higher client activity other revenue was million and included approximately million of investment disposal and other income gains net interest revenue was down expenses increased with about two thirds driven by the weaker us dollar provision for credit losses was a benefit of million driven by an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast eps was and pretax margin was moving to page which shows a trend analysis of the main drivers of our quarterly results investment services revenue was billion down yearonyear mainly driven by lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers excluding fee waivers investment services fee and other revenue was up reflecting increased client activity and organic growth in assets from existing clients higher liquidity balances and market levels and the benefit of the weaker us dollar investment and wealth management revenue of million sic billion increased as higher market values and the benefit of the weaker us dollar more than offset the impact of fee waivers excluding fee waivers fee and other revenue was up money market fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense was million in the quarter up million from the prior quarter which impacted pretax income by approximately million sequentially higher waivers were driven by lower tbill and repo rates as well as higher average balances the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 turning to page our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums our cet1 ratio was flat to q1 under the standardized approach and our tier leverage ratio which is our binding capital constraint was up approximately basis points sequentially due to net capital generation and a quarteroverquarter decrease in average asset average deposit balances declined by as weve been successful at curtailing deposit growth by working with our clients to move excess deposits to off balance sheet vehicles namely money market funds which were up roughly sequentially outpacing the industry finally our lcr was flat to the prior quarter turning to page my comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes q2 net interest revenue was million down the decrease was largely driven by the impact of lower short term rates continued elevated prepayment speeds and lower reinvestment yields turning to page which will provide some color on deposits and our securities portfolio trends and mix as mentioned average deposit balances declined by a little over billion sequentially despite the fed act adding billion of liquidity into the system through its bond purchase program and the treasury general account having declined by about billion in the quarter our deposits remain elevated versus a year ago up billion or we estimate that a portion of this growth is excess in nature and is expected to run off when rates rise turning to the securities portfolio on average the portfolio was flat to the first quarter and up approximately billion or over the prior year average loans increased about both sequentially and yearoveryear with growth primarily driven by pershing margin loans wealth management collateralized loans and capital call financing as well as term secured loans to global financial institutions turning to page as i mentioned earlier expenses of approximately billion for the quarter were higher by versus the prior year with about twothirds of the increase driven by the unfavorable impact of the weaker us dollar the remainder was primarily driven by volume and revenuerelated expenses and investments in efficiency and growth initiatives turning to page total revenue in the investment services segment declined by versus the prior year fx revenue in investment services declined yearoveryear driven by lower volatility and spreads partially offset by strong growth in client volume on a sequential basis fx revenue declined on lower volumes especially in emerging markets lower spreads and volatility assets under custody andor administration increased by yearoveryear to trillion driven by higher market levels net new business and a favorable impact of the weaker us dollar as i discuss the investment services businesses i will focus my comments on total fees in each business within the asset servicing line of business we saw growth on the back of higher client activity and market levels which more than offset lower fx revenue the growth was offset by a roughly basis point impact from fee waivers fees in pershing were up reflecting higher market levels and solid organic growth partially offset by higher fee waivers and lower transaction volumes compared to an exceptional quarter a year ago clearing accounts were up mutual fund assets were up and we saw continued strong net asset flows of billion in the quarter waivers impacted fee growth by approximately basis points fees in issuer services had underlying growth in drs which saw a resumption of client issuance and dividend activity to precovid levels as well as in corporate trust on the back of higher clo mtn and mortgage refi activity this growth was offset by the impact of fee waivers in corporate trust treasury services fees were up the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 driven by higher payment volume and a continued shift to higher margin products in fact on june the business processed a record trillion in us dollar payments finally clearance and collateral management fees were down slightly as continued strength in collateral management was offset by lower clearance volumes and lower intraday financing fees elevated levels of us money fund aum and international demand for hqla collateral are both providing long term tailwinds for our collateral management business page summarizes the key drivers that affect the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses turning to investment and wealth management on page total investment and wealth management revenues increased versus the prior year assets under management grew to a record trillion up yearover year primarily due to higher market values the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar principally versus the british pound and net client inflows we had net inflows of billion in the second quarter driven by ldi fixed income and cash strategies as todd said this is our fifth consecutive quarter of long term inflows investment management revenue grew due to higher market values the benefit of a weaker us dollar higher performance fees and net inflows despite a negative impact from fee waivers wealth management revenue also grew due to higher market values investment performance and growth in collateralized loans client assets in wealth management were a record billion up yearoveryear page includes the results of the other segment ill conclude with a few comments about the outlook as we think about the second half of based on a current forward curve we now expect nir on a full year basis to be down approximately compared to also using the forward curve and assuming flat balances we estimate fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense to be approximately million in the third quarter slightly better than the million this quarter driven by the slightly higher shortterm rate outlook this is estimated to have a modest pretax benefit of million next quarter with regard to fees exwaivers recall that we guided at yearend for growth to be about given the strong first half of this year we now expect full year fees exwaivers to be up between and on expenses we now expect the full year to be up closer to excluding notable items approximately half of the yearoveryear growth is expected to be related to currency and the other half is pretty evenly split over higher volume and revenuerelated expenses and incremental investments in a number of attractive growth and efficiency opportunities we still expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately and with respect to capital returns our board just declared a cash dividend of per share for the third quarter representing an approximately increase and authorized up to billion of common stock repurchases over the next six quarters through the end of considering the billion of excess capital that weve accumulated and the significant amount of capital that were generating we expect to buyback well in excess of of our earnings in the near term and remember the scb framework allows for additional capital actions over time if and when appropriate subject to additional authorization by our board with that operator can you please open the line for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much and thanks for taking away like of my questions with that outlook that was helpful can i get us a followup on the expense question so if you look at yearonyear it was up i heard your guide expenses were down quarteroverquarter can we talk about the growth opportunities you mentioned what growth opportunities are you investing in and what kind of payback can we expect how do you think about that given your huge excess capital my real question is why not invest more so thats where im going with it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp its a great question glenn thank you so as you have rightfully pointed out we have been extraordinarily disciplined on expenses and weve actually held them flat over the course of last four years everything that were talking about here are investments in growth and efficiency just to name a few so certainly digital assets and all the things we talked about around digital assets data and analytics advisory services in pershing as well as the managed account space id highlight also electronic payment and collection services in treasury services and then the remainder would be modernizing and automating both our risk management and our operations infrastructure and really as you alluded to we had a very strong half we have a very strong capitalgenerative model there are interesting opportunities all of these have been properly vetted and truly will drive incremental growth and efficiency so we feel now its an important time to invest thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp glenn youre still there i think we lost you glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi oh yeah sorry about that i appreciate all that emily maybe just a quick followup on pershing so in past you spoke about maybe some headwinds in the second half are you able to quantify that just to give us that heads up on what to expect in the second half and maybe at the high level talk about the competitive backdrop there because it seems like some yet another competitor is poking their nose in and trying to get involved on the ria clearing side emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure i can start and im sure todd can add just in terms of the impact of the lost business that we had talked about in the past its going to be about million per quarter going forward and that is by the way glenn baked into the forecast so that is embedded in there and yes it is a competitive space and actually that particular piece of business that were talking about was really we were just on the wrong side of some ma activity so although we see a lot of growth and a lot of opportunity theres certainly further consolidation as well the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah and i would add the consolidation that weve seen is actually a positive for us so weve got a very robust pipeline we continue to add a significant number of accounts over the course of the quarter and as well as seeing significant growth in funds and we think theres opportunity to actually invest more so what we did this quarter is we actually separated the businesses into two one is the institutional side where we have some unique capabilities with some very large clients and weve got some pretty good leads there that were excited about but also on the advisory and the brokerdealer side we think we can invest there and garner some more whats a very fastgrowing industry there is some competition there but the consolidation has also provided some opportunity for us so we do get every now and then you get a lumpy loss due to an ma weve looked at over history that really it hasnt changed we probably won more than weve lost but we have pointed out that will have an impact in the third quarter glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thats awesome thanks for all of that both of you thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks glenn operator our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport research please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning can you speak to your efforts on deposits it seems like you had some success keeping deposits flat to down is that deliberate efforts on your part with less demand for your balance sheet maybe you could just speak to the deposit growth in the quarter and how you think about it going forward emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure ill take that so youre right we have been proactively managing deposits and very successfully weve been working with our clients and you can see that in our trends so despite the fed continuing to pump excess liquidity into the system ultimately we have managed our deposits and theyre down sequentially this has been very much a coordinated effort with our salespeople and our clients and in terms of looking at whats excess on our balance sheet we probably think we have about billion to billion thats still excess but what we have been doing is looking at what is excess and actually working with our clients to move it to off balance sheet vehicles such as money market funds thats partially why you see a growth in our money market fund balances that were driving waivers and were fortunate too in that we have a very robust liquidity solutions business we offer both inhouse as well as thirdparty solutions and that has been certainly very attractive to our clients as weve endeavored to manage the balance sheet and look going forward we will continue to do that were comfortable where we are but certainly we will continue to do that considering there will likely be more liquidity coming into the system the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp jim its a very disciplined process that emily leads along with the salespeople and treasury function and we look at it clientbyclient and the good news is weve been able to capture most of that in our money market funds or our liquiditydirect offerings and so we are gaining market share there and weve got a little bit of benefit when the fed did increase the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo that made that alternative theyve provided a bit of an outlet so we think even though the fed will probably continue to provide liquidity and build their balance sheet that we should be able to manage it james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners right thats helpful and then just as a followup to that if you think youve had success on the leverage ratio when we think about the buyback that youre targeting over the next months can you frontload that how do we think about the cadence of buybacks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so certainly the cadence of buybacks is going to be determined by lots of different factors our capital position our forward outlook for earnings et cetera but you can definitely assume that considering we have about billion of excess capital now and thats just against our binding constraint of tier leverage frankly we have more excess capital when you actually think about what a normalized balance sheet size probably is when some of those excess deposits recede so assuming taking that into account taking into account the fact that weve also committed to our shareholders that we will return of earnings over time its safe to assume that well probably frontload that billion of authorization that weve received from the board james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thats great thanks operator next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey thanks good morning everybody so maybe just starting with the nir guide for the back half it looks like the amount continues to kind of grind lower a little bit and maybe given what the forward curve has done relative to last quarter not particularly surprising but curious if you guys feel like the most of the pain is now in the run rate is this the right sort of jumping off point to think about as we sort of start to pencil that into emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 sure so i hesitate to call a trough because every time we do its not accurate but in terms of just our outlook we just use the forward curve when we project nir we dont try to get cute short term rates are a bit lower in the forward curve than they were a couple of months ago likewise as you all have seen the long end has come down and the curve is flattening and likewise in terms of prepayment speeds they have been elevated and although we do expect them to slow down by the end of the year theyre probably going to still be more elevated than we had originally anticipated so all of those things are just baked into the down yearonyear thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah a couple of things i mean one of the key drivers are the short term rates when you look at libors and obviously when you look at the fed funds rate or the ioer so the fact that that has stabilized and it stabilized a bit in the forward curve at least out the next six months or so so the downside drag to that from where we are is probably not likely to be much unless something else were to change and then were going to have to look at the impact of term rates as we do reprice assets as they come out of the investment portfolio but our best guess right now is were pretty close to the trough and as we think through money market fee waivers it does feel like the support in the reverse repo program has probably bottomed that out emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thats helpful thank you i was hoping to dig through a couple of business line items as well maybe just focusing on asset servicing for a second it seems like the business is seeing pretty decent momentum here when i sort of back out money market fee waivers from the asset servicing line it looks like it was up quarteronquarter yearoveryear so despite obviously moderating industry volumes backdrop can you help us bridge maybe what sort of the sources of growth here are sequentially and as were sort of thinking ahead over the next sort of months to months what do you expect to be the bigger contributors to growth here i know theres a bunch of things that go in there right theres the custody and admin business but then theres also triparty repo and a couple of other things thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so let me start with the more traditional custody business i think were having quite a bit of success there weve won a couple of very nice mandates this year our sales growth is ahead of where its been the etf business is growing very nicely its up significantly on a yearoveryear basis our capabilities there are quite good in our venture with cibc mellon weve actually won of the etfs that have been listed on the tse and so were seeing healthy growth there and weve got about opportunities in our digital asset space so that is getting some traction and weve got really good flows across a number of our existing organic flows with our existing clients so its a combination of all of that alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks very much the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 operator our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to start with the balance sheet you touched on the estimate of excess deposits that was really helpful thanks for that emily curious about what drove though on the funding cost side the improvement quarteroverquarter was there any noise in that or do you think thats sustainable and then when we think about squaring the guide for balances what are you assuming for deposit growth from here for the rest of the year thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so just on the funding side really there was a benefit of also lower rates there so that was what was driving it nothing else really notable thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah a lot of our debt is swap to floating so as we saw lower libors we saw that through that as well emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp exactly and then i think the other question was the what was the second part of the question thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp balance sheet growth emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp oh balance sheet growth yeah as similar to what i had alluded to before we will continue to monitor and proactively manage the balance sheet we do have room should deposits go up further but of course like i said based on the excess that we have wed like to kind of stay where we are and frankly manage it down further brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and then when we think about servicing the servicing revenue and alex touched on this a little what was the contribution of activity this quarter what was the benefit of new business was there some did that come in late in the quarter from a i know we its an imperfect way to model but the way we all model this it looks like the fee rate got hit this quarter so what were some of the dynamics there and how should we be thinking about that going forward emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp i mean if youre talking about like asset servicing versus auca which i think is kind of what youre alluding to auca was up sequentially about onethird of that was market and currency driven and the remainder was really organic growth so some really good kind of organic growth when you look at that though against asset the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 servicing fees and revenues like when we think about it its generally helpful rather than look at the to probably look at the spot sorry rather than look at the spot at the average growth in auca which was about and then when you look at the asset servicing fee line it was flat but exwaivers was up and actually as weve kind of reminded folks in the past when we look asset servicing fees only or so are truly driven by asset levels the remainder are driven by accountbased fees and transaction fees so hopefully that helps thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah when you get under it all if you look at really what is the organic growth rate underneath across the businesses especially in the investment services business when we look at fees only if you exclude market appreciation or depreciation and the currency impact waivers and some of the extraordinary volumes that we had in the second quarter of last year due to covid if you net that out and net the fee waivers out were seeing probably something like or slightly better than in the core organic growth brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning emily on the fee side exwaivers you talked about the improvement on your outlook to from and im just wondering how much of that was just a pullthrough of the first half as you mentioned or if you are actually more confident in what youre seeing in some of the core businesses following on the last few questions about the underlying growth that you are seeing in other fee areas emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so ultimately the to is fees exwaiver growth over the course of will be yearonyear so you have some of the numbers to do the math in the first half we had about growth in the second half it will still be very very healthy but probably closer to kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay all right so it was more of the just how good its been and then stays is the way to think about it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp exactly kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and just todd coming back to you laid out a lot of new product intros youve been talking about this for a while i guess the challenge for us is to understand how these product intros turn into revenues and the timeframe by which they do convert and youve talked about the organic growth improving directionally over time the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 but how quickly can we start to see some of these improvements and new intros really starting to roll into the income statement and are there other ones that you can give examples of where theyre live and now starting to be meaningful contributors thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure ken so as we described in the past if you looked at our organic growth over the past few years before last year it was basically flat and so now were starting to get some traction as weve improved a number of our services invested in our data and analytics capabilities and weve talked about our digital assets capability so were already starting to see some benefit in these numbers now that were seeing an underlying growth rate more like were already starting to see some benefit to things like our custody and etf servicing business around some of the digital assets our investments in the etf business is starting to come through and show up in the numbers a bit some of the longer term investments that were looking to make like pershing where were really investing in the platform we dont expect that to really turn into revenues for as long as two years so some of these are longer term and some of them are coming through as we talk about them on the treasury services side where you see us gaining some market share and weve had pretty healthy organic growth there the multicurrency sweeps its caught a lot of attention when we announced that we have clients in it today and we think that will gain some traction over the next year or so and i would say the same thing with what were doing with realtime payments and collections so weve mapped it out its kind of all over the board some of them are as far as two years or three years out some of the investments that were making in custody we would expect to have a return maybe a year out and some of them are starting to bump into and help us generate a positive organic growth rate of the that were seeing today operator and well take our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks just want to come back to the auca up to trillion from the trillion you mentioned about twothirds of that was organic can you parse that out a bit between organic from the client base in terms of net inflows at your clients it seems like trillions a large number so i just wanted to sort of understand new business won by bny mellon versus the underlying client growth and then if you can also comment on the demand for cryptocurrency servicing obviously the grayscale mandate which is great are you seeing an increase in that demand in the second quarter versus what i know that began to spike up in the first quarter thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay so brian when you look at our flows and the growth on a yearoveryear basis about half of it is flows that would include net new new business and it would also include any lost business and any organic flows from existing clients so hooking on some winners as they generate new funds that would be new business for us and then the combination a little more than half is market and currency and the rest of it is coming from the client flows brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 im sorry i meant on a sequential basis from trillion to the trillion thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay on a sequential basis that number is its pretty similar its probably emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp actually a bit more on the sequential basis its about more of it is based on net new business than currency and markets than it was a yearonyear thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah its about not quite brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and then you asked a question around demand for bitcoin services weve mentioned earlier we have initiated quite a few etfs in canada where they can be traded on the tsc so weve got of the etfs that exist there and there is activity there and grayscale which is the largest asset manager of digital currencies weve teamed up and partnered with them both to help them with the existing trust and when and if they get approval from the sec to list the etfs theyll take on our ta and other capabilities there as well so we are seeing some interest and then were also seeing some interest on the what id say the high net worth side so there is some retail interest that were hearing through some of the pershing clients as well as other wealth management players emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp its worth just adding to that that we have been mandated on the of the filings for the indiscernible thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp for the us emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah in the us that are in front of the sec now the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay thats great and then just a quick followup on the assumptions for nir and the money market fund fee waivers you mentioned trying to move more of those excess deposits into money market funds just in the assumptions of the guidance that you gave are you assuming some of that transfer from those excess deposits in terms of both the fee waivers moving down which would be good if you were expecting an increase in money market fund balances and then same with the balance sheet side as we move into yearend given that guidance is there an assumption of conversion of deposits to money market fund balances within that guidance emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure ill take both and im sure todd will chime in on the waiver side really were just using the forward curve and were just assuming balances stay flat as we talked about before the fed actually taking some action with technical rates and raising the reverse repo rate by basis points has been extraordinarily helpful and that has put a bit of a floor in terms of gross fund yield and so that is largely whats driving the improvement that we expect in the second quarter from a run rate of about what was million this quarter to about million so in terms of going forward of course as we start to recoup some of that its very dependent upon obviously it will be very dependent upon balance levels but thats going to be sometime in the future from a deposit perspective where as i mentioned before we have a material amount of excess still on the balance sheet were fine in terms of where we are but yes wed like to manage that down a bit thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so brian what i would add to that is so yeah were projecting that those balances are going to come down a little bit in the number for nir and you got to remember when we had all this excess capital and there was nothing we can do about it it wasnt particularly in our interest to push those balances away because they did make even though it was modest they did make a little bit of incremental income but the return on capital was very poor so now that we have the flexibility to manage our capital base through the new regime wed very much want to be much more efficient with the usage of the balance sheet now we didnt try to marry that with how much if the balance sheet comes down how much of that is going to come into fee waivers and remember if we are growing the money market funds were waiving a pile of the fees as well so fee waivers go up a little bit even though there is some net benefit to us from that we didnt try to solve that in the guidance that we gave you we just made it simple but its not going to be a material number brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it got it thats great color thank you operator our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 good morning everyone just wanted to follow up on a couple of the business lines you called out particularly noticed that issuer services and treasury services performed well you mentioned some of the drivers particularly the new product in treasury services but wondering how sustainable you think the growth rates seen in this quarter are going forward thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think we continue to see as we continue to invest in our payments platform and volumes are moving nicely and were capturing a little bit of market share as we look out we think its sustainable that we can see some decent growth and were introducing some new products that are getting some takeup so the realtime payments for collections is going to be a very interesting product and weve got a pretty robust pipeline for that we look forward to announcing something in the nottoodistant future around opportunities there and so i think the team has done a good job of capturing that high margin business i think the sales effort globally has been strong and i think were wellpositioned to be a provider of services around the globe weve got great relationships and i think were benefiting from that so i think theres a little bit of room for continued growth there when you look at issuer services that includes corporate trust as well as the dr business corporate trust weve made good inroads in the clo business frankly a few years ago we lost a little market share were capturing that weve rebuilt our platform there and then very good growth in conventional debt servicing and drs they were very much impacted by covid and so now that were seeing some of these global companies paying dividends again were seeing a little more activity there and so i think theres room to sustain where we are and grow a bit off of it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp and just two quick things id add in the treasury services space its a very fragmented market so its ultimately even a little bit of share gain actually moves the needle considerably and in dr as todd alluded to just the third quarter tends to be seasonally our best quarter we had a very strong second quarter again as todd alluded to with the resumption of dividends and certainly issuance activity so the step up will probably be a little bit less in the third quarter robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of rajiv bhatia with morningstar rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research good morning just a quick question on your margins so your investment servicing margin was curious if you can provide any color on the pretax margins of the various lobs within there so for example i think several years ago you spoke about issuer services and treasury services being higher margin thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2021 okay rajiv we dont disclose the operating margins across the various businesses and we did benefit in that margin obviously from the reserve release because a lot of that is related to it but we did see a little bit of underlying margin improvement but the operating margins of the various businesses most of them are similar to what we see across the total for example clearance and collateral is a bit higher rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research thank you operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call back over to todd with any additional or closing remarks thomas p gibbons chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and thanks everybody for joining us today i know its a very busy day so we appreciate the engagement and look forward to talking to you soon thank you very much operator
