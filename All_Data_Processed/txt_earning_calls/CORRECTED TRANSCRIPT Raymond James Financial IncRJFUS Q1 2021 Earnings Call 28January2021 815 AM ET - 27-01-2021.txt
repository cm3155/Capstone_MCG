happy to turn it over to chairman and ceo paul reilly paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning and thank you for joining us today its hard to believe its been almost a year since the covid19 pandemic started here in the us and while there is now light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine starting to be distributed across the globe we are still very much in a period of uncertainty and volatility as painful as the pandemic has been for everyone im very proud of how raymond james has performed who would have predicted when we lost of our earnings to the rate cuts in march that we would be talking about records today this is a testament not only to the resiliency of the us economy but also to raymond james our advisors and their associates as you can see on slide our unwavering focus on serving clients resulted in fantastic financial results during the quarter starting off fiscal with record quarterly revenues and earnings driven by strength across our businesses in the fiscal first quarter the firm reported record net revenues of billion which were up over the prior years fiscal first quarter and over the prior record set in the preceding quarter record net raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 income of million or per diluted share increased over the prior record of net income set a year ago quarter and over the preceding quarter excluding expenses of million associated with the completed acquisitions of nwps holdings and the pending acquisition of financo adjusted quarterly net income was million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was both records annualized return on equity for the quarter was and return on tangible common equity was an impressive result especially in this near zero rate environment and given our very strong capital position record quarterly results were primarily attributable to higher asset management and related administrative fees record investment banking revenues strong fixed income brokerage revenues and disciplined expense management which were more than offset the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates on the net interest income and rjbdp fees the record results and broad based strengths in our businesses in this near zero rate interest environment which included record results for capital markets and asset management segments during the quarter reinforced the value of our diverse and complementary businesses sometimes something underappreciated in different market cycles moving to slide we ended the quarter with records for total client assets under administration of trillion pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion client assets crossing the trillion mark for the first time is a testament to the consistent growth that weve achieved by focusing on retaining our existing advisors while also recruiting high quality financial advisors and when you step back this is quite an achievement in december of we had around billion of client assets so we have experienced around a compounded annual growth and essentially quadrupled client assets over a 10year period and the vast majority of that was organic growth we ended the quarter with financial advisors a net increase of over the prior year but a slight net decrease of sequentially a flat advisor count is not unusual for this quarter as we typically see an elevated number of retirements at the yearend where assets are typically retained at raymond james by their successor we are still optimistic about all of our recruiting pipelines across our affiliation options but there are a few trends we are seeing in the industry on the independent side of the business we continue to experience strong recruiting activity and were seeing more interest from both external and internal advisors in the ria custody affiliation option particularly for much larger teams who have the scale and appetite to assume the regulatory and supervision responsibilities and risks we have been beneficiaries of this trend in our rebranded ria custody services division or rcs and we believe well continue to benefit from the trend given major consolidation and disruption in the ria custody industry however its important to note that when an ria affiliates with rcs whether it be an internal transfer from our other affiliation option or external editions we do not count the advisors of the ria firms in our advisor count but their assets are still included in client assets under administration on the employee side there has been a modest slowdown in recruiting due to the challenges brought on by covid and also increased competition for experienced advisors for even our regional competitors have significantly increased their recruiting packages in response to what we have seen we have also enhanced our recruiting packages to be more competitive while also ensuring attractive returns to our shareholders raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 also impacting advisor count this year we temporarily decreased the size of our new advisor training class this year by about trainees allowing us to dedicate more time and attention to newer advisors as they seek to overcome the challenges presented by this current virtual environment while this will negatively impact the growth in advisor count when compared to prior years when the training class was larger it really shouldnt have a significant impact on client assets we believe our recruiting will continue to thrive as advisors are attracted to our supportive culture and clientfirst values looking at recruiting results over the prior four quarters financial advisors with nearly million of trailing production and nearly billion of assets at their prior firms affiliated with raymond james domestically as for our net organic growth results in the private client group we generated domestic pcg net new assets of billion over the four quarters ending in december representing more than of domestic pcg client assets at the beginning of the period and remember this is net of client fees we are very pleased with our consistent organic growth especially given the disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic during the year and as you know we did not benefit from the surge in selfdirected online business during the year moving to segment results on slide the private client group generated quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million quarterly net revenues grew over the preceding quarter predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees reflecting higher assets in feebased accounts which will continue to be a tailwind in the second quarter this strong revenue growth helped the pcgs pretax income grow sequentially although its still down on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates capital markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million an extraordinary result a strong quarter for the segment driven by broad based strength across global equities and investment banking as well as fixed income during the quarter record investment banking revenues were driven by record ma revenues along with continued strength in debt and equity underwriting fixed income brokerage revenues were strong as client activity levels remained robust while we certainly would caution you against annualizing the record results at capital markets segment this quarter i do think the results reflect the significant investments we have made to strengthen our platform over the last years and we are continuing to make those investments as i will discuss shortly the asset management segment generated record net revenues of million and pretax income of million record results were driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market appreciation and the net inflows into pcg feebased accounts more than offset the modest net outflows for carillon tower advisers lastly raymond james bank generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million compared to a year ago quarter net revenues declined primarily due to the impact of lower shortterm interest rates on net interest income sequentially quarterly net revenues grew as higher asset balances more than offset the basis point decline in the banks net interest margin in the quarter which was primarily attributable to the growth in the agency mbs portfolio the credit quality of the banks portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve nonperforming assets remain low at basis points of total assets and the amount of criticized loans declined during the quarter the quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of million declined sequentially and was driven mostly by macroeconomic model inputs now under the cecl methodology which paul shoukry will cover in more detail raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 moving to slide as youve heard me say many times we remain focused on longterm growth and are committed to deploying excess capital to generate attractive returns to our shareholders good examples of that commitment are the two acquisitions we announced during the quarter the first which closed in late december is nwps nwps is a provider of a retirement plan administration consulting actuarial and administrative services based in seattle washington the addition of nwps allows raymond james to expand our retirement services offerings including retirement plan administration services to advisors and clients many of our advisors serve clients with small businesses and offering this retirement solution is another attractive way to help advisors develop deeper and stronger relationship with their clients the second pending acquisition financo is a consumerfocused ma advisory firm which allows us to strategically grow our capabilities in an attractive vertical with industry leading team we anticipate this transaction to close in the march or april timeframe both of these firms represent great cultural and strategic fits and were excited about welcoming them to the raymond james family while we are not going to discuss the terms of these two transactions in total over time these two acquisitions represent consideration retention and earnout potential for the sellers of approximately million so its a meaningful and attractive use of cash and capital we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisitions that are both cultural and strategic fits and now for a more detailed review of the financial results im going to turn this over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thank you paul ill begin with consolidated revenues on slide record quarterly net revenues of billion grew year over year and sequentially asset management fees grew on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially commensurate with the growth of feebased assets private client group assets in feebased accounts were up during the fiscal first quarter which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the second quarter of fiscal however given fewer billable days in the march quarter i would expect asset management fees in pcg to increase about sequentially consolidated brokerage revenues of million grew over the prior year and represented a record these revenues are inherently difficult to predict but our clients are still engaged in both the private client group and capital markets segments given the current market and interest rate environment account service fees of million declined yearoveryear almost entirely due to the decrease in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks due to lower shortterm interest rates which i will discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next two slides consolidated investment banking revenues of million grew yearoveryear and sequentially achieving a record result driven by record ma advisory revenues and strong debt and equity underwriting based on the pipeline and activity levels we anticipate second quarter to be healthy but not as strong as the remarkable result achieved in the first quarter as you all know these revenues are very difficult to predict but for the rest of the fiscal year we would be very pleased to achieve the pace of the average quarterly investment banking revenues from the annual record we set in fiscal which would be roughly million to million per quarter on average raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 turning to other revenues which were million for the quarter this line included million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter of whats approximately million were attributable to noncontrolling interests reflected in other expenses moving to slide client domestics cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record billion increasing sequentially and representing of domestic pcg client assets as we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from thirdparty banks more client cash is being held in the client interest program at the brokerdealer you can see those balances grew to billion and most of that growth has been used to purchase shortterm treasuries to meet the associated reserve requirement over time that cash could be redeployed to our bank or thirdparty banks as capacity becomes available which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on shortterm treasuries on slide the top chart displays our firmwide net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks on a combined basis related based on your feedback we have updated our net interest table in the earnings release to incorporate all of the firms interest earning assets and liabilities instead of those balances for just raymond james bank we hope you find this update helpful and as always we thank you for your suggestions to continue enhancing our disclosures as you can see on slide while lower rates have put significant pressure on these revenues since the fed rate cuts in march we did experience a slight uptick in these revenues sequentially helped by the aforementioned growth in client cash balances and higher asset balances at raymond james bank which more than offset the sequential nim compression you see on the bottom left portion of the slide given prepayment speeds of higher yielding securities and mortgages we would expect the banks nim to decline another basis points or so throughout the year however we are hoping that growth in the banks earning assets will more than offset the nim compression and result in continued growth of the firms net interest income i will provide a bit more color on the banks balance sheet growth in a few slides moving to consolidated expenses on slide first compensation expense which is by far our largest expense the compensation ratio decrease sequentially from to during the quarter primarily due to record revenues in the capital markets segment which had a compensation ratio during the quarter and the benefit from the private equity valuation gain which doesnt have direct compensation associated with it as we said last quarter given the near zero shortterm interest rates and the successful implementation of the expense initiative we announced last quarter we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of or better which we still believe is an appropriate target and as we experienced this quarter very strong capital market results in any particular quarter could result in a compensation ratio below noncompensation expenses of million increased million or compared to last years first quarter and almost all of that increase could be explained by the million bank loan provision for credit losses compared to the million benefit in the year ago period and million of noncontrolling interest in other expenses much of which offsets a portion of the million private equity valuation gain reflected in other revenues as we explained and as you can see in these results we have been very focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and noncompensation related expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows our pretax margin trend over the past five quarters pretax margin was in the fiscal first quarter of which was boosted by the record capital markets results as that segment generated a record raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 pretax margin last quarter we talked about generating a to pretax margin on a consolidated basis in this near zero interest rate environment which again we believe is still a reasonable target but as we experienced this quarter there is upside to the margins when the capital markets results are so strong on slide at the end of fiscal first quarter total assets were approximately billion a sequential increase reflecting the dynamic i explained earlier with growth in client cash balances and associated reserves at the brokerdealer this growth of client cash balances on the balance sheet caused our tier leverage ratio to decrease to which is still well above the regulatory requirement liquidity remains very strong with billion of cash at the parent leaving us with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters in december in addition to increasing the quarterly dividend to per share the board of directors authorized share repurchases of up to million which replaced the previous authorization and million remains available under the new authorization in the first quarter we repurchased approximately  for million in average price of approximately per share this fell short of our million quarterly target which we plan on making up for in the subsequent quarters as we are committed to repurchasing at least million to offset share based compensation dilution during the fiscal year one thing many of you have asked us to be more explicit on is our plans for deploying capital which is something we hope to discuss with you in much more detail at our analyst investor day tentatively planned to be held virtually in may but at a high level what i would share with you now is that our goal is to manage down the firms tier leverage ratio closer to over time through a combination of balance sheet growth primarily at the bank as well as more deliberate deployment of capital through a combination of organic growth acquisitions and share repurchases we are not ready to share a specific timeline to achieve this objective and doing so in the middle of a pandemic is probably not the best time to do so but i want to be clear that we are fully committed to managing our capital levels balancing our objectives of optimizing returns to shareholders while ensuring a significant balance sheet flexibility and conservatism on the next two slides we provide additional detail on the banks loan portfolio starting on slide with some detail on raymond james banks asset composition in the pie chart you can see we broke out cre and reit loans into separate categories with the implementation of cecl this quarter the only other thing i would point out on this slide is we have a very well diversified balance sheet at the bank the banks total assets grew sequentially led by growth in the banks loan portfolio about of which was attributable to securities based loans to private client group clients we have decelerated the growth of the securities portfolio at the bank and will likely continue to do so over the near term as spreads for agency mortgage backed securities have gotten extremely tight meanwhile we have resumed growth in certain sectors in the corporate loan portfolio that we believe are less directly exposed to the covid19 pandemic lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank first let me briefly discuss cecl we implemented cecl on october which increased our allowances by approximately million with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention related loans to financial advisors in the private client group segment which now require a larger allowance under cecl than under the incurred loss method raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 about million of that day one impact was related to outstanding bank loans and remember all million hit the balance sheet directly and did not go to the pl we had no chargeoffs in the quarter the quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses was million largely attributable to the macroeconomic model inputs we used from a third party vendor which assumed a greater decline in commercial real estate prices in the near term with a longer recovery period resulting in higher allowances for the cre portfolio from to at the end of the quarter the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans ended the quarter at so we believe we are adequately reserved but that could change rapidly if economic conditions deteriorate but currently we are pleased with the credit quality and the positive trends we are seeing with the loan portfolio and the broader economy now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks paul as for our outlook we remain well positioned entering the second fiscal quarter with the strong capital ratios and record client assets however well continue to face headwinds from a full year of lower short term interest rates and theres still a high degree of uncertainty given the covid19 pandemic and the rollout of the vaccine and a new administration in the private client group segment while recruiting environment is extremely competitive and we face some challenges in a largely virtual environment our advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options and the segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal second quarter with strong sequential growth in feebased accounts private client group feebased assets were up which should be a good tailwind and result in a increase in the associated revenues in the capital markets segment there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic however the investment banking pipeline is currently strong and we expect fixed income brokerage results to remain elevated given the current interest rate and economic conditions in the asset management segment results will be positively impacted by the increase in assets under management but those assets are built throughout the quarter at raymond james bank we should continue to benefit from the attractive growth of securitiesbased loans and mortgages to pcg clients and as we decelerate the growth of securities portfolio we are cautiously adding to corporate loans in the less covid impacted sectors we continue to focus on longterm growth and our priorities remain unchanged our top priority is serving clients and were focused on organic growth which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisors in the private client group additionally were continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses such as investment banking as you observed this quarter we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions but we are still focused on being deliberate and only pursuing transactions that have a great cultural and strategic fit and at prices that can deliver attractive returns to our shareholders we started fiscal with very strong results and i believe we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in the coming quarters across all of our businesses but we are also fully aware that we are still in the middle of a global health pandemic and we should all be prepared for much more economic turbulence and market volatility over the next several months raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 with that operator could you please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you the first question comes from manan gosalia of morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning maybe a question on the pcg segment how should we think about the compensation ratio in that segment i know ph the risk last quarter was about basis points positive for the pretax margin but i guess when we look at the compensation in that segment it was pretty flat versus last quarter so were there any factors that are maybe masking that 100basis point improvement here paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean the biggest driver manan and good morning to you as well the biggest driver is really just the growth in the production to advisors thats going to have roughly a payout associated with it so thats going to be your biggest driver of compensation in the pcg segment as for the admin comp in the pcg segment as we said on the call last quarter we expect that to be we were expecting it to be relatively flat when we were on the call last quarter but the one driver there would be some of the benefits that grow with profitability across the firm but again we think that thats what were really focusing on managing is the admin comp in the pcg segment and thats what would be reflect that would reflect the benefit from the expense initiatives we announced last quarter manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then on the capital return front appreciate the update on how youre thinking about capital return and i realize you cant give a timeline but in the past youve mentioned times book value threshold as a level that youre looking at for doing more buybacks can you give us an update on how youre thinking about that now and would you maybe consider buying back at a higher level if the stock stays above that level in the absence of any acquisition opportunities paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah were going to later roll out a more definitive capital plan but are managing tier back to percentage over time weve committed to the million buybacks a year just to manage equitybased dilution at any price and then the other will be more opportunistic so well just have to see that out now the only caution on the opportunistic part is wed like to say were feeling much better about the economy and the pandemic and the virus being under control as people get the shots but we dont know right so well be a little cautious on that part but well be a little more opportunistic outside of that million kind of more programmatic buyback manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 got it thank you operator thank you the next question comes from devin ryan jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks good morning everyone paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc just first question here just on the recruiting commentary and outlook obviously you guys have been alluding to some increased competition in recent months so i just want to dig in a little bit because it seems like over time recruiting competition kind of ebbs and flows and so im kind of curious what do you think is driving that right now and i guess i just want to make sure that i understand this whole message here i guess my takeaway is that independent advisor recruiting is still very strong and thats the expectation on the employee side pricing has become more competitive but it sounds like raymond james will be or already is increasing kind of pricing competitiveness so should we expect that the recruiting on the employee side will remain active but just they cost a bit more or i just want to make sure im taking the right takeaway here paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc weve had a very robust recruiting history as you know and certainly on the employee side as people indiscernible the transition assistance to be more trying to grow their private client group business as we did and that gap just got bigger and bigger and bigger where i think that people even wanting to join just said the economic gap was too big and as we really analyzed it that if we can get by upping we dont have to match weve proven that over history but being more competitive because of the environment what we offer advisors we can get a good return now and if interest rate spreads gap out again in the future those recruiting deals from our standpoint will even be better so weve gotten more aggressive yeah theres a little bit of lag but we think we can get it going we did cut the advisor class going in on a cost cut and then during the pandemic and as we ramp back up the training which we expect to once we get out of as we kind of exiting the total virtual environment thatll help also so again last year we had good recruiting stats to the quarter but it isnt unusual to go back to the year before that it was flattish i think were up to a record recruiting year so well get it back on track and maybe were a little slow to act but recruiting overall has been good and then were going to have to figure out how to give you better numbers because people are in the ria channel we dont count them at all and so youre not really seeing overall recruiting although they are in the asset number raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 so were going to work on how to give you a better metric on that too so you can compare it more apples to apples these channels may shift over time devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thats really good color thank you paul and then just a followup here on capital as well appreciate the update there is there any way you can just help refresh us how to think about the capacity of the bank growth or the size of the bank within raymond james i appreciate that youre going to be opportunistic and cant really give a timeline of expanding the bank balance sheet but how should we think about based on whether its third party bank deposits and client interest program the capacity to fund growth or the size of the bank within the overall firm how are you guys thinking about maybe the upper band of capacity without giving us a timeline of exactly how youll get there paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin we would love to continue growing the bank and we have as you can see with the cash at thirdparty banks and now in cip at the brokerdealer we have a lot of funding capacity and plenty of capital capacity to grow the bank so that the biggest constraint now is just finding assets with good risk adjusted returns over a long period of time the way were thinking about balance sheet growth overall as a firm which includes primarily most of the growth in the balance sheet would come from the bank going forward is that tier leverage ratio that paul mentioned which we hope to target about around at take that ratio down to somewhere around over time now it could go under if were just accommodating client cash balances and investing it and parking it at the fed or investing it in treasuries but on a more normalized basis i think is a conservative place to be at as a holding company overall and so thats how were thinking about the bank growth some of the metrics in the past that we shared with you around percentage of equity and percentage of cash balances those were metrics that were established when were primarily a corporate loan bank essentially and so we were those metrics were intended to contain the size of the corporate the credit exposure to our overall balance sheet now that we have agency mortgagebacked securities and we have securitiesbased loans and mortgages to private client group clients some of those metrics arent as relevant as they were five years ago so that is going to be a part of the discussion that we hope to share more details with you on at our upcoming analyst investor day devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great thanks paul that was what i was getting at so appreciate it operator thank you the next question comes from craig siegenthaler of credit suisse please go ahead gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc good morning this is gautam sawant filling in for craig i just wanted to followup on the balance sheet commentary and we want to know what kind of macroeconomic greenshoots youre seeing and how are those getting you more comfortable with growing rj bank over the nearterm raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think its certainly in sectors as you know we were pretty aggressive on selling covid exposed loans and so that kind of shrunk the balance sheet a little bit those sales i mean at least relative to what it could grow but we track other kind of the noncovid related areas and how the economy has performed even in near lockdowns in places were pretty comfortable with a lot of others sectors and so those are the sectors were looking at growing weve also looked at the spread on mbs securities and theyre just not there just isnt a lot so were looking at higher grade corporate loans also to get a better spread with shorter duration which you buy at threeyear a corporate loan in a wellrun company in a noncovid segment versus a treasury that is not yielding anything so were looking were comfortable with the bank the lending team we have a lot of capacity so were as weve gone through this part of the pandemic even though theres uncertainty were getting more comfortable with lending in areas that kind of open that back up gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you operator thank you the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey steve paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hi steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey guys so i wanted to start off with a question on the capital markets outlook youre coming off a record year for fixed brokerage and whats informing your view that activity should remain elevated as it appears both you and peers are over earning in that particular area relative to history and maybe just a question for mr shoukry since you alluded to the million to million run rate which would be a good outcome for the quarterly run rate for ib should we infer from your remarks there that this base level is consistent with your view of what normalized activity looks like and what you believe is readily achievable within the ib segment in particular raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah ill answer the second part of the question first i wish it was that scientific with projecting the investment banking revenues i think it was more of just a hypothetical on a going forward basis if we kind of average million of investment banking revenues a quarter then that would sort of match the record we set last fiscal year so is there upside to that as we saw this quarter there is upside to that and we are growing the platform paul mentioned the financo acquisition which we hope will close and were also hiring a lot of other senior mds so we have a pretty powerful investment banking platform i think you saw the potential of that this quarter but we just want to caution the street against annualizing against it paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think its steve its one of the difficult things that you talk to us or you talk to peers in the industry everyone was surprised at how little fuss this quarter was i mean its not that we didnt have a good backlog so when you come off a quarter like this of activity you go well whats the next quarter look like the backlogs are very good the activity is very high but you hate to keep predicting a repeat of this quarter when its an alltime record and i think industry wide it was very strong so can it continue yes but that would be a guess too so we kind of give you numbers were comfortable with it doesnt mean we cant beat them it just means that its very hard to predict these revenues in this business and we certainly at last quarters call didnt predict this number for this quarter steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no i empathize were dealing with the same struggles paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah yeah and were i think the one thing were comfortable with and it can change overnight but i think its the fixed income market given the dynamics its been a pretty good run and the dynamics were pretty much in place and that usually wont shut off unless theres a major event but ma is still strong so its what number i dont know its just hard for us to predict so again we dont try to give you the optimistic numbers we try to be just realistic and hope we do better i certainly know the bankers are hoping to do better but its a lot of business to close paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah and then maybe a little smaller in absolute size but the debt underwriting business i think was a record this quarter as well so they finished the calendar year public finance business did in the top in the country and the pipelines there look good as well so we have a very strong public finance franchise which will also contribute to the results steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no its great and for my follow up i just want to ask a follow up relating to the organic growth outlook the discussion that took place earlier appreciate the nuanced commentary around the recruiting backdrop and some of the color around the different channels and what youre seeing you quoted an nna figure which implied about organic growth in the quarter slightly below the to youve recorded over the last year and as you look raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 ahead just given the heightened competition within the employee channel what pace of nna growth do you are you comfortable underwriting or we should be contemplating at least in the near to intermediate term given some of the competitive dynamics that you cited paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey steve ill let paul talk about the competitive dynamics but just as far as the nna metric goes we that was for the year actually the fourth quarter for almost all the firms in our industry us included was seasonally high because of the dividend and interest reinvestment so yeah quartertoquarter that number can change because as you know the baseline the beginning of the period asset rolls forward a quarter as well so were still pleased with the organic growth and remember that is net of the commission and fees in the private client group the way we count for it paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and i would say on the recruiting look weve been ive been here now almost a decade and weve had quarters where this has happened where recruiting has trailed off in different channels and weve adjusted and weve been right back as kind of a benchmark for recruiting across our channels and i believe well continue that advisers want to be here we have great tools great technology and a great culture that supports them so we just maybe got a little uncompetitive and thought during the pandemic it didnt make sense but as we really dug into the economics we had a lot of room to go up so we did go up modestly and i still think will be very good returns and we just its a hard choice for advisors when they come down to two places when someones going to pay them more so were just going to have to close that gap and still be a good economic return for the firm so theres always a lag between when you do this and when the count comes up and recruiting isnt bad in the employee channel at all its just down from kind of series of records and we just need to get it back up where it can be i mean where it should be given what we think we offer in our platform so im still very optimistic about it as its been robust in all the other channels and weve had channels go up and down before for a quarter or two and weve always rebounded well just focus on it get it back to where we think it should be steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks and i know ph i mean thats on capital but i appreciate the commitment to the tier leverage target and look forward to seeing the pathway to getting there in a few months paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc right paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc all right thanks steve operator thank you the next question comes from alex blostein of goldman sachs please go ahead raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question hey paul i was hoping you could dig into the ria and the custody platform a little bit more i guess one can you give us a sense for the assets on that platform now and how much thats been contributing to you guys nnas over the last year and slightly bigger picture what is sort of the key competitive advantage that you think differentiates you guys versus peers in this part of the market and from an economics perspective i guess how should we be thinking about the revenue yield or the operating income yield on those assets sort of aside from the cash related revenues i mean obviously thats one but are there other fees and things like that that we should contemplate as part of the business grows paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so theres its a complex and multiple asset multiple faceted answer and we plan again on investor day to try to give better metrics because we arent disclosing all that at current but youre in general in that custody type of platform the return on assets may be a little lower and the margins are higher but youre calculating it on a different revenue stream so its a little bit complex there and traditionally in that business a lot of it was trading fees which have gone away and interest spreads which are hopefully temporary gone away so the economics in that business with interest spreads are a little more challenged but i think theyre fairly compelling when you get it back our platform the competitive part of our platform is that as an ria custodian not only do we have a firm with an investment grade background which makes us a great competitor but we also can offer kind of full systems platforms and others that other firms use thirdparty platform so our goal would be to allow our platforms to be used for people who want the turnkey as well as integrating thirdparty platforms and also access to our other services such as lending and other things that we do through our bank and access to the other help that we give and through our support centers which i think are much more robust than most ria platforms so i think its a strong alternative weve shown growth weve been in a while we just talked about it less and weve seen both with the market is trading fees have gone away as regulation and best interests for some of the larger advisors that felt it was just easier to be under the kind of the sec versus finra and some of all the rules and they could take on the compliance and risk have chosen to do that and so i think its a longterm trend its been a longterm trend its just picking up for certain advisors and i think well be competitive in that platform too we just we got a lot of growth ahead of us to get us some scale there but so far so good alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great and then my followup is around expenses and paul you gave kind of updated thoughts around the comp rate and again hopefully it could be better than with the robust capital markets backdrop but can you talk a little bit about the noncomp outlook maybe excluding provision expenses you guys have been running at a little bit over million this quarter and last quarter on those kind of combination of those lines again excluding credit provisions how do you guys envision that evolving through the rest of the fiscal year and i guess to what extent sort of the higher recruiting ta packages will push that number higher just trying to get some sort of framework to think about it for the rest of the year thanks paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 yeah i dont think the higher ta packages would really move the needle throughout the year and that shows up in compensation when it starts amortizing not the noncomp line item so were at around million this quarter which is sort of what we were guiding around and that included some nci expense as well the only thing that is harder to project is what business development expenses are going to do throughout the year theyre down yearoveryear almost million for the quarter so well see how business travel recovers as we progress throughout the calendar year but overall were really focused as you can tell on managing all of the noncomp line items some of them grow naturally with business growth subadvisory fees grow with feebased assets in pcg for example and those were up sequentially so youre going to see some natural growth but the ones that are controllable are the ones that were really focused on managing paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think in the shorter term they will be wellmanaged the question becomes when the environment opens up for conferences and others youre going to get some rise but short term this quarter we certainly dont have any conferences scheduled and i dont know when that opens up some people would say late summer my guess is itll take a while before people are comfortable with traveling and gathering so it might be next calendar year before you really see anything there so theyre still well managed were managing them very closely as part of it and plan to do that but we will add people with growth i mean you recruit an advisor youve got to hire an assistant youve got you recruit advisors youve got rent youve got theres just things if you open a branch but the kind of discretionary stuff were holding pretty tightly paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah and maybe one other comment that paul just reminded me of is this first calendar quarter has some seasonal factors to it its a shorter number of days so that impacts your interest billings we already talked about the impact to asset management billings theres payroll tax reset in the first calendar quarter across the board usually of higher mailings which for us shows up in the communication information processing so theres some shortterm seasonal things from quartertoquarter but kind of echoing pauls comments on the management of the ones we can control alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks very much operator thank you the next question comes from chris harris wells fargo please go ahead christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks guys another one on the competitive environment for advisors how does what youre seeing in the marketplace today compare to history is this about as competitive as youve seen it or not necessarily more like middle of the road i guess thats the first part of the question and then second part of the question is are you a little surprised about how competitive its getting given where interest rates are raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so the first question is its always been competitive its always been very competitive weve always had well we always had outliers one or two people offering larger pack kind of outsized packages ph we viewed to economics so its gotten a little more broadbased as some of the regional firms have joined into the fray so its a little more competitive in that area i do think when we really dug into the economics that even though it was like packages we thought with this interest rate environment made no sense if you structure them right we believe you can get a good return and if spreads do come back therell be very very good investments in those recruiting packages so we always kind of modeled our returns to current environment or we are conservative only at high spreads assuming theyre going back to normal or historical averages in our packages we were assuming they just stayed more like where they are now which i think was probably over punitive so were a little behind we had room to increase it and well do fine in the competitives its always been competitive weve always recruited people that had better higher offers at other firms and weve been very successful so would we lose some people because of it yeah we just felt that we got a little out of the market in the last couple of quarters so well correct it and therell still be a good return for the firm and the other channels have been doing fine we had it in one channel but we had this happen in other channels and had to make adjustments and rebounded so this whole business is always competitive weve never had an easy road right so christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc well you guys make it look easy so we sometimes forget about that paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc quick followup for paul shoukry you highlighted a bit more downside to the nim as we progress through the fiscal year im guessing thats all coming from the afs portfolio once we get sort of towards the end of the fiscal year is it fair to say that that were probably close to bottoming on the nim based on where interest rates are today paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah and youre right chris it is really mostly almost all of it is the agency mortgage backed securities portfolio we had paper paying off and as people are refinancing their mortgages youre seeing prepayment speeds accelerate and right now with the fed buying i think billion a month is what they committed recommitted to yesterday the spreads now are really tight i mean were talking about basis points or so for three years of duration raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 can you see that youre ph getting really paid a lot to take that three years of duration so but you just do the math on that thats where if rates dont change for the next year or two thats where the yield on that portfolio would bottom out assuming things dont improve in terms of the yield for the securities portfolio which is why we decelerated the growth of that this quarter and plan on the nearterm sort of running in place with that portfolio until we see maybe some improvement in those spreads christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks guys operator thank you the next question comes from jim mitchell seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey hey good morning guys maybe we could dig into a little bit the ma business its been obviously its been an area of focus and investment and obviously big surprise strength this quarter can you give us some metrics that we can kind of think about number of mds the growth rate in mds how to think about what is driving the growth and how we can at least model it a little bit better paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc weve historically tried all sorts of things we hold in underwriting a number of mds i think theres a number of factors that jim bunn our current head has just done a fantastic job of recruiting and developing mds that are even existing ones are producing or doing deals at levels we never thought that they could do three years ago and we have teams in segments that are just key players and compete against anybody of any size in their verticals so we hope financo which was an industry leading in their consumer area will do the same and so were hes been building out vertical by vertical and globally certain sectors so its not just mds its really the production of those mds and the size of deals and everything thats driving that so every time we give a metric over time it hasnt really tracked so wed be open and maybe we ought to look at what other disclosures are to see if theres any information that we could give you but we cant find a metric especially over quarters because its a cyclical business to some extent that would give you a good indication so weve tried it in the past well think about it and try again because if we could find the metric wed give it to you james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities well i would say md head count growth does have a pretty high correlation with longterm growth in advisory fees so that could be helpful but i appreciate it maybe turning to the comp ratio now paul when you talk about or lower is that sort of assuming that kind of average quarterly run rate in investment banking how do we think about that target for the year versus the in the first quarter are you assuming that in your numbers or youre just sort of assuming on a average basis that million to million paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 yeah i think thats the primary driver is just the capital markets revenue mix if you think about it our asset management fees growing next quarter in the private client group business that will have somewhere around a payoff associated with it james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities sure paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc so even if the capital markets segment generated the same revenues next quarter as it did this quarter which were not expecting at this juncture then our comp ratio would go up so its just based on the revenue growth in the private client group business so its based on revenue mix and the biggest driver of the upside or i guess in this case the downside in terms of being below would be very very strong capital markets revenues james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay all right thanks operator thank you the next question comes from kyle voigt kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thank you most of my questions have been asked and answered i guess maybe a followup for paul you just spoke about the agency book and agency deals i was just wondering if theres any color you could provide on how much more pressure we should expect on the resi loan yields for the remainder of the year just given that its been drifting lower as well paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc weve seen a lot of refi activity there which frankly is good for our clients theyre taking advantage of the lower rate environment so i think youd see a little bit more continued pressure there but certainly not to the same extent as the agency mortgagebacked securities and with this the nim compression in those two categories as paul said earlier were also focused on opportunistically growing the corporate loan portfolio so i think our focus is growing net interest income through asset growth to offset the nim compression going forward thats kind of the way were thinking about the banks balance sheet kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc the good news right now is that were with our capital position and our liquidity position here we got a lot of flexibility so were looking were a growth company were looking at we certainly came through what we hope is the worst of the pandemic in great shape and its were feeling more comfortable looking forward we plan to raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 grow in the bank almost all the segments i mean the sbl segment certainly is a great asset for clients and a good asset for us the mortgage market i think looks like its kind of bottomed out so hopefully that will continue to grow and get good spreads and were feeling more comfortable with the corporate side again so were feeling a lot better than we were this time last year or i guess march of last year paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah were feeling really good this time last year kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator thank you and our final question comes from bill katz citigroup please go ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking the question this morning so just going back to maybe ma broadly you had mentioned that over time youd sort of put out million plus of earnouts related to the two deals i was wondering if you could help us understand how to think through maybe some of the earnings accretion or an roe type of construct against that payout thats the first question paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so the first thing is as youve been around us long enough to know is that we dont do things for shortterm accretion right we do and were not aggressive in even how we account for any of it so we do these projects really because of longterm growth and we think theyll come and i remember even getting back into morgan keegan and others that weve been similar weve done things that we think are structured well theyre longterm growth all of these kind of acquisitions have some intangibles that go against pl some of they all have usually transitional comp they have things that in the shortterm dont have big impacts but longer term theyve had great impacts and i think thats how you would look at those two deals right now but were very very high on both of them but i wouldnt say theyre shortterm going to have any kind of major accretion impact william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful and then just within that second question just in terms of ma big picture and i appreciate the discussion on capital management and q1 levels etcetera how are you thinking about like priorities from here theres been some interesting ma by some of your peers and sort of wondering how youre thinking about what areas of focus from here whether it be asset management or scaling further into private client business thank you paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i dont think our priorities have changed so we are looking at both private client group is our biggest business weve looked at acquisitions as weve said both in private client but there arent a lot that really fit so raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28jan2021 organic recruiting has been the engine thats driven and if you look back even to the engine thats driven has been organic recruiting not some of the really good acquisitions weve done in that area we are in the ma area we continue to talk to folks and without the cultural fit or some of the deal prices weve walked from some things i mean these arent the only two deals weve looked at and the third area that i think were spending more focus on are things like our plan administrator who is taking businesses we do today and helping to monetize them and give great service to our clients and advisors and weve done that in the insurance area with ph peoples choice weve done that now with nwps and we plan to keep looking at areas like that that use technology and service and practices to both create a service and a value to clients and a value to us so theres a lot of things we looked at also in the technology area now today but were very deliberate but were very very active and so we plan to hopefully we would like to do more than weve done but they have to fit and they have to work so were going to continue on the course weve been on and hopefully deploy some more capital william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i dont think we have any more questions then paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well great well i appreciate you all joining us on the call and certainly a strong quarter for us and again were very optimistic in terms of the fundamentals i dont know what will happen with the market but hopefully this pandemic gets behind us and we feel in good shape at raymond james so and just remember that weve i will sure remind you that our area is the home of not just the stanley cup champions the baseball runner up so almost world series champions but hopefully the football champions too at raymond james stadium where theyre playing for the nfl championship so thank you operator thank you that does conclude the conference call for today we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines thank you and have a good day raymond james financial inc rjf corrected
