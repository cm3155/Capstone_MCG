consumerbased products services and experiences in june we were the first major bank to announce the elimination of overdraft fees for all customers while eliminating the revenue stream was viewed by

the significant role these efforts have played in building a stronger company lets turn to slide number where ill touch on a few highlights from second quarter adjusted eps of core rotce of and revenues of billion each represented recordsetting levels for ally driven by ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 organic revenue expansion and strong credit trends while a favorable backdrop across consumer and auto markets accentuated financial results during the quarter its important to recognize the underlying drivers of allys broader performance first as youve heard from us on several occasions results of this magnitude reflect years of disciplined execution and our adaptability and creativity has enhanced our ability to capitalize on market opportunities in real time second and critically important is that meaningful expansion opportunities remain ahead for ally as we continue to grow our company and unlock incremental value within auto insurance and ally bank these dynamics serve as the cornerstones of our long term operational and financial expansion which we steadily delivered against over the past several years jenn will provide more detail that we expect full year performance to exceed normalized returns while our long term outlook for sustainable rotce profile in the solid midteens represents our strongest level as a publicly traded company performance will be driven by ongoing core earnings expansion fueled by robust dealer engagement and deepened customer relationships across our digital bank offerings our continued progress allowed us to announce a expansion to our share buyback program and increase our dividend for the sixth time in as many years disciplined capital management in accordance with the scv regulatory framework is a continuous part of our focus turning to our business performance within auto consumer originations of billion represented our highest level in years at a solid yield we focus on being the preeminent dealer partner evidenced in the record million applications we decisioned this quarter and with a pathway for further expansion as we deepen relationships across our dealers for the first time in our history credit for the quarter was a net recovery reflecting the resilience of the auto asset class including strong consumer demand broad strength and health among consumers including the benefits of meaningful fiscal and monetary actions and our focused and modernized approach to underwriting and collections credit trends remain encouraging reducing the likelihood of protracted elevated losses as the gradual migration back to more normalized levels becomes more likely over the next to months importantly we use this time to further enhance our ability to reach our auto customers through expanded digital channels coupled with enhanced analytics within our servicing teams we constantly monitor broader market indicators of consumer health including wage and price inflation employment conditions and productivity measures while there are several crosscurrents today i remain of the view that consumers are wellpositioned with healthy balance sheets increasing their willingness and ability to borrow and pay auto sector competition remained intense but balanced overall as vehicle sales were robust particularly for non fleet retail sales strong demand continued to outpace oem production pushing industry inventories to multi decade lows which in turn is providing structural support for used values we expect floorplan balances to remain low and used values elevated for some time before beginning to steadily migrate towards more normalized levels based on what we see today and in conversations we have with the dealer community this will take us into next year within insurance written premiums of million reflected our highest second quarter of consumer volume driven by increased market share and strong vehicle sales investment

car values ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity and higher ally lending debt balances at attractive yields these dynamics largely offset prepayment activity in mortgage and lower floorplan balances stemming from robust consumer demand and continued supply chain constraints we expect full year retail auto origination yields in the range and now expect used car values to rise in the mid to upper range yearoveryear ph at the mid30 rise during the first half of an outlook that contemplates more normalized pricing and a substantial rise in car values that began in the latter part of last year impacts from elevated used car values have been partly offset by higher liquidity levels and premium amortization trends we expect to normalize over time turning to liabilities cost of funds improved basis points the eighth consecutive quarteroverquarter decline as youve heard from us before our interest rate risk position is relatively neutral and we remain confident in our ability to thrive in both higher and lower rate environments given our balance sheet positioning while we continue to prefer a steeper curve we are not overly dependent on rates to drive margin improvement allys

environment as we expanded volumes and units average commercial balances ended at billion as industry inventories reached a 36year low the floorplan contraction has been driven by strong consumer

multiproduct relationships the path to billion in annual dtc volume over the next couple of years remains within reach even as the broader market is expected to decline as we build scale through existing and new customers on slide weve refreshed the financial outlook given our strong results we now expect rotce in the range for this year excluding the impact of reserve release activity performance will be fueled by plus year overyear total revenue growth and operating leverage gains in the midteens range ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 the chart also demonstrates the significant longterm momentum weve generated across the company evidenced in the sustainable plus return profile ongoing results will be fueled by revenuedriven ppnr expansion nii will reflect the loan growth and net interest margin in the mid to upper range steadily expanding other revenues will result organic growth from our established and broadend consumer

i remain deeply grateful and proud to lead our company our results this quarter are really impressive but our broader purpose and calls to serve our teammates our customers our communities and our

lines and balance sheet optimization this positions us for a long term outlook which is brighter now than at any other point in our companys history we will continue to execute with the focus on the same values and priorities that have served us well and the futures bright for all things ally so daniel with that turn it back to you and we can head into qa daniel eller headinvestor relations ally financial inc right thanks jb so as we head into the qa session ill remind participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up operator you may now tee up the qa session ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan nash from goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so jb jenn maybe talk about how you can manage through the normalization of used car prices via underwriting and maybe just talk about what assumptions are baked into your intermediate term net interest margin guidance and sorry can maybe you could just talk about what youre seeing in smart option in terms of lease gains are you starting to see any signs of normalization and what are your expectations as you look out over the next to months jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure good morning ryan so just a couple of comments on where we are with used car prices we can get into some of the dynamics on smart option but clearly first half of this year used vehicle pricing is up kind of over and in second quarter up over we are expecting ryan for used car pricing to start to normalize in the back half of this year now i think the question is around the pacing of that we do think weve kind of passed the peak and we would migrate down to more normalized levels at a minimum by and thats what is embedded in our kind of mediumterm guidance around 15plus percent rotce i think a lot of dynamics there and we hit on these in the prepared remarks but were continuing to see incredibly strong demand for personal vehicle ownership we actually think some of that could be pushed out simply because of availability of new and used vehicles coupled with on the supply side weve seen the chip shortage is going to continue to pressure inventory levels ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 and so while we are expecting the normalization i think the big question ryan is quite frankly when will that happen i think you know us we tend to be pretty conservative in how we model this and we are expecting it to come down at least in our modeled numbers through and on your question on underwriting look we never change underwriting for pockets of abnormal activity and so we have embedded normalized used vehicle pricing and lgd and offlease as well in underwriting for both lease and lending so we feel really good about our pricing approach obviously our reserves include much more normalized levels and then on smart option not as not quite as many cars as we would have liked we are seeing kind of dealer buyouts increase simply because of the demand for inventory on lots and their appetite to sell metal so were not seeing quite the activity wed like to on smart options but the gains are coming in just huge as we saw in q2 and then will be modest in terms of assumption here on out ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe if i can ask one follow up i mean the business is obviously generating outstanding returns right now youre talking about plus this year youre benefiting from elevated used car prices so jb can you maybe just talk about your prioritization in terms of how you think about accelerating investments in some of the new businesses that can drive revenue growth versus potentially accelerating capital repatriation youve obviously increased the dividend by a decent chunk and youre going to be buying back billion of stock versus over the next year but im just curious how you think about that relative tradeoff of accelerating some investments given the outsized profits versus continuing to return a lot of capital to shareholders thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah thats a great question ryan and i guess its a blend of both for us right now so as you pointed out we were really happy to be able to announce higher capital returns the dividend and buybacks and even having said that were still running elevated levels of capital i think the cet1 is still basis points higher and thats a real amount of dollars than our internal target that we want to run so going into this years planning process jenn and i are really working with our business leaders on trying to think through what were calling kind of unconstrained growth so what are the higher growth scenarios that we could deploy to drive better organic levels both in terms of balance sheet and revenue opportunities i think we continue to be very tactical in what were doing on the technology side the digital side the cyber investment side those are some of the nearterm investments what jenn and i have green lighted to accelerate and then also the same thing on the brand side well ally bank brand and the ally brand overall continues to resonate extremely well i think relative to some of our competitors we are underspent there we are underinvested there and we think theres broader opportunities and promoting the brand doing more and digital acceleration with the brand we have a great chief marketing officer in andrea brimmer and shes got some worldclass teammates that are trying to really push forward what we do in the digital analytics side there so were super excited and i think its going to be a fun year i think the board is on board with us and kind of pushing the company forward so were ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 proud of the foundation thats been established but i think now its really about pushing for even higher levels than weve achieved to date so hopefully thats helpful ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah thats great thanks for all the color jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc got it jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you ryan operator thank you our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani from kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning and good quarter things are really solid and just a quick question on the originations obviously very strong quarter originations could you just speak to how you see that unfolding for the remainder of the year jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure good morning sanjay and thank you for the question so our originations approach billion this quarter and it sets us up really nicely for a full year originations were expecting strong flows through q3 and q4 and likely will exceed billion we always talk about our strategy is not to chase volume but well be opportunistic when we see it and we are certainly seeing it this year evidenced in kind of the strongest originations weve seen in years and we continue to see opportunities to hit that kind of retail auto origination yield in as well so think about kind of sanjay a number in the billion to billion and then well continue to see how things unfold into and again no new volume targets but with our rapidly expanding distribution jb mentioned its our 29th quarter consecutively of growing dealers and then the team is all over relationship deepening right now so we hit record application flows were not seeing any sign of that stopping based on the operating environment but more specifically just our strategic positioning across our dealer base and our product set right now sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then i guess the follow question to ryan just a question on capital i guess when we think about the excess capital some of it could be used towards ma are there any opportunities out there that youre seeing is there a pipeline of things are contemplating thanks ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sanjay id say we always try to stay opportunistic and open i think the position we find ourselves in today though is weve got dominant franchises in auto and the bank and were seeing all these new businesses really start to grow and scale on top of what auto continues to do so were in this fortunate position where we dont feel force to have to do anything and i think thats probably different than some of our banking competitors and so well always stay open the ally lending business is obviously new were impressed with leadership there the way theyve integrated into ally and the scalability of that business but and thats an entree into this universe of unsecured consumer lending i think theres still a broader question is there something bigger should we accelerate what were doing there do we have a broader opportunity but were just we find ourselves in a really great position today as the business the business model has been validated so were not in a rush or a race to do anything sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks sanjay operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning can you give a bit more color on your discussions with your dealers around floorplan levels and the possibility that theyll be able to run with less inventory and also if you could remind us what kind of impact smaller dealer floorplan balances will have on allys profitability jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure good morning bill maybe ill start with the dealer floorplan impacts and we can trickle back to the dealer question but on floorplan i mean obviously thats impacting our balance sheet and weve continued to see loans in the commercial space dip down and we think weve hit the trough here in the second quarter we could kind of bounced around at these levels for another couple of months but we do expect kind of back half of this year to see a commercial start to grow again and normalize kind of through it is going to take some time no doubt especially with continued strong consumer demand and then supply chain shortages just from chips as well as other constraints so expecting to see that turn around a bit towards the back half of this year but its going to be a slow kind of and steady recovery ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 i think whats great for ally is that we have natural hedges and with the lighter floorplan youre seeing used vehicle values continue to climb we had kind of 40pluspercent in the second quarter were expecting to increase in used vehicle values thats obviously showing up in our lease yields through slower depreciation as well as lease gains and its also showing up in our loss given default from a loss perspective were in a net recovery position this quarter as youve seen so the natural hedges offset the balance sheet decreases that weve seen on the floorplan side and netnet set us up to generate really robust returns and earnings and quite frankly its the same for our dealers theyre seeing margin expansion were hitting kind of record numbers of dealers that are profitable right now due to some of these dynamics on the inventory side lower carry costs high vehicle values in terms of kind of their views on where we are i think the sentiment and jb can add on but the sentiment is this is going to take some time and i think because dealer profitability is still high there is no rush to kind of to increase inventory increase carry cost i think there has been some smart learnings that have come out of this and it always makes sense to build for demand as opposed to build supply and hope the demand comes and so were hopeful that the oems as well as the dealers will continue to take some of these lessons learned into future operational practices but jb anything youd add to that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay thank you as a follow up i wanted to ask about branding you guys have had tremendous success with the build out of the deposit franchise but is there an active focus on doing more to continue to develop the ally brand inside the organization with the goal of just ultimately being seen as more than beyond the provider of a balance sheet jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah bill do you have a direct line to andrea indiscernible jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean in fact we are as jb mentioned we are in active dialog right now were launching our strategic planning process and were in active dialog around how we can continue to be thoughtful share the ally story with our customers we have a terrific product set across both sides of the balance sheet adding to our wealth management capabilities so we think theres just terrific opportunity ahead to accelerate the growth of our new businesses and to continue to dominate across auto and deposits so absolutely and i can kind of hear andrea cheering from a couple floors down around us now of course we want to do it smartly and we want to make sure that we position the brand effectively just being mindful of generating positive operating leverage but with that said we would agree jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 yeah indiscernible just to add on a little bit there too as i mean today weve got ballpark around numbers million customers i think the unique thing for us is theyre active theyre engaged were growing the multiproduct nature of the customer base as well so its all about what were really trying to optimize if we wanted the higher headline customer number we could target for that but i think whats been very important and whats been guiding us is get a customer in the door grow around them help them see the holistic nature of the brand i mean were very proud of using a subset of the customer base million at the bank i mean to see a retention rate on our customer base this is something about our brand and the quality of our service but as jim pointed out andrea is always looking to grow and optimize and our new advertisements promote kind of the holistic nature of ally so youll see more from us obviously we continue to grow our sports marketing footprint and what weve done on the ph champions tour with womens soccer with mls coming and then obviously a really dominant position in nascar today we think the sports marketing approach also drives pretty incredible brand value there as well so bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful thank you for taking my questions jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes in the line of john hecht from jefferies your line is now open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a solid quarter the most of my questions were around residual values and you guys have addressed those so i guess one thing is its i think back in you kind of gave us an indication of kind of i think it was like a yearoveryear decline in residual values or used car pricing to kind of give us just a sense where your heads at and how youre resetting your depreciation curve and so forth do you have anything thats that straightforward for us thinking about and where you might be kind of pinpointing expected residual value declines jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so good morning john so let me start with this year so we are expecting this year to land kind of up to high range the first half of this year is up or so above and so we are expecting the back half to start to normalize and without getting too specific around kind of and numbers which is a lot to work through to have a clear view but by what weve modeled in our guide is that we do get back to kind of a much more normalized lease yield so we always talked about kind of to pregains and then add another percent or so for gains and so we do expect to get back to that much more normalized yield by ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 now as i mentioned there is definitely a bull case out there just as we look at continued demand for vehicles as well as the supply shortages but we dont model in any kind of extraordinary results into the guide we have much more normalized projections john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats super helpful appreciate that jenn and then jb thinking about that you guys had a lot of applications and thinking about your conversion rate and maybe just sort of commentary on what you see going on in terms of underwriting quality across the industry as banks may be coming back into the fray and how you guys respond from a competitive perspective jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah so i mean its been overall pretty balanced competition i mean the market as weve seen for quite some time has been intense i think as weve probably talked about for a year or so theres been rumors of players coming back in but it really hasnt disrupted flow or competition or things that we see or certainly any of the pricing dynamics i mean if you look at some of our pages in the deck some of the supplemental financial information we havent really changed anything on underwriting standards weve kind of been running the same type of fico trend same type of focus on our ph sa tiers of business because were generating really really solid returns there i mean when you think about were now at probably quarters or so of run in this 7plus yield in a practically zero rate environment with very low or benign credit costs i mean this is pretty chunky so we probably would have expected a little bit more competition that were seeing but frankly weve made it really easy to work with the dealers the dealers know what our buy box is they know were not inconsistent in that and so part of just having established relationships with dealers just leads to a really attractive originations overall and really attractive yields where were booking so id just say i dont mean to sound boring its just its always a competitive market but there havent been really any big shifts in the universe in which we play in bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc appreciate that thanks guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just had a couple of questions i wanted to ask about the capacity of the current balance sheet to add more loans i know youve been growing loans at a nice steady clip youve got a lot of capital generation but im just wondering from a liquidity perspective do you feel like youre optimized for that or is there room to kind of burn down some of that liquidity to add incremental lending jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah hey betsy so on your first question resounding yes and really across all of our lending categories that youve seen us grow consumer retail auto kind of sequentially for the last several quarters and you see the robust cash flow origination flow and were absolutely focused on continuing to grow our retail auto lending lease as well continues to be a strong point and we dont see any sign of that stopping ally lending is really just getting started so you saw we almost hit million in originations were well on our way to get to a couple billion in that business and in short order we hit our highest level of originations in our directtoconsumer mortgage portfolio so were well on our way we kind of hit billion or so in originations this year its climbed up to billion from here on out corporate finance continues to be steady growth engine wed expect that to get to about billion so i mean across the board we see opportunities to grow every one of our loan portfolios and thats part of the nii guide its nim expansion but its also growth in the balance sheet and growth across all of our businesses and then on liquidity yeah the short answer there is yes as well theres still room to optimize were sitting with excess cash that we plan to burn through through the growth of our loan portfolios but also through liability management youve seen us continue to be proactive were at deposit funded but we think that can go higher and were naturally running down our broker deposits as well as fhlb and some unsecured and secured debt so just continuing to take down that cash over time which will help with that nim trajectory as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc so daniel is clarifying the ally lending is billion is annual so sorry about that annual billion not quarterly ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and the outlook that you were giving there thats the timeframe around those kind of opportunities that youre citing is that a next month kind of outlook or is that something longer than that jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah its over time i mean we are but i did hit on commercial floorplan i hit on that earlier in the call but that thats the big question mark for us in terms of how quickly that kind of starts to grow from here but my comments are really over kind of the next to months betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great right thank you very much jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you betsy operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch from credit suisse your line is now open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hi great thanks looking at the big increase in originations the biggest is what you call the growth channel which went from to so it kind of accounted for i dont know well over billion of growth yearover year can you talk about whats driving that is it the partnerships that youve got with some of the newer type players or any other kind of insights that you can give us there jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah hey moshe its really all of the above its definitely the growing partnerships we have and weve talked at length about carvana that continues to be a very robust relationship but theres many others in that category as well as just focusing on diversified more traditional dealers that have added to that growth channel as well thats been a deliberate strategy that weve had to diversify access to applications diversify our customer base and we just continue to see really strong success across all types of dealerships moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and im struck jenn by a comment that you made earlier in your prepared remarks about kind of taking steps i think given the strong earnings now and obviously some of these things will moderate and as you pointed out about the dealer floor plan some of them will get better as you go forward but could you talk a little bit more youve talked about higher levels of capital return but can you talk about other steps to optimize whether its balance sheet structure or other pieces of the pl or other types of kind of economies of scale that we could see generating better sustained returns over time ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah sure i mean i talked a lot about the optimization that weve delivered and were not done with that right so the conversation we just had on retail auto were going to continue to diversify our customer base continue to increase access to applications and drive strong originations and riskadjusted returns and so kind of the retail auto story is to be continued and we see a lot more opportunity there in the traditional loan and lease categories but also in insurance smart option our direct lending platform clearlane indiscernible so a lot of opportunity to continue to optimize with risk adjusted returns within kind of the four walls of auto and insurance and then outside of that we talk a lot about liability optimization thats been just a terrific growth that weve had in deposit customers weve built loyalty with them strong retention and weve been able to take down the cost of funds eight consecutive quarters and weve got at least that to come in terms of continuing to take down deposit costs we have some kind of billion in cds that are rolling off this year at over basis points and much of thats rolling into a basis point osa product so a lot of room just kind of within the four walls of deposits to continue to optimize and then theres a mix component here as well as we continue to increase the percent of our liabilities coming from deposits so lots there still to come and on many of our newer businesses were just starting to accelerate up the j curve were seeing accretive returns in mortgage were getting there quickly in ally lending invest is going to take some time but we like the synergies across kind of the savings and invest platform so really just getting started in terms of the optimization of our newer businesses and then moshe last but not least on capital deployment i think whats clearly is as you can see just a robust trajectory we have ahead from organic growth and so we dont need to be in hurry to deploy that capital we can be patient we have a great earnings forecast we will be opportunistic on ma and then under the scb framework we can continue to look for ways to optimize our capital and our capital deployment and with share buybacks we had a big increase based on where i believe our stock price is going we have an incredibly return from those buybacks and so well continue to look for additional ways to deliver value through a buyback program so hopefully that gives you some color but in many ways moshe we are just getting started with optimization its obviously a lot completed but a lot more to come daniel eller headinvestor relations
