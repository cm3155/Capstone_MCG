third quarter financial results we continued to reach and serve more partners and customers new accounts grew to million and average active accounts increased to million during the period this is in large part attributable to the powerful combination of our datadriven insights our seamless customer experiences and our industryleading product suite which resonates deeply with customers synchronys omnichannel capabilities enable our partners and customers to connect wherever and whenever they want to be met and the variety of financing options and value propositions we offer empowers them with choice as we continue to anticipate and deliver on the needs of our partners and customers we drive more value and greater utilization and this translated to an increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and growth in total purchase volume compared to last year of course this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions leading to a increase in loans including loans held for sale net interest margin of was basis points higher than last year primarily reflecting the reduction in excess liquidity operating expenses were down compared to last year and down yeartodate as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned we remain on track to reduce about million from our expense base by yearend even as we continue to invest in our business the efficiency ratio was for the quarter largely flat with last year credit continued to perform very well net chargeoffs were for the third quarter down basis points from last year net earnings were billion or per diluted share and included a benefit from the reserve release related to the reclassification of the gap portfolio to held for sale turning to our balance sheet deposits were down billion or versus last year reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity deposits represented of our funding mix at quarterend a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt during the quarter weve returned billion in capital through share repurchases of billion and million in common stock dividends we also continued to reinvest in our business as we highlighted during our recent investor day our ability to remain nimble and adapt to the everchanging consumer finance landscape has been driven by our continued investment in our product suite and our innovative digital capabilities in fact if you think about the last decade alone the introduction of digital wallets pointofsale financing and a greater variety of installment offerings just to name a few has demonstrated the importance of diversity accessibility and utility in both products and experience and so synchrony has continuously evolved adding new financing options enhancing our technology platform and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all in addition to launching new products and partner programs we are remaining focused on innovative ways

customers top of wallet spend and which should drive highly scalable growth and aboveaverage returns to our business over the long term and with that ill turn the call over to brian brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys third quarter financial results reflected broadbased strength across our business highlighted by a doubledigit purchase volume increase and continued long growth a significant improvement in our net interest margin historically low losses and delinquencies and continued cost discipline the combination of these results led to billion in net earnings or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of these results are a true testament to the power of synchronys unique business model which builds on our deep domain expertise in consumer lending and leverages dynamic digital capabilities moving through our comprehensive multiproduct suite to reach and serve deep and diverse universe of partners and customers looking at our third quarter performance in greater detail beginning with purchase volume which grew compared to last year and compared to excluding walmart demonstrates clear broadbased strength in consumer demand this has also reflected in our purchase volume per count which increased compared to last year dual card and cobranded cards accounted for of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased from the prior year on a loan receivable basis excluding the impact of the reclassification of the gap portfolio to held for sale dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the portfolio and increased from the prior year average active accounts increased compared to last year and new accounts increased totaling more than million new accounts in the third quarter and over million new accounts yeartodate in late august we reached an agreement to for the sale of the gap portfolio which led to the reclassification of billion of loan receivables to held for sale and therefore reduced our ending loan receivables balance excluding the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 impact of the reclassification loan receivables would have increased by versus the prior year as the periods strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate payment rate for the third quarter was approximately basis points higher when compared to last year interest and fees on loans increased compared to last year reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables net interest income was higher than last year primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates rsas were billion in the third quarter and of average receivables the million yearoveryear increase primarily reflected the impact of the lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including growth and improvement in net interest income to put this in context remember that rsas are designed to align interest between ourselves and each of our partners this means driving growth at attractive riskadjusted returns enhancing program profitability this allows each partner to share in the progress performance so when profitability expands our partners participate in that upside so now when you think about the combined billion yearoveryear improvement in net interest income net losses and the reserve change we share million of that through the rsa focusing on our credit performance provision for losses was million included in this quarters provision was a reserve release of million which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance a more optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our gap portfolio loan receivables to held for sale this resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately million other income decreased million generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter other expense decreased compared to the prior year as you recall last year we recognized an million restructuring charge and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses moving to slide on our platform results we saw broadbased purchase volume growth across all five platforms reflecting strong consumer demand our home auto diversified value digital and health wellness platforms each experienced doubledigit yearoveryear growth in purchase volume the yearoveryear increase in home auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals while purchase volume in diversified value increased reflecting the continued return to inperson retail experiences in digital the increase was due to broadbased growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new progress with verizon and venmo in health wellness the growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures meanwhile purchase volume grew a more modest in lifestyle reflecting broadbased growth across the platform but having a tough comparable to last years strong growth in power sports loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected modest growth rate versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates the one exception being in our diversified value platform which was impacted by store closures in average active account trends range on a platform basis up by as much as in diversified value and in digital while home auto and health wellness average active accounts were generally flat the active account growth in diversified value largely reflected the return to instore retail experiences digital active accounts were up versus prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base as well as the impact of recent program launches interest and fee trends were generally improved across the platform with the exception of diversified value which was down due to lower receivables ill move to slide to discuss net interest income and margin trends the cumulative savings by consumers resulted from stimulus forbearance and lower discretionary spending continued to impact the payment rates synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 during the third quarter payment rates were approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear historical average that said weve begun to see some signs of moderation in certain cohorts as payment rate was about basis points higher yearoveryear compared to almost basis point higher yearoveryear comparison in the second quarter we expect the payment rate to gradually normalize as consumer spending remains robust excess savings have peaked and widespread forbearance dissipates interest and fees were up approximately in the third quarter reflecting average loan receivable growth net interest income increased from last year reflecting the yearoveryear improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period and interest margin was compared to last years margin of a basis point improvement yearoveryear driven by the mix of interest earning asset and favorable interestbearing liabilities cost more specifically the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning asset increased by basis points from to driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter this accounted for basis point increase in our net interest margin interestbearing liabilities costs were a yearoveryear improvement of basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rate and funding mix this provided a basis point increase in our net interest margin the loan receivables yield was a yearoveryear improvement of basis points this resulted in an basis point improvement in our net interest margin next ill cover key credit trends on slide first lets discuss our delinquency trends where higher payment trends have continued to drive yearoveryear improvements our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year our plus delinquency rate was compared to last year it should be noted that removing the impact of the gap program from the third quarters of this year and last year the 30plus delinquency metric would have been down about basis points versus basis point and the 90plus metric would be down about basis point instead of basis points and in terms of our portfolios loss performance our net chargeoff rate was compared to last year this yearoveryear improvement was primarily driven by strong delinquency trends weve experienced our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was lets move to slide and discuss expenses overall expenses were down million or from last year to million primarily reflecting the impact of the prior years restructuring charge of million and lower operational losses the efficiency ratio for the third quarter was compared to last year this metric remains elevated relative to our historical average due to lower revenue resulting from the impact of higher payment rate and lower average receivables we continue to maintain our disciplined focus on cost containment while we make strategic investments in our business to deepen our competitive advantage and drive longterm value for shareholders moving to slide given the reduction in loan receivables in and early coupled with the strength of our deposit platform we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity while we believe its prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile as a result of this strategy there was a shift in our funding mix during the third quarter our deposits declined by billion from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by billion this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year with securitized and unsecured funding each comprising of our funding sources at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets down from last year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 before i provide detail on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which has two primary benefits first it delays the effect of the cecl transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment with this framework we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points above last years level of the tier capital ratio was in the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio increased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year during the quarter we returned billion to shareholders which included billion in share repurchases and million in common stock dividends our business generates strong returns and considerable capital resulting from our commitment to drive growth at appropriate riskadjusted returns scalability of our technology platform and our ongoing cost discipline we will continue to take the opportunistic approach to returning our excess capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions finally let me focus on our outlook for the fourth quarter which is summarized on slide of our presentation while there are a number of external variables that are difficult to predict with precision we generally expect the third quarters key operating trends to be stable in the fourth quarter underpinning our forecast is a stable and improving macroeconomic environment and the pandemic continuing to be largely in control we expect strong consumer demand through the holiday season to support continued strength in purchase volume this trend partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates should lead to a modest growth in receivables our net interest margin will likely be consistent with our provision for credit losses will continue to reflect the impact of asset growth credit performance and macroeconomic factors as well as continued reserve reductions related to the gap portfolio as credit losses begin to normalize we expect the rsa as a percent of average loan receivables to begin to moderate lastly turning to our operating expense we expect the acceleration in purchase volume to contribute to a slight sequential increase in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter that said we continue to expect the fullyear operating expenses to be down compared to as we close out the year and look forward to the future were excited about the opportunities we see to continue to drive strong financial results and shareholder value we are wellpositioned to execute on the strategy we laid out during our investor day and drive sustainable growth and attractive riskadjusted returns simply by continuing to leverage our inherent core strengths the breadth and depth of our business model the scalability of our innovative digital capabilities and customer lifetime value expansion we drive through our diversified product suite and powerful value propositions ill now turn the call back over to brian for his final thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian im really proud

between our partners and customers synchrony continues to reach engage and serve more customers and drive greater more sustainable outcomes for our stakeholders with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions we have our first question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial morning betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just had a couple of questions wanted to understand what you are thinking about with regard to the purchase volume and the spend volume that youve been generating so far i know its been accelerating it feels like its a little bit light of some of the general purpose card activity that weve seen out there and i would want to get your thoughts on that brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah let me start and then brian can jump in if he has other comments betsy what i would say is in comparison to general purpose cards they had a large depth and larger exposures to some tv and some other purchases that we did not drop as much of them last year so i think when we look at the purchase volume first of all its broadbased across all our platforms we have seen really solid performance the exception being lifestyle which again had a very difficult comp last year with regard to power sports and outdoor power equipment but when we looked at it through the quarter it was actually incredibly consistent from the first week synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 of the quarter and each week as we moved throughout the quarter and thats really extended in here through the first couple of weeks of october so we are very pleased about the activity level on the card its very broad based even the little exposure that we had to with travel and entertainment we saw that pop up with our travel being up on our either cobranded card or the synchrony mastercard restaurants were up so were seeing that growth but our business is very consistent and we think thats really strength as we kind of move through here into the fourth quarter brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i think the only thing i would add betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and if you think about the brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial betsy is were also seeing really good growth on new accounts and so thats really seeding what we think is going to be strong purchase growth as we move into so new accounts were up when you adjust for walmart up so really good growth on new accounts which is really a good indicator i think for quarters to come betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no i got that that was definitely impressive and then when im thinking about the outlook here i know theres a lot of verbiage around moderately up and down things like that i just wanted to hone in on the rsa and understand how we should be thinking about that realize that the profitability of the programs is up this quarter given the strength in nim and given the strength in credit i guess im wondering as i think forward how to think about that rsa trajectory because the rate of change in those two categories obviously it starts to come down and credit starts to build but then at the same time theres marketing and other types of expenses that come into that rsa and im wondering how i should think through the degree to which audio gap we should be angling to brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so betsy and i just want to go back and continue to ground home the fact that the rsas are working as theyre designed right where the profitability of the company as it expands were going to share more on the rsa so that is by design its the buffer we all want when in the downside is but we prefer the upside betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 so right now were just going to were going to pay more so i think as you think about the trajectory as we move forward right its going to move more in line with the nim of the business and the net chargeoffs right so we would expect chargeoffs here probably at a trough and would begin to go up so as the chargeoffs begin to increase thats going to go directly through and theres not really a lag effect when it comes to charge offs through the rsa and i think as you think about the margin of the business and the revenue side of the business as delinquencies begin to rise your revenue goes up so that will flow through and then once you start to get the writeoffs come through the nim will come down a little bit so i think its going to move hopefully in parallel the only lag effect is on the change in reserves but it should move with the business and again we think were probably at the trough on delinquencies now but well see how it develops but were pleased with the performance were pleased with how the rsa actually moved because it moved in line with the business results betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you betsy operator and thank you we have our next question from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning thanks for taking my question brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc new accounts up im wondering can you give us an idea of how many thats coming from the new channels like verizon and venmo versus just deeper penetration of some of the more seasoned partnerships brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah john the way i would frame it is is the new programs why they are performing with our expectation with regard to account performance thats not really going to be a large enough to be a driver in our business given the scale so we really see it in some of the traditional retailers that have opened up and returned to that instore retail experience as well as the continued expansion inside the digital programs and platforms that we have so synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 its really fairly broad based we have not seen any areas where it lagged behind i think as people have have really started to engage kind of post pandemic if i call it that in shopping experiences and i think it goes back to the multiproducts that we have it goes back to the compelling value propositions we have and its broad based so we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and into the holiday season brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john i would say its obviously a combination of you got venmo you got verizon you got walgreens very attractive new value prop at sams club but i also attribute a large portion to the digital investments that weve been making so we have made it so much easier to apply whether youre instore on your phone online you can really do it in a matter of seconds now you just put in a couple of fields you do it right on your phone even if youre instore by scanning a qr code so just making it easier to apply i think all of the macro tailwinds are certainly there in terms of what were experiencing in the business but this is where the digital investments that weve been making over the past five years are really starting to pay off john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats helpful thanks and then second question is can you just give us what the remaining reserve release for the gap brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so john i would say the overall provision was around million so you got about million more over the next couple of quarters to come through the exact timing of that and the cadence will really depend upon the performance of the portfolio as we move through but obviously the first piece is always the biggest in the heldforsale accounting john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay great thanks guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john operator our next question is from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody and good morning synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc id like to talk a little bit about the online sales metric that you posted which is and im curious where you think that is versus the peer average on general purpose and how it compares to your general purpose because as we think about the resumption of spend as the economy reopens im wondering if theres leverage there because you do more inperson than some of your peers brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look i think thats a metric that obviously we believe we overindex in terms of online and mobile sales i think the just look at our partners with amazon and paypal and verizon and others i think that theres certainly leverage there if you look at the portfolio mix and we broke this out a little bit at investor day in terms of where we see a lot of the growth coming longer term inside the company its clearly going to be overindexed in terms of online sales thats speaking kind of particularly to our digital partners as they become a larger share of the overall business but i will say that for some of the more traditional partners that we have we have been i believe instrumental in helping them transform their footprints to be more digital so that has been a big part of what weve tried to do particularly over the last couple of years in response to the pandemic many of our partners had closed stores they moved a lot of their sales online and were a big part of how they were able to meet that need and transform their businesses brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial so certainly leverage going forward rick for sure richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thanks brian great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah operator and thank you our next question is from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi brian just wondering if you could talk a little bit i mean it seems like 30day plus day delinquencies have sort of troughed here and as you look forward were going to normalize when do you think theyll start turning synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 positive yearoveryear is that like a mid next year type event or as you can you talk about that normalization process brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john good morning so i think if i were to lay out for you two cases on delinquency the first being a little bit more conservative which says you have a more sharper rise in delinquency that would begin starting here in the fourth quarter would peak third quarter next year and results in net chargeoff peak in the first quarter of so thats a more conservative case and the basis for that case becomes one where as you have individuals coming off of consumers coming off of forbearance government assistance rental forbearance that that they have not been able to sustain enough savings in order to avoid that so thats a sharper case and more conservative case a more optimistic case would say you would see a slower rise in delinquencies as you move through into and then really your loss rate comes back in line end of into and i say in line being back to the mean call it so its a much more gradual rise and that premises on the fact that the consumers were able to build up enough savings so that when the financial obligations come back online for them theyre able to continue to pay their bills immediately so those are the kind of the bookins that i would think about donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thats actually really helpful thank you brian anything on the acquisition side whether its bolton fintechs or portfolios anything that youre looking at that could be good candidates here brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john i would say look we have a very active ma pipeline the teams out there screening for opportunities every day i will tell you that the one thing we are hoping to see in the pandemic was valuations coming back down to earth a bit in fact we saw the opposite so things are still really expensive out there both in terms of capabilities as well as businesses so were certainly looking at a number of things id say existing businesses where we can leverage our scale to grow those businesses i think allegro credit is a great example of that thats the great example of that where were able to leverage our scale in care credit in health and wellness and buy those businesses and really grow them well which we shared a little bit at investor day around how we did that but were going to be disciplined were looking for acquisitions that are not only strategic but accretive and so we stay pretty disciplined on that but the team is very active on that front donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you okay brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah operator and thank you our next question is from sanjay sakhrani with kbw synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i just had one question for brian wenzel and one for brian doubles brian wenzel on the guidance if we look at the net interest margin expectation i guess you guys are assuming there is going to be an acceleration in loan growth and we should have higher delinquencies shouldnt that help the nim so shouldnt the nim actually be better as we move into next quarter or are there other factors that are weighing against it brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial first of all good morning sanjay a couple of factors you are going to see the loan growth which obviously goes into the denominator and actually pushes the nim down and then when you think about it you are getting you will get a little bit of offset as you see some of the chargeoffs and delinquency rise you will see a little bit of the writeoff reversal that goes back through so its not necessarily out of line with i think past years if you look back a couple of years ago so it should be aligned with that but again were very pleased with the nim being up in the 15plus percent range that i know a lot of people focused on when we were basis points lower than where we are today so were obviously pleased with its performance sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc absolutely no it was a good sequential move clearly and then brian doubles obviously you guys have done a number of or made a number of moves just in this last quarter the pay in product announcement this embedded finance relationship with paypal and the clover partnership and you talked in the press release about positioning for a diverse universe of partners i was just curious sort of how we should think about are there like the product pipeline going forward are there other deals like that where youre going to be an embedded partner from a financial standpoint for other technology players and then just how does it play into the business model like the revenues and expenses on a goforward basis does the complexion of those revenues change or how should we think about it thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i would sanjay id take a step back and think about our strategy really in two big pieces one is very focused on products and we spent a lot of time on this at investor day we believe we have the most comprehensive product suite out there whether its private label dual cobrand cards buy now pay later short and longterm installment and so we feel like that is obviously really important given the diversity of our partner set and what they want from us the other really important part of the strategy is really around distribution of those financial products so this is think about integration into the merchants and providers making it easier to apply for those products and really getting that scale so its one thing to have the products but you got to have the distribution channels as well and so if you to go back over time we do a lot in terms of direct partner integration so thats leveraging our apis synchrony plugin et cetera but in some cases we are looking to expand distribution through practice management systems like epic any time we can build a solution once and reach thousands of merchants we absolutely want to do that and thats really what clover does for us with the development of a single app we can reach thousands of merchants we can tap into their roughly billion of gpv so we think this is a big opportunity it allows us to do something once and get immediate scale and so if theyre were actively looking at other opportunities to do synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 that for our products but this is really think about it as really a twopronged approach you got to have the product set but then you got to have a distribution channel or a set of distribution channels that allow you to scale quickly and get those products made available to our merchants and their customers sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay operator we have our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i wanted to ask a followup on credit as we look ahead to nco rates normalizing higher off these low levels there has been some concern that this could lead to reserve building headwinds but since your reserve rate is still well above your day level of just under is it reasonable to expect that that reserve rate is going to continue to drift lower from here even as nco rates normalize higher such that that credit normalization process does not necessarily lead to reserve building headwinds just some highlevel commentary around those dynamics would be super helpful brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks and good morning bill the way i think about chargeoffs and the reserve build our reserve build will still really be driven by asset builds and the macroeconomic assumptions you are correct were operating now at just under our cecl day was and we expect that migration to happen over time now again cecl day was we never actually had a normal quarter under cecl but if you use that as a guidepost thats where we would expect to move back towards so youre right there will some rate but again asset builds will dominate so the reserve provisioning there may be reserve builds that come that are partially offset by more normal rate reductions as you move closer depending upon how again how credit performs and how the macroeconomic looks but it wont avoid reserve builds if youre in an asset increasing environment bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats really helpful if i could squeeze in one last one on buy now pay later have your pay in and other longterm installment product options been rolled out across your entire merchant base and i know its still early but are you seeing any evidence of cannibalization from existing synchrony customers with the traditional synchrony revolving credit product that have signed up for pay in that pay in option or is the customer just signing up for pay in typically somebody who might not even have qualified for credit and theyre just using pay in to turn their debit card into a credit card i would appreciate your thoughts there brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 yeah so why dont we just take a step back though i think and ill break buy now pay later into a couple categories because i think right now everything is getting lumped into buy now pay later and as weve indicated in the past we do about billion of installment both short and long term we offer those products in about locations today and i really think about it in two buckets first youve got what we call closedend installment or buy now pay later thats growing really well for us so that is just a closedend loan very simple a number of different durations and if you look over the past three years from to the purchase volume on those closedend products has grown at about a year so were definitely seeing really good traction there we have buy now pay later in market today with partners like tulo american signature electronics express thats branded as setpay and then we talked at investor day that starting in october we will have our pay in product available for partners so were in discussions with them right now and talking about integration plans and getting that in market i will tell you to your point theyre focused on exactly what you said which is how does this product compete with the products that they currently offer and at investor day we talked a lot about the economic equation for our partners and i can tell you that is something that i think six to nine months ago they werent all that focused on but right now theyre very focused on it so theyre looking at the tradeoffs between like traditional product where they might earn an rsa and how does that compare to a short or a longterm installment product or pay in where theyre paying a merchant discount and so i think the way this is going to play out is there is going to be a lot of kind of testing and learning and seeing how these products kind of work together what the customer uptake is and then at the end of the day what the economic equation is back to the partner so thats one big bucket of what we call installment closedend buy now pay later the other thing that we talked about is the buy now pay later option or installment option that we offer on our cards so on a revolving account and this is where we continue to see a lot of really strong interest from our partners and part of what they like about that is you can actually do multiple installment loans or buy now pay later loans without an additional credit check or application process it also gives the customer the ability to when they want to just make a regular purchase not on a installment basis and take advantage of the value prop so save for instance at amazon and what weve seen is customers really like to have that optionality so for some purchases they want to put it on a six month or a month equal pay buy now pay later product in some cases they want to take advantage of the value prop and whats nice about that product is it allows you to do both and really gives the customer that choice at the end of the day the partners on their side they really like that because it allows them to do more lifecycle marketing right so they can push out offers and promotions around holiday and things like that so they like that lifecycle relationship that theyre able to maintain with the customer so look at the end of the day i think everyone of our partners is looking at this a little bit differently theyre looking at the interplay between these products or looking at the economic equation i think the good news is if you take a step back and you see how we are positioned we have a very comprehensive suite of products we can sit down with a partner and they can basically choose from a menu in terms of what they want to offer and we can lay out for them the economic equation what we think its going to do to their sales et cetera so i feel like were very well positioned weve got the product suite weve got the ability to integrate quickly with our partners and we think over time the multiproduct strategy is the winning one synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful thank you for taking my questions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks bill brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks bill operator our next question is from john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on your payment rate expectations i know you expect payment rate to gradually normalize if you could maybe help size that up is it similar to the third quarter decline and also are you seeing any incremental evidence of accounts that typically revolve starting to carry balances again if maybe if you can give us a little bit of granularity there thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure thanks and good morning john so obviously in the deck we showed you the elevated level that we saw in the third quarter and as we move into the fourth quarter again that rate its going to continue to be elevated id point to a couple of things as we think about payment rate and the trends we have done a lot of analysis to try to make sure that we as we look at it that we believe its going to revert back to the mean and everything we have seen still leaves us to that conclusion that there is a reversion back to the mean there are a couple of ill call underlying data points that i would try to point you to number one as we look at the savings rates for the consumers they are drifting down to more normalized level and prepandemic and we look at that both as the big money center banks as well as the digitallyoriented banks and then what we see with regard to movement in our savings savings account so one savings is coming down savings rate is coming down which again part of thats going to be the high purchase volume the second we start to look at cohorts inside of our portfolio we do see very slight movements down so for instance if you looked at a product level our dual card product sequentially second quarter to third quarter had a slight decline in the payment rate on a product level thats a higher fico customer that is beginning to migrate back down when you look at it with regard to accounts that either pay full pay between full pay or statement balance and min pay and then statement balance or less than statement balances across all those categories weve seen slight reduction in that payment rate so if you think about the people who paid statement balances that is slightly lower third quarter versus second the people are paying between statement balance and min balance that is lower in the third quarter than the second quarter and then the min pay is up slightly third quarter versus second and then the people paying less than the min pay is up slightly so i think as we start seeing a very slight synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 movement those are movements that that would tell us that the payment rate is going to move back towards the mean that we experienced prepandemic or were starting to see a little bit of signs there john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it no thank you brian thats helpful and then secondly on the nim i appreciate the color you gave earlier in terms of some of the moving parts for the linked quarter expectation is there incremental opportunity around funding that you can continue to optimize the funding stack here to support the nim further out that we can possibly dial in thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah in our funding stack today we have that is funded with retail deposit we have not been an active issuer in the market either in im sorry in or i would expect us to access the market first i think its good for the liquidity of the company so we would expect to see a little bit of activity because we have not replaced some of that expiring debt but i would imagine that our deposit funding rate will remain elevated versus the to that we historically have guided to i think also there is an opportunity with our paypal savings product to continue to broaden the reach to customers in retail so were excited about that when it comes out in the coming months so were going to continue to focus on on trying to optimize the cost but we also want to maintain access to the deep market whether thats secured unsecured as we begin to get the capitals back in order we would probably access additional preferreds to build out the capital stack of the company and get down to our target level so we intend to be an active issuer over time and do it in a way that optimizes the cost john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thanks brian i appreciate you taking my questions brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you kathryn harmon miller a senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial thank you operator i think we have time for one more question operator thank you our question comes from mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks you made a lot of progress in the quarter against your repurchase authorization could you just discuss kind of the cadence of buybacks going forward and whether we should expect anything incremental as you sell the gap portfolio synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so thanks mark so the gap the way the gap capital releases obviously weve had a portion of the reserve release thats a smaller portion that flowed back through capital this quarter the bulk of the reserve release will happen in the second quarter next year when we tend to convey that portfolio so that will probably be included in our next capital plan we have billion remaining under the existing authorization that we have as we enter the quarter so were pleased with how we repurchased shares during the third quarter as we said before well be aggressive but prudent as we move forward here and as always well continue to run our internal stress test model evaluate the performance of the business and the income profile and to the extent that we believe its prudent well engage in discussions with our board about potentially increasing the authorization but right now we have billion ahead of us and again we want to be aggressive but prudent as we continue to reduce the capital level of the company towards closer to our longterm target mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc got it thats helpful and a separate question could you just discuss expectations for goforward opex as you weigh the different crosscurrents of your your kind of ongoing cost containment initiatives and the runoff of the gap partnership against the need to continue to invest in the platform brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah our first priority from brian and margaret and the board is to continue to maintain the longterm investments that we have in the business and the strategic initiatives so we do almost everything to protect that because thats in the best interest of our shareholders that longterm value around that weve maintained a cost discipline weve reduced a lot of costs were on target for our million this year but weve made some moves to invest back in certain aspects of our business that includes going to an hour for our nonexempt workforce and investing back into the business i think as you look at the fourth quarter theres going to be a slight increase as you think about some marketing and some things that are going to happen in the quarter but again we would expect as you move forward that as revenue comes back in line our progression back towards an efficiency level back in the low and discipline on if you think about it on a dollar basis as we sequentially move through mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc
