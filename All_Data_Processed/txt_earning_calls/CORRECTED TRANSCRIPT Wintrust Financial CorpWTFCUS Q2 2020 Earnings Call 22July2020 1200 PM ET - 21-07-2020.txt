to mr edward wehmer edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you very much and welcome to our second quarter earnings call with me as always are dave dykstra our vice chairman and chief operating officer dave stoehr our cfo kate boege our general counsel tim crane president of wintrust and rich murphy vice chairman and chief lending officer wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 by the same format as usual im going to im talking funny because i had a tooth removed its not because i have a mask on or anything but im going to give some general comments regarding our results turn over to dave dykstra for a detailed analysis of other income other expense and taxes back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future and then ill leave it to questions in my years of being an associate of the bank industry i thought id seen it all how stupid of me to be arrogant enough to think that the covid pandemic the resulting unprecedented government economic intervention interest rates falling to basically nothing remote work environment for pretty much the entire staff the implementation indiscernible loan loss provisioning surely made life interesting add those of social unrest and the presidential election weve got a very very spicy indiscernible all we need are locusts and earthquakes or floods to make this somewhat biblical its times when our high tech high touch relationshipbased distribution model our consistent and conservative approach to credit and liquidity diversified asset base actually shine add to this our strategic agility borne out of our structure and culture and we look forward to whatever the current environment throws at us sticking into basics now have never been more important on our results for the quarter our quarter could be summarized in a couple of bullet points great asset and deposit growth spearheaded by over ppp loans totaling billion and resulting halo effect ph even better mortgage results despite approximately million of onetime expenses first would be the million msr valuation adjustment and if you wonder how low they can go now i mean weve really written them down to basically nothing so if rates move up we have a beach ball underwater there and million in conditional contingent consideration the contingent consideration is a result of us buying a mortgage company a number of years ago and setting up a liability for the contingent consideration with the strong mortgage market theyre outperforming indiscernible more money that number is a onetime because we basically have projected out where we think theyre going to be for the duration of the contingent period so thats close to million of onetimers associated with mortgage outsized provision expense of million despite traditional consistent traditional credit metrics the loan modification curve has peaked and appears to be decreasing ph increasing net interest margins in a low rate environment not just liquidity increased nii due to overall asset growth and net overhead ratio of ph positive ins and outs here but million of onetime conversion expense related to or the acquisition expense related to our ph dp conversion dave dykstra will take you through this in detail momentarily pretax preprovision premsr earnings was million up approximately million not including the one time of expenses previously ph for that and including that im sorry including onetime expenses previously referenced we completed a preferred stock offering which generated million new capital to support growth taking advantage of dislocations that may occur in the market and anything else that may come along earnings front we had million of earnings down diluted earnings per share of down we talked about the pretax preprovision premsr numbers and net interest margin dropped basis points due to the low interest rate environment and excess liquidity and the other numbers come out accordingly margin really got clabbered down basis points this quarter due to the rate environment going to basically zero and excess overnight liquidity held on our balance sheet overnight liquidity totaled billion up billion from q1 this resulted in overall liquidity in an overall portfolio duration years compared to years at wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 we did bulk up on liquidity being in a crisis i believe its the prudent thing to do as we did not know if and when thered be any available funding for the ppp loans now things have settled down a bit well be returning some of the excess liquidity in q3 knowing that there are alternatives for ppp funding which we have not taken advantage of todate indiscernible delever our balance sheet a bit for the time being todate in the third quarter indiscernible this margin is basically held at a zero spread should help the margin going forward also there is some room on the deposits side through these rates approximately billion of cd deposits indiscernible average rate about is scheduled to mature and be repriced in the next six months also in july and august ph an additional billion indiscernible we expect the majority of ppp loans to be forgiven in the third and fourth quarters of this year based on surveys we did with our ppp borrowers the congress approves automatic forgiveness on the loans under and should expedite the process as twothirds of our outstanding loans would be covered by this mandate this will help the margin and net interest income indiscernible as will be discussed momentarily our commercial and cre pipelines remain strong ph gives us a momentum in the niche businesses specifically for premium finance and leasing we still expect the margin notwithstanding the effect of ppp loans to settle in the to range when the dust clears assuming no round two of ppp stimulus net interest income should also increase other income or other expense dave will cover in detail but needless to say our mortgage company hit the cover off the ball billion of production over million in gross income almost double the previous quarter margins were stronger in this business only negatives were the million msr valuation downward msr valuation adjustment and million contingent consideration expense as i said earlier the latter is ironically a good thing because we expect above normal credit mortgage volumes for the foreseeable future wealth management fees were down over million due to market fluctuations as most fees are based on the ph prior quarter end low asset levels assets under administration at actually grew ph billion quarter versus quarter and we expect a rebound in fee income at quarter three barring any other wild gyrations or other things we dont anticipate in the market on the provision provision for credit provision for the quarter totaled million versus million in q1 and million in q2 indiscernible actually of that provision can be attributed to portfolio changes the majority of which are the result of loan modifications ph the remainder of the provision relates to economic factors used on our models all traditional credit metrics stayed relatively constant net chargeoffs totaled million or basis points million sic million of those chargeoffs related to credits that have specific reserves assigned in previous quarters npas totaled million or sic of total assets compared to million or at march the majority of increase related to premium finance commercial premium finance loans well discuss later the ticket size of our premium finance loans was up a lot and accordingly the amount of nonperforming commercial premium finance loans ph made mostly have increased you should know however that every one of those or of those the losses are taken earlier and those are confirmed we have confirmed the term premiums covered the outstanding so it really kind of inflates our number but ph gaap is gaap loan modifications in the quarter totaled billion a related loan totals the growthcurverelated loan indiscernible so far in q3 we included a lot of information indiscernible industries and wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 loan modifications in the earnings release rather than regurgitate all that information to you now we that is rich murphy our chief lending officer can handle inquiries in the qa total credit reserves on the core loan portfolio stood at related to balances premium finance loans carry a 14basispoint reserve which is appropriate given billion in life portfolio has never had knock on wood has never had a loss and purchased loans carry a 230basispoint reserve ph we used to say in the old way of calculating reserves and provisions the numbers will be nowhere indiscernible not that we are na√Øve enough to think that these are extraordinary times indiscernible credit losses but i guess time will tell when the cecl is accurate or whether the industry will be subject to the whims and the quants and model makers if one loses a girlfriend or has a hangover you never know what they can do to the industry now based on these new models indiscernible see what the future brings the balance sheet side which has a great growth of billion loans grew billion ill talk about that in a second average loans obviously were up higher than period end loans so we should period end loans im sorry are higher than average loans so we should be able to achieve the benefit of that going forward our loan to deposit ratio of was in the high ph when we did that ppp loans so we have room for plenty of liquidity and have room to invest that in our loans we discussed our excess liquidity and the overall effect on liquidity management ph and margin earlier loan growth not including the billion of ppp loans is driven by premium finance portfolio commercial premium finance loans grew million and was driven by higher average ticket sizes was the average ticket size in this quarter versus in q1 and ph from a year ago this bodes well for future quarters the life insurance portfolio also grew at almost million commercial real estate loans were basically flat for the quarter and our core commercial loans were down million approximately million indiscernible related to line usage return to normal levels at the end of the quarter at the end the first quarter we had line usage we were down to in the second quarter as many clients drew their lines in the first quarter hence their liquidity present uncertain future we estimate another million plusminus of ppp proceeds we used to pay down other debt i know thats a lot of stack but actually show growth for the quarter speaking of ppp loans todate we have loans or billion i cannot be prouder of our team for satisfying all these clients and our clients through their great service we are currently working on landing ph employee relationships for over new prospects who could not be served by ph larger competitors this is over this is approximately this represents years of new business resulting from the halo effect of our peoples good work as a result 90day pipelines are very very full deposits grew nicely in the quarter as we mentioned weve completed our preferred offering in a million million tier capital the capital will support our growth but also take advantage of any asset dislocations that may result from these uncertain times and provide a cushion for any unexpected contingencies that may arise estimated tier and tier capital ratios were and respectively ill turn the call over to dave to provide some additional detail other income and other expense david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp all right ed thank you very much ed touched a little bit on some of the noninterest income and expense section ill just give a little bit more detail in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenues wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 decreased million to million in the second quarter compared to million in the first quarter of the year and down from the million recorded in the yearago quarter the decline was impacted by the volatile equity valuations during the first half of the year which impacts the pricing on a portion of our managed asset accounts and also due to some lower trading in the brokerage accounts given current market conditions as ed indicated we would expect those revenues to rebound in the third quarter mortgage banking revenue increased by a whopping or million to million in the second quarter from the million recorded in the prior quarter and was also up strong from the million recorded in the second quarter of last year the company originated billion of mortgage loans for sale in the second quarter this compares to million of originations in the first quarter of the year and also the second quarter of last year so up billion from last quarter and the year ago quarter in production the increase in the categories revenue from the prior quarter resulted primarily from that increased volume as well as expanding production margins which led to an increase in production revenue of million capitalized mortgage servicing revenue also positively impacted the mortgage revenue as capitalized msrs net of payoffs and paydown activity was approximately million higher than the prior quarter these positive revenue measures were offset by a negative msr adjustment net of the hedging ph plan tracks during the second quarter of approximately million compared to a negative msr adjustment of million in the prior quarter the mix of loan volume originated for sale that was related to the refinance activity was approximately compared to in the prior quarter so the refinance volume increased slightly during the quarter and the pipeline is predominantly filled with refinance applications as of now so we expect to have another strong third quarter as ed indicated as the continuation of that refinance activity is represented in a strong committed pipeline as of this time however production margins may compress a little bit from the recent lofty levels they top out over we expect them probably a drop back down into the level but well see what happens for the remainder of the quarter table of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation of the components of the mortgage servicing revenue and msr activity and levels other noninterest income totaled million in the second quarter down approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter the lower revenue in this category was due to lower capital market activity from loan sales and syndications a lower amount of card and merchant based services due to a lower activity card activity and losses on investment partnerships these decreases were partially offset by million of higher boli income as boli investments supporting deferred compensation plans were positively impacted by equity market returns during the quarter i should note though that the boli income in the second quarter resulted in a similar increase in compensation expense as the deferred compensation and boli investments move in tandem together turning to noninterest expense categories noninterest expenses totaled million in the second quarter up approximately million or from the million recorded in the prior quarter relative to the prior quarter there were three main factors that contributed to the increase first the company recorded approximately million of additional contingent purchase price consideration related to the acquired mortgage banking operations so the difference between the contingent consideration expense in the first quarter and the second quarter is million second we incurred approximately million of additional commissions and incentive compensations during this quarter relative to last quarter primarily due to the mortgage business and third approximately million of additional wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 fdic insurance assessments was recorded due to the growth in the balance sheet and the impact of the ppp loans on our leverage ratio so if you add up those three items they combined to million of the million increase so essentially all of the increase was related to those three items with that being said ill talk about these and a few more items in a bit more detail now the salaries and employee benefit category increased by million in the second quarter from the prior quarter this year the majority of the increase as i mentioned related to incentive compensation accruals which were approximately million higher than the prior quarter with that change being largely driven by additional commissions on significantly higher mortgage loan production closed during the quarter additionally salaries expense up million from the first quarter the primary causes of that was related to the million of deferred compensation costs tied to the boli investment gain that ive mentioned earlier and additionally the company incurred approximately million of overtime and temporary health expense in the current quarter to support the significant mortgage volume being processed through the system and incurred approximately million of elevated pay for covidrelated compensation matters offsetting these increases was a higher level of deferred salary cost recorded as significant loan volume during the quarter occurred primarily related to the ppp loan category further offsetting the aforementioned increases in salary and incentive compensation expenses the employee benefit expense was approximately million lower in the current quarter than the prior quarter primarily due to reduction in employee insurance claims as were seeing that our employees are doing less discretionary doctor visits during the pandemic workfromhome time periods and social distancing time periods data processing expense increased approximately million from the second quarter compared to the prior quarter due primarily to a million conversion charge related to the countryside bank acquisition versus million of ph deconversion charges incurred in the prior quarter so a delta there of million i should note that all acquisitionrelated conversion and ph deconversion costs are behind us for all the completed acquisitions and accordingly the third quarter should be void of any such charges as i mentioned fdic insurance expense was up million in the first quarter compared to the prior quarter the increase was primarily due to increased assessment rates at our subsidiary banks as a result of balance sheet growth and lower leverage ratios although relief was provided for fdic insurance premiums related to increases in assets from ppp loans for the asset size component of the assessment relief was not provided for the leverage ratio unless a bank utilized the feds pppl funding program because we did not need the pppl funding program to fund our ppp loans we did not receive the fdic insurance release on the leverage ratio component of the rate determination so as unfair as that may seem relative to a bank that funded using the feds program it is what it is and our assessment rates were higher for that reason and also due to other growth in the balance sheet now professional fees increased to million in the second quarter compared to million in the prior quarter now the professional fee categories averaged approximately million over the last five quarters so its in line with our average and its a variety of relates to a variety of matters such as legal services related to litigation problem loan workout consulting services and legal services related to acquisitions advertising and marketing expense in the second quarter decreased by million when compared to the first quarter of the year the decline was primarily related to a decline in sponsorship spendings including our sponsorships of various major and minor league baseball teams which have not been active as well as other wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 summer eventrelated sponsorships which have been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic this expense category also had a lower level of mass media advertising cost as a result of reduced mass media spending which was not incurred due to the cancellation of the major league baseball events and our related media surrounding those events oreo expenses increased by approximately million in the second quarter as the company recorded a gain of approximately million on a sale of an oreo property during the prior quarter and only a small oreo loss was recorded in the current quarter so although this expense category increased the total expense for the quarter was only approximately the miscellaneous expense category totaled million in the second quarter compared to million in the first quarter an increase of million this increase was caused by the aforementioned million of additional contingent consideration related to the previously acquired mortgage banking operations the increase is a result of higher anticipated contingent purchase price payments resulting from both current volume closed so far in as well as forecasted revenues out through the end of the respective earnout periods for our previous mortgage banking acquisitions offsetting that charge was the lower level of travel and entertainment expense and a variety of other smaller fluctuations so without the contingent consideration accrual the miscellaneous expense category would have actually declined during the quarter and as ed mentioned we think we have taken care of the contingent consideration based upon current mortgage volume projections so other than the expense categories i just discussed all of the expense categories were down on an aggregate basis by approximately from the first quarter as ed mentioned the net overhead ratio stood at which is down basis points from the recorded in the first quarter aided by the growth on the balance sheet on a strong mortgage quarter on a yeartodate basis the overhead ratio was and again aided by the balance sheet growth in the mortgage results so with that ill talk about the tax rate just briefly as im sure somebody will have a question on that we generally think of the tax rate of being in to range this quarter it was at and really the result of the increased fdic insurance expense which is not fully taxdeductible so that caused an increase in the rate because of the increased expense and because of the lower pretax earnings number due to provision adjustment so that the denominator was smaller and the numerator was a little bit bigger because of the ph disallowed fdic insurance expense so with that ill wrap up my remarks and turn it back over to ed edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you dave interesting times as they say but were wellprepared for whatever comes our way our capital levers levels are robust forgiveness of ppp loans should accelerate recognition of fees and were prepared for round two if and when the government ever approves the halo effect from that effort should provide additional core loan and deposit growth our loan pipelines as mentioned remain very strong commercial premium finance should continue to still benefit from that hard market were now in tailwinds in the mortgage business should allow for ph call to normal business for the rest of the year credit metrics remain strong reserves are at their highest level in customer in company history and as i said earlier im not na√Øve enough to believe the current situation will leave credit unscathed but as of now we dont see it were prepared if it turns wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 first loss is your best loss we will continue to our practice of culling our loan portfolio to early identify cracks and deal with issues historically weve operated the credit metrics that have been a fraction of peer group due to our conservative lending practices product mix and our diversified portfolio we expect that to continue loan deferrals which were below peer metrics to begin with are declining managing liquidity to optimize earnings both now and in the future while retaining the asset levels to accommodate an uncertain future we believe that there will be dislocations that will result from the current state of the world ph so hopefully the acquisition market ph will open up until some of the uncertainty goes away we always say that we take what the market gives us right now its giving us organic growth opportunities our goal is to prudently grow through this period in time as the zero interest rate environment will not provide much opportunity to grow the margin ph what we need to do prepare our balance sheet for higher rates i dont know about you but to me it feels like the all over again not that i would be breaking out in my bell bottoms or disco records any time soon but it appears that higher interest rates are in our future based on the level of the activity of the government printing presses so were preparing for that were trying to optimize earnings and well keep the balance sheet ready for higher rates the probability ph of those of them going lower is certainly offset is diminished by the zero rate environment and the opportunity indiscernible we should be there so with that im going to turn over to ask any ph youll always be considered our best efforts and we appreciate your support now its time for questions question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your question please christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey ed ed or dave the outlook for net interest income im interested at and totally appreciate theres been a lot of moving parts with the ppp i guess the first question is was there any of the million fees that you booked in q2 and how should we think about the cadence of that million david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 yeah so the approach we took on this which we think is the right way to do it under gaap is were doing a level yield method on the ppp loan fees and we did a survey of all of our customers and got input from them as to when they thought they would submit their application and what sort of forgiveness level they thought they would have and based upon those responses and based upon communications with our customers we think that most of probably at least of the loans would be forgiven and we would get our funds from the sba by the end of the year and so weve and then the rest we would assume we would go out over the remainder of the contractual terms of the loans at so we put that schedule together and we created a level yield chart which we can adjust as time goes on here as we know the sba could change the rules they could go to this onepage form and have the some of the smaller loans repay much quicker and they could potentially process them much quicker but weve gone on the assumption that will be paid off by the end of the fourth quarter through the forgiveness process and the rest would be projected forward and so we have taken the fees and based upon that schedule so in the second quarter we recognized approximately million of the million edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp this represents two and a half months not a full three months christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay so million is the remainder is that right edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah indiscernible david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we continue to book loans its were booking probably an average of million a day we are we dont open the portal but we are contacting customers who will then take advantage of it and we continue to book more of these loans as available so a little bit more i cant imagine we will add materially to it but theres supposed to be more coming in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i think ed in your remarks you once we get through the next six months correct me if im wrong i think you said to is kind of a exit margin for the business in this rate environment is that the right way to think about it once you get through it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 yeah i think thats fair depends on where life goes but our loan pipelines are very strong we have a lot of liquidity on the balance sheet right now put to use i mean at an loantodeposit ratio taking the ppp loans out we ph dont see that to grow that side of it we can ph trick it a little bit because we had bulked up on liquidity because back at the remember the end of the first quarter we knew what was going on and we felt it appropriate to have an oversized amount liquidity just in case we didnt know that the government ph was going to allow the ppp loan funding we couldnt the governments not your best counterparty you cant trust them rely on them for anything so we relied on ourselves there so there are a lot of moving parts here but we think that thats about the number were going to come up with christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just maybe a couple of housekeeping the fdic insurance cost dave does that gradually go back to where it was as these loans pay down how does it how does that work david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well as yeah as the loans we get the reason we got dinged was not because of the size of the balance sheet because they did allow you to exclude the ppp loans on the asset component of that calculation but where we got dinged was our leverage ratio so as if the leverage ratio increases then our fdic insurance rate would come down so as we make more money and the leverage ratio goes up hopefully then we could do that or if we downstream some capital into the banks it could potentially reduce it but i would suspect that it would be a similar amount in the third quarter because the leverage ratio isnt going to shoot to the moon even if those ppp loans pay off from a leverage ratio perspective theyll still be in our average assets so itll just switch from a loan to liquidity so christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp right edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp what really happened was i mean ph we had remember back in march nobody knew what was going on and we made the decision to pull some dividends out because we hadnt done our capital offering yet didnt know wed be able to get one ph off cash at the holding company is king there so we did wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 that jeopardized the banks we did pull their capital levels down so as they earn as the ppp loans go up and now that we have lot of cash with the holding company we very well could put some in and bring that level down but thats to be determined but i we thought it was a prudent thing to do to bring cash out to as they have it at the holding company because the cash is king at the holding company if you dont have it it starts the debt spiral and we dont want that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and so thatll stay steady but that million contingent number will come out dave in the next quarter right david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well thats correct unless for some reason the mortgage market went way way higher because were forecasting out over a few year period for these deals so were making our best guess based upon talking to the business people but its i would think that that would not go higher it could get tweaked a little up or down as volumes change a little bit but it that should be its sort of like cecl youre making your best guess right now based upon forecasts and it is what it is but i cant imagine that we can actually handle much more volume than what were doing right now so i think that should be a good number and not recur christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your question please jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc many thanks good morning guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey i wanted to ask about the reserve build that especially that million in economic factors curious if you guys were surprised by that amount particularly relative to last quarter and when you look think about your qualitative overlay what would need to change for you guys to have another build in that economic factor david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i guess im a little surprised by the magnitude of it but the models spit it out but if you look at it the moodys models really that they have the economic factors that we use generally is the commercial real estate price index which is the thing that drove most of that and those projections were down quite a bit at the end of the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 second quarter versus the first quarter the baa credit spreads impact us too and those were a little bit wider and gdp impacts some of the factors as well as the dow jones so the big impact there was the commercial real estate price index impacting the macroeconomic factors so if you saw the commercial real estate price index deteriorate further could be that we might have some additional expense but it is a line sort of a line in the sand at june thats our portfolio and thats the provision and so assuming conditions stay relatively stable going forward you shouldnt have much more provision unless you grow your balance sheet so the reserves are out there and we think weve got them marked pretty good that if for some reason the commercial real estate price index improves a little bit the forecast for that improves a little bit you could actually see some relief on that number if that number gets substantially worse then there might be a little bit more pain but we as ive said if you look at the our chargeoffs you look at our past dues you look at our npas you look at the curve flattening and new deferral requests coming down and actually the overall deferral requests declining you dont get the feel right now that youre going to need to add to that reserve anymore that the economy is getting worse so a little bit surprising to us but of that increase from the allowance was really related to gdp being worse in the second quarter and more importantly in the commercial real estate price index edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp those are the two big factors so those are the ones we track we do some qualitative overlays to it based on certain portfolio characteristics but thats whats driving the increase and thats what you should sort of follow i think edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah the other is if you think about the other related to ph things having to downgrade in the portfolio also downgrades occurred because of the loan mods so rich you want to talk about where loan mods are because we see them going down and richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah no i think that we as talked about in the last earnings call in the highlyaffected industries we saw ph cmod activity really come pretty aggressively during that those first couple weeks of april particularly in the franchise space and we track that very closely we follow it at the management team by segment and what were seeing now as we get through the first days and now at indiscernible days as those come off were seeing a fairly steep decline in the customers asking for that next round so that coupled with as dave pointed out really new requests for deferrals are very very slow so were starting to see that ph cmod percentage dropping off pretty dramatically so as ed also pointed out those risk ratings that go with those ph cmods audio gap that is a very good sign that those will be upgraded as cash flows improve certainly in the franchise portfolio as we talked about last quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 seeing a material improvement in just overall level of cash flow and that operating performance in that segment so were mildly encouraged right now audio gap jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good that helps it seems like its backs up quite a bit or much better for q3 and then dave you backed us off a little bit on the mortgage banking margin and i understand that but what are you thinking on volumes i mean sometimes it trails off for q3 but it sounds like youve got such a pipeline of refinance that youre not suggesting that david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well we dont necessarily have visibility to the end of the quarter audio gap billion plus or minus i think were we probably will have another billion quarter if applications continue to come in at the level they are right now if you look in our press release we showed we have about a billion of loans that are locked in the pipeline so some of those go beyond days some of them drag out but based upon the pipeline we have there people can walk away if rates went down we could have people walk away but given the pipeline we have and the applications that are coming in and the time its taken to close them now we i think thats billion plus or minus but we didnt see many people walk away from their deals in the second quarter they just didnt want to get back in line so even though rates fell a little bit most people ph filed through and just closed on their mortgage so well have to see if that pullthrough rate continues but if it does i would think that i would think plus or minus billion again edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp applications are not slow too really kind of thinking about july and august as baked already its really september and those applications are still coming in at the same levels so gives you a good feeling jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah ph so i guess thats helpful for q3 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ph hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp jon you want to borrow my bell bottoms or my disco records wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i hey i still have all my teeth wehmer we can indiscernible i still have all my teeth edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp oh boy jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hope youre doing better all right i hope you feel better edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long from raymond james your question please david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks hey everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey david you still have your bell bottoms dont you david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc you know if you keep your clothes long enough youll use them again doesnt matter what ph set they are and the cycles do rotate still i guess im a hoarder but yeah so the i ed just wanted to see if i heard you correctly did you say in quartertodate in the third quarter that deleveraging has already been about billion on the balance sheet edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yes david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 okay okay got it got it and then i didnt see it in the release but were did you guys disclose what the purchase loan marks you guys still have on the books are at this point edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well we have reserve of whatd i say indiscernible so david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i specific reserves we didnt disclose that but its very small david i dont have the number in front of me but its very small david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay okay and then you talked a little bit about the marketing dollars and the sponsorships with major league baseball kicking in here we think in a couple of days ph or start tomorrow maybe with a couple of games what type of increase are we expected to see here from the second quarter to third quarter from those sponsorships that actually will that you will be taking on edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp my guess is about million to million theres no tickets its just the sponsorship ph side of things so david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc sure edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible in october then you might have another million to million but david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp were counting on sox playing the cubs in the series so it may go up a little on that ph poll yeah we there arent and as ed said there arent tickets so itll probably bump up a little bit in the third quarter but not like it was in prior years because you still dont have all the ticket costs david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay all right thats all i have for now thanks guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks david wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race from piper sandler your question please nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi just a question on the excess liquidity bills in the quarter im curious how much you guys how much of that you guys think is kind of indiscernible i know almost twothirds of that is tied to the ppp and whatnot but any sense just in terms of the other deposit growth that you had in the quarter how much of that may stick around and what are kind of your reinvestment plans with some of that excess liquidity as well going forward edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ill give that to tim crane timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah nate ill take the first part of that for sure net weve seen ins and outs municipal deposits were up quite a bit obviously to your point theres probably billion of ppprelated deposits that remain on the balance sheet i dont know exactly what to expect but i dont think its going to go down a ton weve seen good inflows the press release references maxsafe deposits up about billion in the quarter so i would expect sort of pretty flat pre any ppp movements or even up and then dave with respect to utilizing some of the excess liquidity edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well were im really not excited about locking in these rates on mortgagebacked our loan pipelines are very strong right now and i think wed rely on those premium finances those are ninemonth full payout loans so were churning those every nine months and with increase in the average ticket sizes thats going to take an additional loan picking up additional market share thats going to help the life insurance portfolio is doing very well our overall leasing portfolio which is throughout the balance sheet is over billion now shows no sign of letting up and the commercial side again with billion total of billion or billion gross in the pipelines coming down to about billion in estimated draws on that or estimated success rates and that billion of loans has the halo effect i mean its unbelievable ph what happened and they will bring probably another billion of deposits in so i would probably if i had to guess id say were going to be flat on assets it may be up a little bit in the third quarter loantodeposit ratios ppp loans are forgiven will start working their way up again and we may or may not do some mortgagebacked just to make a little bit more money but im more concerned about maintaining our gaap position and now locking in these low rates i truly believe that maybe that this year maybe the next year but with the amount of money in the economy right now and those printing presses continuing to hum especially as phase two of the relief comes through so you go back in time and those always result in higher wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 rates maybe the rest of the world wont but inflations got to ph kick in even with the rest of the world so well see nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah i would agree appreciate that commentary ed and then just thinking about core loan yields maybe ex the ppp programs i mean any sense in terms of how those came down in the quarter im just again just trying to isolate the impact apart from those lower yielding loans david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp how they came down in the second quarter or youre talking about what were thinking about moving forward nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah no im just trying to understand the magnitude of the decline in core loan yields outside of ppp in the second quarter david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well they probably commercial and commercial real estate were probably down from april through june theyre probably down early in the quarter they were probably to basis points higher than later in the quarter nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful i appreciate all the color thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of david chiaverini from wedbush securities your question please david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks couple followup questions here so you mentioned about the moodys model and the cre price index projection being the main driver for the provision in the quarter i was curious are you able to share what that projection is how much are commercial real estate prices expected to come down based on the moodys model david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 yeah well what we had in there the cre price index would decline through the fourth quarter and recovers into but still it would remain below what it was at the end of the first quarter so it declines down it does go down its probably down i think the commercial real estate price index was near at the end of the first quarter and depending on which moodys model you look at but the ones were looking at is sort of if you look at baseline or even if you looked at the s1 model theyre coming down on the range so could be down 20ish david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful and david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and then recovering into is what they show david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it got it okay thats helpful and then did i hear you right given all the moving parts and the utilization rates coming down in the second quarter but looking out to the third quarter for loan growth did i hear you say think of it as flattish given the paydowns and runoff of the ppp will offset some of the growth and pipeline build youre seeing in the other categories edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well notwithstanding ppp which we expect to come down substantially we believe our core portfolio ph or nonppp portfolio should grow nicely based upon ph so all of our niche business is doing well and our commercial pipeline say commercial real estate pipelines been being very full so yeah we think ppp loans in the third and fourth quarter ph be gone barring round two and i dont know if were going to make up billion at that period of time but well manage our liquidity accordingly we would expect our core portfolio to continue to grow david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp but we also would expect unless they do this sba program quickly here and the sba actually turns the sba has got days to turn around the forgiveness applications once they get them they could turn them around in days or days or quicker i suppose but my guess is theyre not going to work at lightning speed just because theyll have a lot of activity from every bank around the country that did these but most likely youll see most of that payoff occur in the fourth quarter so probably through the third quarter well have the ppp loans generally in place david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for that and then the last one is more of a housekeeping question you mentioned about how the fdic assessment was elevated in the second quarter and you expect that to be kind of stable in the third quarter and you mentioned about the tax rate how its normally to but because of the elevated fdic wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 assessment thats where it was in this range so as we think about the tax rate going forward should we think about to given the elevated fdic assessment or how should we think about that david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i dont think so because the denominator really is your pretax income and our pretax income was so depressed because of the million provision so if we go back to the normalized provision the denominators get much larger and should bring that rate back down so id still sort of say to is probably a decent rate and it really sort of depends on the pretax income number but because it was so depressed because of the elevated provision this quarter that was the other reason for the increase in the rate david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your question please brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great good afternoon guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey given the wash of liquidity im just wondering if you have you feel you have much scope to further reduce the cd component of your funding mix its not large on a percentage basis right now im just kind of curious if you thought you could work it down further edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ph i think naturally that should come down and since we dont want to lock up these rates other people dont either so i think itll move in the money market indiscernible i think people will just wait but yeah i think its natural that cds would come down a bit brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and on the deferrals what do you think the end game is there you can obviously redefer those do you decide at some point to kind of reunderwrite and modify some of those that i believe under the cares act would not be considered a tdr if you did that but just wanted to talk that through wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp so ill turn it over to rich in a second but we on round one weve shared the pain we dont just hand them out like candy we actually reunderwrite and look at them at that point in time and say boy you could do x y and z to save cash why come at us so we ph put the advisors there to share the pain and enhance our position and the second time around theres more pain so murph what do you think richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp no you hit the nail on the head yeah i think theres as we walk through time here the first round i think a lot of our peers were really were pretty much looking at that as just kind of a free pass we looked at it we certainly wanted to be there to help out our customers who were stressed but we also did as ed said we wanted to really think about what other things could we do to making a better structures in terms of additional collateral personal guarantee things like that and we referred to it as rumble strips in terms of the deferral process as we get into the second go round were kind of looking to bump that up a little bit if somebody is looking for another days deferral of principal or principal and interest and those requests are going to get a little bit more elevated and at that point in time we also want to understand what is the game plan back to your original question how do you how is the customer planning to get to the other side and those are the that is the end game question for a lot of our customers as i talked about earlier were seeing those deferral rates coming down pretty dramatically i think as the economies reopen a number of our highly impacted industries have really seen substantial improvement and as we get into this next phase well really start to be able to see which of those industries within our portfolio still have some really long term residual impact and then were going to have to kind of one at a time walk through what is the end game for that situation but at this point then were mildly encouraged that the people who are coming in for deferral requests theyre not interested in throwing in the towel they see a path to being cash flow positive again and so were feeling okay right now edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think our method is we dont want to kick the can down the road ph lets just have an explosion of the compost pile later theres no way out our first loss is our best loss ph serve the clients and figure it out that way but as murph said most of these guys see an end and we do underwrite at that point in time if we can do anything in terms of rewriting the loan and doing it that way that makes sense to do it we do it but most of them they were underwritten properly in the first place their business hasnt changed that much to require that other additional collateral or other things that will benefit us brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great great color rumble strips i like that analogy good job working those down thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael young from suntrust your question please michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks quick followup on kind of the first loss as best loss comment just what areas are you kind of more aggressive and just going ahead moving problems out or you maybe see less opportunity for a recovery or a better market to kind of liquidate at this time maybe just any color there richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah i wouldnt say that there is an industryspecific issue there i mean i think that as weve disclosed in the release there are a number of highly impacted industries that generally speaking were feeling pretty good about one that we see in some of our peers being particularly problematic or two would be energy and hospitality have been really highly impacted for us its just not that many credits so we can look at those individually and try to figure out exactly what were going to do neither of those portfolios do we feel like we have a whole lot of exposure from a loss perspective too at this point in time so were feeling okay i think the one that is probably most interesting to me to see how it ultimately works out is the cre retail portfolio i think that thats one that everybody has highlighted for this quarter amongst our peers and certainly for us weve done a pretty deep dive understanding what that portfolio looks like we do think that there is a lot of room in that portfolio from an lpp and a debt service coverage perspective weve got a lot of personal recourse in there so weve got some handles to pull so in terms of just going in and doing a wholesale sale of chunks of the portfolio we just dont see that right now i mean there are certainly loans within the portfolios that have shown more stress than others but generally speaking the borrowers want to work with us and we want to work with them so i wouldnt say were cutting and running on any segment of the portfolio right now michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and maybe switching gears more of a strategic question maybe for ed but over the last to months you guys have been kind of growing the branch footprint with some infill opportunities and obviously doing some deposit specials i assume most of that activity obviously has been curtailed or suspended indefinitely but are there opportunities to kind of go the other way and cut some cost on physical distribution and infrastructure and what needs do you have on kind of the technology investment side in light of kind of the pandemic and new customer trends edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp on the technology side we are constantly upgrading our systems there under one of our main operating tenets which is same or better products same or better delivery systems ph going to service thats going very well and i think were very competitive there but the market moves very quickly so we are and we continue to make investments in the digital side of the equation on the brand side of the equation by the end of the year we will have completed a full review of our smaller branches to make sure that we are indiscernible one or two in market share in our branches ph wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 when we enter a period of time in terms of after years they should be one or two in market share some have not achieved that were going through a full review of those branches to see do we have the wrong people and the wrong locations some have been acquired should we close them so there are always opportunities there and we always look at them but maybe a little bit more wholesomely this time by the end of the year there may be some opportunities to relocate close or that side is i hate to say it but if this remote working and distancing becomes the new norm you need as many people in the branches than you use to have indiscernible end of the year looking at more remote work im amazed at how our remote work has done so in other words we are reviewing all of those expenses and just ph seeing how they go tim you have a comment on that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp no i think thats right were not giving up on the branch footprint by any stretch of the imagination and were seeing clients who want to use both our branches and the electronic services which is most banks point out are up over the last days or so but there are still places wed like to be as well and we think opportunities so i think itll be a selective review michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and last one for me just on the mortgage kind of comp expense or variable expense it looks like it was up about million yearoveryear and volumes were obviously strong how should we think about that going forward are we in kind of a higher variable comp environment for the rest of the year just given production volumes or anything like that that we should be baking into the model david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well yeah i mean if we did billion this quarter if we do billion next quarter we paid based on quantity of loans closed basically so depending on the average ticket size i would expect it to be somewhere if you went back down to billion then wed obviously lose more but we dont see that happening in the third quarter and my guess is with rates as low as they are that well have probably a relatively strong fourth quarter too with this because some of the closing dates the locks are much longer now just because the system is so full that its you cant close quite as fast as you used to so i would expect those numbers to stay elevated but its fine for them to be elevated because youre making the revenue on the other side so i would expect they wouldnt change dramatically in the third quarter base upon us expecting of a similar production in the third quarter michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question is a follow up from the line of david chiaverini from wedbush securities your question please wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hey thanks for the followup so you mentioned about retail cre and called that out i was curious in light of the moodys forecasts calling for the cre price index to be down possibly and of course its only a forecast and very well could not come true but down can you remind us what the ltvs are for the retail cre portfolio as well as cre overall richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah from the retail cre i dont have the cre overall but we did a pretty deep dive on our retail cre and looked at of the portfolio in great detail and the average ltv there was about now keeping in mind that thats based on the most recent appraisal and doesnt necessarily mean that thats what a current ltv is but it does give us it highlights i think the fact that theres room to move here and we typically have been pretty conservative over time and the other thing that i think is interesting in that analysis is that the average loan size is around million so it kind of highlights again that what we said in earlier calls that we do try to be pretty granular in that space we really dont have a lot of exposure to big box and to any regional malls so most of what we have is sort of the infill incommunity type stuff that has kind of been the bread and butter within our retail footprint david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks operator thank you this does conclude the questionandanswer session of todays program id like to hand the program back to ed wehmer for any further remarks edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you i have one further remark that a couple of emails i get it talks about high interest rates im saying longterm i dont think its going to happen tomorrow or next maybe in the next year but i think it has to happen and i think that you have this its such a cyclical business you have to learn from the past although there are different wrinkles thrown at you i think preparing for higher rates makes a lot of sense in my book and im not saying this could happen next year or this year or next year ph but youd only do much a fiveyear or sevenyear deals at because i think its got to happen eventually so i want to make that point clear weve always been indiscernible when it comes to that we talk about longer term and it seems like were swimming upstream but its always paid well and played off well for us so thank you everybody if you have further questions you know who to contact have a great week and stay healthy thanks operator thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in todays conference this does conclude the program you may now disconnect good day wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2020 disclaimer the
