stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks kerri and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call as you saw in our release this morning we had another strong quarter revenues grew on an fx adjusted basis and earnings per share was up over last year our investments to drive customer engagement acquisitions and retention once again generated great results and our credit quality remained strong card member spending remained at nearrecord levels in the quarter billed business was up on an fx adjusted basis over the record growth we delivered a year earlier led by the continued strength in goods services spending and the ongoing strong rebound in travel entertainment as we said earlier this year we expected the recovery in travel spending to be a tailwind for us but the strength of the rebound has exceeded our expectations throughout the year in the quarter total te spending was up from a year earlier on an fx adjusted basis driven by the continued strong demand from consumers and small business customers particularly noteworthy is the strength were seeing in te spending in our international markets which exceeded prepandemic levels for the first time this quarter on fx adjusted basis business travel also continued to recover and overall activity remained strong through september american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 importantly were seeing increased customer engagement with the wide range of travel and dining benefits and services we offer as part of our membership model for example bookings through our consumer travel business reached their highest level since before the pandemic in the third quarter and in dining our resy reservation platform continues to see strong growth since we acquired the platform in resy users have tripled to reach million and we quadrupole a number of restaurants available around the world on resy goods services spending grew yearoveryear the continued growth in goods services is supported by the structural shift to online commerce that was accelerated by the pandemic and has been sustained since then the new online and mobile oriented benefits we added to our value propositions these benefits are particularly attractive to our millennial sic millennials and gen z customer base which is our fastest growing customer cohort the investments weve made in our value propositions are also continuing to drive momentum in new card acquisitions we added million new proprietary cards during the quarter our highest quarterly level of acquisitions since the pandemic began and we continue to see strong uptake of our premium feebased products with acquisitions of us consumer platinum and gold cards as well as us business platinum cards reaching record quarterly highs millennial sic millennials and gen z customers are powering this growth comprising more than of our proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter as we sit here today we see no changes in the spending behaviors of our customers and our credit metrics continue to be strong with delinquencies and write offs remaining at low levels even as loan balances are steadily rebuilding of course we are mindful of the mixed signals in the broader economy as always we have plans in place to pivot should the operating environment change dramatically and weve been taking thoughtful risk management actions to be prepared in the event of a downturn but as ive emphasized many times before we run the company for the long term and make throughthecycle investment decisions our strong third quarter results show that our strategy investing in our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage continues to pay off and our performance is consistent with our longterm growth aspirations looking ahead we continue to see many great growth opportunities and we will continue to take actions to best position our business for the long term as youll recall our international businesses were among the fastestgrowing prior to the pandemic as more countries relax their crossborder travel policies and life returns to normal we see tremendous opportunities for growth in key regions despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties to that point we made an organizational change a few months ago to help seize on these audio gap we brought together our international consumer small business and large corporate management teams under one leader which will increase our speed agility scale and efficiency in our operations outside the us as a result youll see this quarter weve introduced a new international card services reporting segment looking ahead we remain confident that the successful execution of our strategy driven by our outstanding leadership team and the talented colleagues throughout the company positions us well as we seek to achieve our longterm growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth in and beyond based on our performance through the third quarter we also remain confident in our fullyear revenue growth guidance of to and we expect to be above our original fullyear eps guidance range of to american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 with that ill turn it over to jeff to provide a detailed overview of our q3 results jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thanks steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our third quarter results which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan starting with our summary of financials on slide most importantly our third quarter revenues were billion reaching a record high in the second quarter in a row up on an fxadjusted basis now i would point out that we continue to see a muchstronger us dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate so you do see a 300basis point spread between our fxadjusted revenue growth of and our reported revenue growth of as we absorb some significant foreignexchange headwinds of course the overall impact on our earnings still a headwind is less significant because we do have some offsetting positive impacts on the expense side our revenue performance in the third quarter drove reported net income of billion and earnings per share of representing eps growth of yearoveryear a great result considering the sizable credit reserve releases we had in the third quarter last year because of these prioryear reserve releases we have also included the tax provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter on this basis pretax provision income was billion up versus the same time period last year reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings before getting into a more detailed look at results let me spend just a minute briefly explaining how weve evolved our financial reporting for the organizational changes that steve discussed earlier youll see in the disclosures that indiscernible earnings release at the beginning of this quarter we have moved from three to four reportable operating segments we first took global consumer services and split the us into its own segment creating us consumer services we then combined the international consumer business with the international portion of small and mediumsize enterprises and large corporate creating the new international card services segment commercial services that includes us sme us large corporate and select global corporate clients and lastly our global merchant and network services segment remains largely unchanged and as always includes our global payments network and network partnerships you will see in the appendix of our disclosures that we have recast prior periods to conform to these new operating segments the new segments will also be reflected in our third quarter form 10q now lets get into our results beginning with overall volumes looking at slides and you can see the continued strength in our card member spending behavior that steve noted earlier total network volumes and billed business were each up yearoveryear at and respectively on an fxadjusted basis in the third quarter if you were to compare to third quarter billed business grew accelerating above last quarters growth rate of relative to and importantly despite the uncertainties in the current economic environment our spending trends with performance relative to strengthened as we went through the quarter we are really pleased with this growth and the fact you see strong growth across all customer types and geographies driven by both sustained growth in goods services spending and continued te momentum on slides through weve given you a variety of views of this strong growth across our us consumer services commercial services and in international card services segments and the various customer types within each starting with our largest segment billings from our us consumer customers grew at in the third quarter american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium us consumers millennial and gen z customers again drove our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing yearoveryear this quarter turning to commercial services you see that spending from our us sme customers represents the majority of our billings in the segment and that spending from these customers continued its strong growth up in the third quarter our us large and global corporate customers though a smaller part of billings in the segment remain an important foundation for the entire company and these customers continued their steady travel recovery this quarter though overall billings are still below prepandemic levels we do continue to expect though that this group will fully recover over time and lastly international consumer and international sme and large corporate customers within the new international card services segment were amongst our fastestgrowing prepandemic as steve said and are now in a steep recovery mode you can see our highlevels of growth in q3 at and yearoveryear respectively and if you were also to look at international consumer growth by age cohort you would see similar to the us that the highest growth levels are from our millennial and gen z customers who make up an even larger portion of overall billings than they do in the us one other note on overall billings the majority of our highlevel of growth this quarter was again driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network with some modest impact from inflation overall then we are pleased with the momentum we see acrosstheboard in our spending volumes which is tracking inline with our expectations through both the year and for our longterm aspirations now moving to loan balances on slide we saw yearoveryear growth accelerate to in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth the interestbearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarteroverquarter surpassing levels in the third quarter as customers steadily rebuild balances as you then turn to credit and provisions on slides through the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our strong credit performance writeoff rates for card member loans remain well below prepandemic levels flat to where they have been for the last few quarters as you can see on slide as expected you do now see the delinquency rates for loans have started to modestly pick up but also remain well below prepandemic levels turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide as you know there are two components to our provision expense our actual writeoff performance in the quarter which as we just discussed remains strong and second changes in our credit reserves where there are a few key drivers our loan balances especially our revolving loan balances grew strongly quarteroverquarter and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our models which was informed by thirdparty macroeconomic forecasts as well as the latest fed outlook was slightly worse this quarter relative to last quarter the combination of our strong loan growth and the updated macroeconomic assumptions resulted in a million reserve build this reserve build combined with low net writeoffs drove million of provision expense for the third quarter as you see on slide we ended the third quarter with billion of reserves with reserves for loans representing of our balances i would point out even with this quarters reserve build this remains well below the reserve levels we had prepandemic driven by our improved portfolio quality today compared to that prior time period going forward we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time but to remain below prepandemic levels this year i do expect to end the year with a higherlevel of reserves on our american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 balance sheet than where we ended this quarter given our expected loan growth the overall level of reserve adjustments will again be influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves in the fourth quarter moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the third quarter or on our fx adjusted basis before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that service fees and other revenue was up yearoveryear similar to last quarter the strong growth was largely driven by our recovery in travelrelated revenues our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in q3 on an fx adjusted basis as you can see on slide driven by both our sustained growth in goods services spending and the continued momentum in te spending that you saw in our spending trends net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear in the third quarter on an fx adjusted basis with growth continuing to accelerate as you can see on slide largely driven by the continued attractiveness of both prospects and existing customers of our feepaying products due to the investments weve made in our premium value propositions this quarter we acquired million new cards with acquisitions of us consumer platinum and gold card members and us business platinum card members all reaching record highs in the quarter and now each more than two times higher than prepandemic levels demonstrating the great demand were seeing especially for our premium feebased products moving on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear on an fx adjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances while generally speaking a rising rate environment would be a modest headwind for us due to our sizable noninterestbearing charge balances and actual fact it has been fairly neutral in terms of impact for us yeartodate over time though i would expect rising rates to represent a modest headwind to sum up on revenues were seeing strong results acrosstheboard and really good momentum when looking at slide i would point out that we have now seen six consecutive quarters of revenue growth above on an fx adjusted basis as we are now showing strong growth even on top of the strong recovery of that growth in the prioryear quarter i would also point out that we have a couple hundred basis points of difference when looking at revenue growth on an fx adjusted basis versus our reported results so while we are leaving our full year reported revenue guidance at to for i would expect to be above that growth rate range on an fx adjusted basis now all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments weve made in our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement costs these costs as you see on slide came in at total revenues for the third quarter roughly inline with what i still expect variable customer engagement costs to run for the fullyear at around total revenues on the marketing line we invested billion in the third quarter on track with our expectation to spend over billion in we feel really good about the strong demand ph in card acquisitions especially premium card acquisitions as we showed on slide and more importantly we feel good about the spend credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing into american express membership which continued to look strong relative to what we saw prepandemic moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the third quarter essentially flat to last quarter as steve and i have both discussed all year these results reflect the impact american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 inflation has had on our operating expenses in addition to our investments in other key growth underpinnings to support our tremendous revenue growth you can see based off our third quarter results that we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around billion for the full year in looking at the yearoveryear opex growth of this quarter it is also important to note that we see an impact from the prioryear including a sizable benefit from net markto market gains in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio while this year we saw a modest impairment charge more generally we continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage moving forward and wed expect to have far less growth in opex than revenues in our ambitious growth plan turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter including common stock repurchases of million and million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation our cet1 ratio was at the end of the third quarter within our target range of to we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth that then brings me to our growth plan and guidance on slide with each quarter of this year we have demonstrated consistent progress against our guidance and our longterm growth aspirations of delivering sustainable high levels of revenue and eps growth for the fullyear we are reaffirming our reported revenue growth guidance of to although i would point out as i said earlier that i would expect our fx adjusted revenue growth to be above that range and we now expect to be above our original eps guidance range of to an uncertainty in the level of our final eps for the year remains a poll impact on credit reserves of how the macroeconomic outlook evolves in the fourth quarter while i expect our actual credit performance and metrics to remain healthy its harder to predict exactly how the macroeconomic outlook might evolve in addition we are working towards our plan and expect revenue growth to remain above our longterm aspirational targets which should create a platform for producing strong eps growth of course well have to see how the economic environment evolves versus where we are today in any environment though we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth on a sustainable basis in and beyond with that ill turn the call back over to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri scheller bernstein headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning ryan jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe just to start on the topline steve solid results once again although clearly as you and jeff articulated fx was a headwind inquarter and i know you mentioned you arent seeing changes jeff mentioned the strength over the quarter can you maybe just talk about what youre seeing from a spend perspective maybe relative to what you saw 90days ago any changes under the surface and then maybe just flush out a little bit further your confidence in the ability to generate midteens top and bottom line growth into thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co were confident look the spending speaks for itself i mean just look at some of these numbers youve got goods services up our us consumers up millennial spending is up our te spending is up international spending is we havent seen any change and you could look at this quarteroverquarter and the reality is that last quarter was a record level quarter in terms of spending and this was like i dont know billion behind or something like that but if you look at yearoveryear growth were not seeing any changes in consumer spending behavior at all and look thats not to say that things may not change but i can only look at what im seeing right now and if i look from a forward perspective the question that we get is what about te can te spending ph hold so forth and so on and look i think you heard ed bastian last week and he talked about not only whats been going on at delta but what they see going on through the holiday season i think you heard chris nassetta as well say the same kinds of things and whats happening with hilton two of our biggest partners and so when we look at our consumer travel booking we see higher bookings than weve seen in a long long time i mean that goes prepandemic so if i look three out because the next question that people ask is what does the holiday season look like well the holiday season from a travel perspective looks really really strong because people are booking three months out and if youre going to be traveling youre probably going to be going to restaurants and if youre traveling american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 some place youre probably bringing presents with you as well so we dont see anything really changing over the next three months and as we go into next year we still feel really good about what our growth plan is and the only thing i would say is because i think i need to say this is that if things change we will be prepared to pivot and i think people saw that during the pandemic weve got our recession playbook you have a credit cycle playbook and well pull that playbook lever if we need to pull it but to pull it at this particular point in time doesnt make any sense were seeing strong growth and were seeing strong credit results overall so right now nothing new and the way i would headline this is that this quarter looks like the first quarter which looked like the second quarter and its the third quarter its another strong quarter for us and the only thing that i would say is i mean when you look at our model i think not only this quarter but this year it really shows the strength of our differentiated business model we have a different model than other people out there in the marketplace and i think thats coming through on our statistics yearoveryear earnings growth and the topline revenue growth is not something youre used to seeing from us unless youve been looking at the last six quarters jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co ryan let me just add maybe a few other comments to try to mention when steve and i use a term like well we know how to pivot if we need to i would remind everyone that gdp in the us shrank in the first two quarters of this year and weve been putting up revenue growth in the to range steadily right through that id remind you that i talked about our credit reserve is influenced by a macroeconomic forecast and so you can go look at what the fed said in september you can go look at what moodys is saying and they are predicting modest upticks in unemployment and thats contemplated in everything steve and i have said and in the guidance that weve provided if you look at october october is just a continuation of all that steve just talked about thus far so we feel good about the guidance weve given we are acknowledging the environment were in but i dont want people to overplay our reaction to the fact that growth has been pretty slow in the us because with our differentiated business model as steve just pointed out performing very strongly in this environment operator thank you our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed with your question sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i just want to follow up on that previous question stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc steve you talked about the recession playbook maybe we could just talk about your comments about operating the business for the long term and if we were to see a slowdown how we should think about managing the expenses marketing has been boosted quite a bit you wouldnt want to grow as fast as you are right now in a american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 backdrop so maybe just talk about the flex there how we should think about the aspirational targets in the backdrop of a recession or a mild one even and then jeff could you just hit the reserve rate i know people tend to think about that reserve rate as a result as it relates to cecl day one do you see yourself getting back to that level given how low losses are right now thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so if you think about operating sort of in a recession operating the playbook i think the first thing you have to realize is that when you look at sort of credit and you look at how you acquire customers and how you underwrite customers those are things that we do on an ongoing basis right and so we make adjustments daily weekly i mean the models are constantly being updated and changing and our return thresholds are changing and so as we say we manage throughthecycle when we look at indiscernible card members we manage that so that coming through that theres profitability okay and so we will continue to do that and ill point you back to the pandemic and what we did during the pandemic because i think thats a really good its a really good model for us so what did we do well you pulled back on your card member acquisition because number one we didnt have enough transparency at that particular point in time and number two maybe we werent feeling good about sort of the card members that we could acquire at that point but we never shut it down we still acquired card members so you would see that the only thing i would point out is weve been trending from a marketing perspective to spend well in excess of billion if you go back prepandemic that number was between billion and billion and so it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of delevering our marketing expenditure the other thing you have to realize is that a lot of our cost to card member services are variable in terms of spending and rewards as well go up and they go down as spending increases and so i have a lot of confidence in our ability to flex our marketing numbers down i have tremendous confidence in our ability to flex our operating expenses because operating expenses in a lot of ways go along with a lot of our volumes so and weve proven we can do that and i think our underwriting you would continue to tighten that up but thats something that we look at on an ongoing basis thats not something that you sort of just sort of cleanup when you get into it youre tightening that up as you go along and as you see any signals and then the last thing i would say is you get into credit and collections and your ability to help out card members in a thoughtful way and your ability to collect money and i think that a lot of the programs that we introduced during the pandemic were programs that we would be taking off the playbook and the last point i would say is our card base is not representative of the us economy when you look at the share of cards that we have in this marketplace and a number of card members its obviously wellbelow doubledigits and they arent necessarily representative of whats going on in the broader economy and the last point that i would make is a lot of people try and equate whats going on with the stock market and going on in spending there is no correlation in our history of that the thing that you do worry about is unemployment and in particular white collar unemployment and so as we think about professionals that could potentially be laid off thats something that you look at but again our models take all that into account and you know weve been through that kind of stuff before and i think were very well prepared for it american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co so before i get to credit reserves sanjay i cant resist just adding though you said well what would you do in a mild recession i dont want to get into the full debate here about semantics but some could argue that from a growth perspective were in a mild recession and we just grew revenues and to turn it to our credit reserves our credit reserve adjustments do include the latest economic forecast which has unemployment ticking up a little bit next year and thats included in all of our forwardlooking comments as you point out and maybe to help everyone sanjay i think its on slide in our deck today our day one credit reserve percentages of total loans were this quarter they were all the way down at i will point out that if you look across the industry that is by far the lowest percentage its also the lowest percentage relative to day one theres differential timing that all the different financial institutions have had over the last couple of years just due to the vagaries the way the accounting works here today but as you sit here today our reserve balance both on an absolute basis and relative to that day one basis is below the industry and that makes sense sanjay because we have by far the most premium book in the industry we have by far the strongest credit metrics and relative to prepandemic and that day one number our credit profile is stronger today all the talk you hear from steve and i and doug and others about our record success bringing more premium consumers into the franchise over the last coupleyears has an impact on credit profile as well so all else being equal you would not expect our reserve percentage of loans to get back to where it was day one cecl because the average credit profile is stronger than it was day one cecl operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark devries with barclays please proceed with your question mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks could you discuss whats driving the accelerating new account growth off of already higher numbers and how sustainable you view account growth anywhere near these levels to be any color you can provide on kind of the ramp in spend you would normally observe from new accounts as they age and then finally did you see a surge in new account applications from gen z around your jack harlow concert stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co i cant comment on the jack harlow concert not that i cant comment on it im not aware of the surge in account acquisition im sure it didnt hurt us look i think that what youve seen here is were not going out and just trying to grab the lots and lots of cards were out there were adding highvalue cards and the value proposition is really strong and the value propositions are really playing well with millennial and gen z at of our card acquisition and while i dont have the numbers handy with me in terms of how the ramping goes in sort of in year one spending here what i would point out is were acquiring of the cards that were acquiring are millennial and gen z and that cohort was up this quarter so i think this whole concept of generational relevance and bringing people into the franchise early and bringing them in on a premium product that they can really embed their lives into has really helped us out tremendously as opposed to bringing them in on a freefee product and trying to upgrade them along i think a plot of millennials and gen zs are using this product and again as weve always said its just a payment product we view ourselves as a lifestyle brand and as a lifestyle product and the jack harlow concert is a good american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 example of kind of the things that we do to embed ourselves in peoples lives and we talked about resy and we talked about travel and those services and those bookings are going up and people are using that and so its just more than just a payment product again mark i dont have the sort of first year rampup spending but is a pretty good indication as far as are we going to acquire million cards next quarter i dont really have any idea well acquire those cards that as we underwrite them they make sense for us to go they will be profitable throughthecycle could that be yeah it could be it could be it could be we arent having card acquisition targets what were looking at is acquiring those card members that meet our criteria and it just so happened that it was this particular quarter jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co the only two comments i would add mark are amongst the modest risk management adjustments weve made across the course of this year is we have significantly actually raised our financial hurdles required for some of the new card members that were bringing in and still just brought in a record level which tells you something about the level of demand that we see right now due to all of the traits that steve just talked about id also point out as i said in my earlier remarks that that average customer whose behaviors we track every single month is coming in with much higher spend patterns much better average credit quality and a much greater average fee component than what we were seeing prepandemic stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so its harder to qualify to get a card were getting more i mean just to cut to the chase operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks so much for the time stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just wanted to understand a little bit about how you thought the fx impacted yourself in the quarter i know we can see a variety of ways that you present but just want to understand from your perspective what the impact was on the revs and on the expense side in particular the rewards side and then give us a sense as to how you think about the revenue guidance range if it was fx adjusted for the year and for what youre expecting in the fourth quarter thanks american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so thank you for the question betsy i will say i think foreignexchange movement is very dramatic right now and more dramatic than they have been in many years i think they are a little difficult to communicate and hard for a lot of people to fully understand so youve seen dramatic moves in many of the currencies that are most important to us from the yen to the euro to the pound and so when you look at our revenue growth this quarter thats why you saw a basis points difference between the fx adjusted revenue growth and the reported revenue growth of now on the bottom line it is a much more muted impact betsy because of course we also have a very large proportion of our colleagues outside the us to go with all that business that we do around the globe the cost of rewards in all those countries is in the local currencies so the impact on our earnings per share is pretty di minimis i think we have a 10k disclosure where we talk about over the course of a fullyear movement maybe costing you a quarter so thats why i dont really call it out when you think about eps when you convert all of that into our guidance its why were very comfortable saying were going to be above our eps guidance range we left our reported revenue growth number the same as it was previously i would expect to be a couple hundred basis points above that reported revenue guidance on an fx adjusted basis so ill conclude by saying in some ways what were saying is our revenue performance has exceeded our expectations of 90days ago that has sort of offset the foreignexchange headwinds which were a little bit greater on the revenue side than what i would have expected 90days ago but at the bottomline you dont really need to factor it in that much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bob napoli with william blair please proceed with your question robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning love to get a little update on smb and online spending the smb obviously is a critical business for you and just obviously growing strongly but any color you can give on smb any changes and then online spend has actually been pretty steady a lot of i guess discussion around what is the right growth rate for online spend versus offline over the long run i think is a little bit of a decel and maybe an offline but steady in online so just any color on smb and your thoughts on the longterm growth of online spending stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i mean well talk about goods services spending which is really when you start to talk about online and offline look our goods services spending is and its the growth rate is split pretty evenly in fact offline maybe growing slightly more than online but both in that to range so and i think thats sustainable i think that obviously online spending popped up but offline spending is back above prepandemic levels so we feel really good about both i think consumers are drive past the mall consumers are out there shopping and spending and theyre also ordering online so i think its sort of a double hit for us in a very positive way so were very comfortable with the goods services spending and thats approximately of all of our spending american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 as far as small business small business continues to perform very very well and weve had in this quarter we had growth and its a large piece of our business and were doing more and more things with our checking account with kabbage and small business loans and so forth so we feel good about small business and it continues to perform really well for us operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please proceed with your question richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc guys thanks for taking my question i want to revisit the topic we raised last quarter historically your product offerings basically caused a customer base thats positively selected for spend and pay and the product offering essentially habituated them to a pattern now youre offering a product that offers revolve on day one and as you move into a younger demographic do you think over time despite the upward move in terms of the credit profile that that will change credit performance that you will actually increase your beta to the credit cycle because youve changed the way you habituated your customer and how youve selected them jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah so i think rick its a good question because you are good to point out that theres been a significant change as we have from our perspective added more functionality for all of our customers on what our traditional charge products and many to most of those customers still use them as traditional charge products and leave it paying off every days and some occasionally take advantage of their new functionality and being able to carry a balance if they want for a little bit but when you think about the impact on the company steve used the term a couple times today our differentiated business model if you look over time our net interest income is about to of our overall revenues and thats where it was many years ago and frankly thats where wed expect it to be many years from now because as much as we see an opportunity to get a little bigger share of our full consumer and small business customers lending wallet we grew fees this quarter and we are seeing tremendous growth in discount revenue so we do get great growth and expect to continue to get great growth on the lending side but i dont actually expect it to make a big difference in the overall mix of revenues that we have as a company or in the business model we have stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no i dont think its going to make a difference in the mix of as jeff said in the mix of our overall breakup of revenue and breakup of revenue but i think what it also gives us an opportunity is to actually acquire more spending and when we did not have that feature that group may have started off with a competitive lending card or we may have put them on a blue cash indiscernible card and so whats happening is and i think this bears out in the spending numbers of growth that cohort is consolidating their spending and theyre consolidating their spending with our product and its giving them an opportunity to earn more rewards and so i dont really think it changes the credit profile i think it gives us an opportunity to actually capture more spend and to ultimately capture more revenue and a more important part is i think the lifetime value of these customers is going to be a lot more than the lifetime value of where we acquired previously because were going to run these people right through were going to run these consumers right throughthecycle and theyre going to be with us from day one and i think thats really american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 important so i dont think it changes the profile of our revenue i dont think it changes the profile of sort of the riskiness of our company but i do think it gives us an opportunity to grow more spending and obviously to capture more revenue from this segment operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dominick gabriele with oppenheimer please proceed with your question dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey good morning thanks so much for taking my question the loan growth was up as you just mentioned about thats really industryleading levels of loan growth and i know youve talked about in the past that youre trying to penetrate your existing customer base and so youve effectively underwritten these people through their spending habits over time but you and you and a while ago i think you provided how much of the loan growth was coming from an existing customer base spending cohort and not could you just provide some of the breakdowns that are giving you this supercharged loan growth versus the industry again thanks so much jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co let me just start dominick with a few stats that i think are important and then steve may want to add i mean the biggest thing driving of course the growth in loans tremendous growth in spending right so we are in a recovery mode of spending and seeing tremendous progress there and customers are also beginning to rebuild balances a little bit so i think its very natural so yes i think when you look at those who have reported thus far youre seeing industryleading growth in loans but youre also seeing industryleading growth in spending i think thats very very important to put those two together so i think we feel good about the trends and expect them to continue and i would expect long term just as we were before the pandemic to grow a little faster than the industry on lending and to do it while still maintaining bestinclass credit stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and then i think whats also important to realize is that this loan growth is not all revolving balances here right i mean so thats an important point but spending growth like weve had will drive overall loan growth and yes its a weve had a large yeartodate sort of spend spending and growth but if you just look at it sort of sequentially quartertoquarter because we had pretty much the same card growth you only have about billion in overall loan growth on a sequential basis but you do have quite a bit yearoveryear so its not like all of a sudden this thing just jumped up spending continues spending has continued on a quartertoquarter basis and that drives up lending loan growth excuse me operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please proceed with your question moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks maybe as a followup i think jeff youd mentioned that the interestbearing portion had continued to grow faster kind of helping net interest income could you just talk about when that levels off how does that and i guess steve had sort of mentioned just in the answer to the last question a little bit about kind of a fair american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 amount of that growth in lending not being kind of interestbearing balance so as you look at that going forward how do you think that develops stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so i would expect moshe for the next couple of quarters to see the revolving or interestbearing portion of those balances grow a little bit faster than the overall loan growth because were not quite back to prepandemic levels of behavior i think our expectation is over time and i think it may take a while still you will eventually get back to prepandemic types of behavior the other factor i would point to goes a little bit to rick shanes earlier question which is you do have this evolution going on as weve added a little bit more functionality to some of our charge products so those customers who have the traditional charge products but have that pay overtime feature and to use it less than your traditional credit card or revolving customer so thats putting a little bit of complexity in tracking our numbers here but i think in terms of watching the macro trend i would expect loan balances to grow a little bit faster than the industry i would expect for the next couple of quarters the revolving portion to grow a little bit faster than the loan growth and i would expect all of those things to really set down into steadystate levels about where they were prepandemic operator thank you our next question will come from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo please proceed with your question donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes on the international org change does that signal maybe a faster pace of investment i know its always been kind of a balancing act in international markets and then also is there anything new on the tech investment strategy i saw you were sort of ramping up hiring seems a little late in the game for that stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no i think the tech investment strategy remains the same and i mean there was an article on us ramping up hiring and thats theres a lot of contracttoconversion that were doing i mean anybody thats in financial services has their own employee base and has a large contractor base and so its not necessarily an indication of increased head count in technology nor is it an indication of being late in the game what it is an indication of is a balancing act between our contracttopopulation and our overall colleague population so weve been pretty steady with our tech investment over the last couple of years and well continue that tech that same level of tech investment this year and what was your first question don donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co oh so international piece of this i think from an international perspective i just think that there is when you run a global company it is really important to make sure that you bring the best and the brightest to bear on all the american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 problems and issues that you have and when you think about acquiring card members engaging card members and retaining card members having a sort of a dual or a trimarket structure sometimes can slow down your speed and your agility versus having a single market leader looking at making what are the right investment decisions for that market and so how many small business cards we could acquire how many consumer cards we acquire how do you adjudicate what customers should get a small business or a consumer card i think this will allow us not only to get products to market faster but to also make sure that were putting the right investment in the right channels as we move across as far as extra money being invested in international we have an enterprise investment strategy and we will put the money where the best returns are so if we can get more returns out of investing in market a or market b versus the us or vice versa we will do that and the other thing that i would say look ive been around for a long long time and organizational constructs change for the times that youre in and for the technology thats available for the value propositions that are available i mean this is in some ways a little bit back to the future we did globalize all these things but now we feel its better to take these global capabilities that we have and deploy them on a much more local level with more local decisionmaking and more adjudication between sort of the various business units so we just think that will be a more effective and faster way and coming out of the pandemic i think speed of decisionmaking and agility will be really important operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning steve and jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi your ph ppnrb and the strength of the underlying trends certainly highlight the earnings power in the model but i was hoping that you could address investor concerns that thinking back to the timeframe your models back then were saying that customers with multiple mortgages were good credits and you guys essentially grew into that recession and while todays environment is very different some investors are looking somewhat by analogy to that timeframe and have expressed concern that you may once again be growing into the next recession and the strong spending trends that youre seeing are a reflection of the inflation problem that the fed is trying to fight would love to hear your thoughts around that dynamic stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co ill give you my thoughts and jeff can kind of jump in weve learned a lot since and weve changed quite a bit and to think that is indicative of how we handle i think would be foolish for and again ill just point you to the pandemic where i think one of the things that went unnoticed during this pandemic was how we american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 handled people in distress and i think we handled them very well from both a shortterm perspective and a long term perspective and if you remember when jeff used to present these slides during the pandemic we talked about ar in distress at times and we manage that quite carefully i can also say that our ability to collect is completely different than it was back then our models are different back then but i think people can think what they want but would be foolish to think that we havent changed or learned a lot in terms of growing into the recession what i would say is this of our growth is driven by transactions right now so if you look at that spending number this is not inflation this is transactions this is higher levels of engagement and so the notion of us were growing because we have some tailwind of inflation is also a silly notion because were engaging our card members more we have more transactions we have more card members and the last point just going back to your first question so is our card base is so much different than it was in from an economic perspective its a much more robust resilient card base than it was back in and also the way we grew our balance was not necessarily just through spending back then it was a lot of balance transfer activity and so i think this company is a very different company than it was in going into the recession the card base is different the way we were growing is different weve really become much more of a spend growth company we have a lot more premium cardholders we have a lot more feepaying cardholders than we did our growth is coming from very different sources so at the end of the day when and if you have a big downturn well see what happens but we feel pretty good about the abilities and we feel pretty good about our models and we feel really good about how our spending is being acquired right now so were not just riding a tailwind here we are riding real growth through customer acquisition and increased spending from existing customers because the value propositions are driving that growth jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and the only thing i would add is that just like that spend is coming from existing customers the loan growth is predominantly coming from existing customers that we know well who have a better average credit profile and we feel good about our winning throughthecycle models that tell us these are customers who we should have in any environment and i think ill come back to my earlier comments about our credit reserve levels are still below everyone else in the industry theyre below relative to day one cecl where others are and thats appropriate given our strong credit profile so we feel good about where we are operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lisa ellis with moffettnathanson please proceed with your question lisa d ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hey good morning guys thanks for squeezing me in stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi lisa good morning american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 lisa d ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc just a followup on hi on that point given the continued strength in your business and the fact that youre still benefiting from a lot of these sort of lagging recovery tailwinds from the pandemic can you just update us on your thoughts on taking advantage of the current valuation environment pursuit some tuckin ma and other more like chunkier organic investments for example things that youre perhaps looking at or leaning in on in terms of accelerating areas of your business thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co i mean chunky organic investments youve seen how weve driven our marketing spending and to acquire card members while as jeff said making it harder to get a card so i think that weve leanedin on our marketing investments we feel really good about our technology investments and look were always looking at opportunities to tuck things in that make sense for us i mean whether it was kabbage or resy or loungebuddy or acompay and so forth were always looking at those things that will be add will be adjacent and add to our organic core were not looking for are things that are sort of outside of our universe i think weve proven that we can expand with our customer base we can expand the services that were offering and looking at additional services that lead them to more spending or lead to more acquisition opportunities which when you look at resy people look at resy as a restaurant reservation system we look at that as a way to engage our card members as a way to engage with our restaurants and we look at it as a way to acquire new card members and so acompay is another one where its an ability to pick up more b2b spending so were always on the lookout for capabilities and if the right valuation comes along with the right set of capabilities yeah well take advantage of it but as far as leaning in sort of on organic investments i think weve leanedin i think weve invested in marketing weve invested in card member services weve invested in our value proposition and weve invested in our colleagues and continue to keep our investment levels up in technology operator thank you our final question will come from the line of mihir bhatia with bank of america please proceed with your question mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for squeezing me in here i just wanted to really quickly touch on the regulatory backdrop see if there is anything worth highlighting from your perspective specifically im thinking of the durbin proposal and if thats interesting to you there but is there anything else also on regulatory that we should think about thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co im sorry mihir it was really hard i dont know if youre on a speaker phone or it was really hard to hear you durbin is that the question mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc sorry yeah i was just asking about the durbin proposal and the regulatory backdrop american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co okay thats very clear now so look in terms of the durbin proposal its a proposal i cant speculate how this is going to come out and it obviously is not going to impact us because were a threeparty system so we dont really see that impacting us negatively will it impact us positively or will it actually happen we continue to look at it and well see what happens there as far as the regulatory environment its a tough regulatory environment and i think in a lot of ways we know the objective is to indiscernible consumers and to be transparent with consumers and we applaud all of that so i think the cfpb is talking about late fees and things like that and these are not material parts of our revenue streams but i think transparency with consumers is really really important and we obviously want to do all of that but i dont think the regulatory environment is any tougher than its been over the last few years and well continue to operate in that environment and obviously it adds sometimes it adds a little bit of cost to comply with certain things whether that means technological changes or what have you but its just like competition it really its always there and you have to make sure that youre investing to meet the regulatory guidelines and well continue to do that but i dont see it as a big headwind for us or a headwind at all for us as we move forward kerri scheller bernstein headinvestor relations american express co okay with that we will bring
