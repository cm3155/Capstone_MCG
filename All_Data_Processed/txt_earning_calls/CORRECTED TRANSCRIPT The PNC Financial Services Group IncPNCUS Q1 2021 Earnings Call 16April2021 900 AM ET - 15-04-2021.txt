executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan good morning everybody as you saw we had a solid start to the year as we grew revenue and controlled our expenses to generate positive operating leverage in the linked quarter comparison our first quarter results also benefited from our provision recapture driven largely by an improving economic outlook despite this recapture our reserves remain at over of loans as we continue to work through the covid fallout and work to understand potential secular changes on certain asset classes our capital and liquidity levels also remain at record highs with a rise in term yields weve been deploying some of this excess liquidity and increased our investment securities by billion at period end youll notice they didnt change much on an average basis as we bought later in the quarter we also actually added another billion in tbas that are going to settle early in the second quarter here and finally weve continued our purchase activity into the second quarter and we continue to operate notwithstanding this at very high levels of cash at the fed that can be deployed over time in loans or securitiesbased on market opportunities while not a surprise the quarter was impacted by continued weak loan demand in the face of strong bond market issuance levels paydowns and competition resulting in historically low utilization levels based on the strength of the us economy we would expect to see loan demand improve and ultimately drive utilization rates higher over time the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities including our national expansion which will significantly accelerate through our pending acquisition of bbva usa were making good progress on bbva integration planning and are on track for a midyear close pending regulatory approval we havent found any significant surprises regarding the quality or nature of bbvas business and our employees are working effectively with their bbva counterparts on everything including the technology conversion with the quality of bbva markets especially in their largest market in texas excuse me and the quality of their largest markets especially in texas and is proving to be everything we hoped it would as we plan for the integration of bbva usa we continue to invest in and leverage our own technology so that we can better serve our customers earlier this week pnc launched low cash mode which fundamentally changes the banking experience for our virtual wallet customers by allowing them to avoid overdraft fees through unprecedented account transparency and control low cash mode represents a shift away from the industrys widely used overdraft approach which drives customer dissatisfaction and which we believe is unsustainable we firmly believe this differentiated approach will drive significant growth in new and existing customer relationships over time as we execute our national expansion strategy low cash mode allows our virtual wallet customers to see and control whats happening in their checking accounts in real time if a customers balance is negative or about to go negative they have at least hours to cure their negative balance by determining whether certain payments are processed that otherwise might result in overdrafts this payment control is a significant differentiator that we believe will help customers avoid overdraft fees of approximately million to million annually pncs full year revenue outlook anticipated this fee reduction as did our estimate of bbvas ppnr contribution to pnc and as a result is not impacted by this change id like to close by thanking our employees who continue to support our clients and communities through the various covid challenges by executing on our valueadded relationshipbased model and with that ill turn it over to rob for a closer look at results and then well take your questions robert q reilly executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone as youve seen we reported first quarter net income of billion or per diluted common share our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis during the quarter loans declined by billion or due to lower utilization and continued soft loan demand investment securities grew approximately million or linked quarter however on a spot basis balances increased billion or as we accelerated our purchase activity near the end of the quarter due to the steepening yield curve our average cash balances at the federal reserve grew to billion in the first quarter driven by continued deposit growth and lower loan balance on the liability side deposit balances averaged billion and were up billion or linked quarter borrowed funds decreased billion compared to the fourth quarter due to the runoff and redemption of debt obligations our tangible book value was per common share as of march a decrease on a linked quarter basis primarily due to a decline in aoci yearoveryear tangible book value increased and as of march our cet1 ratio was estimated to be the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 regarding capital return our board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of per share or approximately million and as you know we continue to suspend our share repurchases during the first quarter as we await regulatory approval for our pending bbva usa acquisition assuming a midyear close we expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year slide shows our average loans and deposits in more detail average loan balances of billion in the first quarter were down billion or compared to the fourth quarter commercial loan balances declined billion or as overall utilization rates declined to historically low levels beyond that paycheck protection program balances remained flat as originations were offset by loans forgiven and within our commercial real estate business multifamily warehouse lending declined seasonally by billion consumer loans were down billion with lower balances across all consumer categories as loan demand continued to soften due to the higher consumer cash levels the yield on loan balances was a basis point increase compared to the fourth quarter however the increase reflected elevated commercial real estate prepayment fees and higher ppp loan forgiveness during the quarter the rate paid on our interestbearing deposits is now basis points a basis point decline linked quarter average deposits increased billion or driven by enhanced consumer liquidity primarily related to government stimulus payments in the yearoveryear comparison total average loans decreased or billion primarily due to the elevated drawdown that occurred during the first quarter of deposits increased billion or and again were driven by the high cash balances of our customers as a point of context consumer checking account balances are on average roughly higher than this time a year ago as a result our periodend loan to deposit ratio has declined to a historic low of at the end of the first quarter compared to in the same period in slide details the change in our average securities and federal reserve balances over the past year security balances of billion in the first quarter increased billion or compared to the same period a year ago over the same time our fed balances have increased nearly fivefold driven by significant government stimulus as well as the proceeds from the sale of our equity investment in blackrock as most of you know during we were patient in deploying this excess liquidity while interest rates remain at historically low levels however with the recent yield curve steepening we accelerated our rate of purchasing increasing our spot balances by billion with another billion of forward settling securities as of march average security balances now represent approximately of interestearning assets and our expectation is to build these balances to approximately to by yearend as you can see on slide net income of billion grew compared to the fourth quarter reflecting strong pretax preprovision earnings and a substantial provision recapture first quarter revenue was billion up slightly compared with the fourth quarter driven by higher noninterest income which was of total revenue in the first quarter expenses declined million or and remained well controlled the provision recapture of million reflected improved forecasted economic conditions and lower loan balances now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 turning to slide this chart illustrates our diversified business mix total revenue increased million compared to the fourth quarter of net interest income of billion was down million or primarily due to lower loan balances and two fewer days net interest margin of declined basis points reflecting the impact of higher fed cash balances importantly we think nim has bottomed this quarter and expect it to slowly rise throughout noninterest income grew million compared with the fourth quarter fee income of billion decreased million or most of the decline was driven by lower corporate service fees related to elevated fourth quarter merger and acquisition advisory activity additionally consumer services and service charges on deposits were down slightly reflecting seasonally lower activity and higher consumer cash balances and growth in both asset management fees and residential mortgage revenue partially offset some of the decline other noninterest income of million grew million and included higher revenue from both private equity and underwriting linkedquarter growth also reflected the impact of the million negative visa derivative adjustment in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago total revenue declined million as a decrease in net interest income from lower interest rates and volumes was partially offset by growth in our broadbased fee businesses turning to slide expenses were down by million or linked quarter across all categories primarily due to disciplined expense management and seasonality yearoveryear expenses increased million or and remained well controlled during the first quarter we generated linkedquarter positive operating leverage and as a result our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was we remain deliberate around our expense management and as weve previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by million in through our continuous improvement program and were confident well achieve our full year target as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business in technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide and reflect improvement in all these three major categories nonperforming loans decreased million or compared to december commercial nonperforming loans declined by million or which reflected portfolio activity as well as improved credit performance consumer nonperforming loans increased million related to residential real estate and home equity loans as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance total delinquencies of billion at march decreased million or consumer loan delinquencies declined million primarily due to lower auto and residential real estate and commercial loan delinquencies decreased by million net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million a decline of million linked quarter commercial net chargeoffs of million decreased by million driven by lower gross chargeoffs and consumer net charge offs of million declined by million primarily in our auto and credit card portfolios annualized net charge offs to total loans in the first quarter was basis points a decrease of basis points compared to the same period last year slide shows a million reduction in our allowance for credit losses during the first quarter portfolio changes represented million of the decline primarily driven by lower loan balances million of the release in reserves was related to economic and qualitative factors improvement in our economic outlook was the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 partially offset by increased reserves within our cre portfolio particularly in the areas directly impacted by covid in total our quarter end reserves were billion representing of our loans turning to slide i want to highlight the progress we made toward completing the acquisition of bbva usa notably we filed all major regulatory applications and have completed a completed a number of our key preclose objectives were on track to close the acquisition midyear and remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time that we announced the deal in summary pnc reported a strong first quarter in regard to our view of the overall economy our current expectations are for gdp to surpass prerecession levels sometime during the third quarter and for the fed funds rate to remain near zero throughout looking at the second quarter of compared to the first quarter of we expect total average loan balances to be stable we expect nii to be up approximately we expect fee income to be up approximately to we expect other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities and visa activity we expect total noninterest expense to be stable and we expect second quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million looking at the full year guidance we expect pnc standalone to remain stable yearoveryear in regard to both revenue and expenses we do expect revenue benefits from the higher rate environment and increased securities balances however average loans will continue to be a drag through at least the first half of we acknowledge some upside exists in spot loan growth during the second half of the year but that remains to be seen and as a result is not included in our guidance regarding the pending acquisition of bbva usa were increasing our expectations for the full year benefit to pncs preprovision net revenue from million to million primarily driven by refinements to interest rate assumptions consistent with last quarter this expectation excludes integration costs and assumes a midyear close and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so two questions one on your nii guide you mentioned up approximately thats for the first quarter but then in the commentary around robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc second quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc second quarter sorry robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yes thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and then in the commentary around your securities book you were highlighting that youre planning to raise securities book to what to to by yearend so i just wanted to get your sense as youre building towards your goal by yearend should we be anticipating that this rate of change of improvement in second quarter nii is something that we should be expecting could persist if the forward curve sticks around where it is in and as well the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc you want to answer robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure so yes again that was for the second quarter on the nii guide when we take a look at the full year and this is part of our guidance in terms of revenue being stable for the full year we do expect some more nii from our securities book as we increase the balances and thats going to be offset by a little bit less loan growth than what we were expecting at the beginning of the year so thats where we come out in terms of stable in regard to the building up of the securities book i mean its three things really one we have put more money to work because the curve has steepened second were going to continue to do that in a measured way and then third for the foreseeable future well be running as a percentage of our interestearning assets securities balances at a higher level so historically weve been approximately in the range were guiding toward more of the to range bill william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and betsy the only thing i would add is you said its kind of a goal its not really a goal its just our expectation robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc expectation thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc given the carry right now and how much cash were sitting on that the reason we put that in there is that our security balances and frankly for the whole industry are likely to run higher as a percentage of our total assets than they have historically and well keep adding to them throughout the year opportunistically as weve done you see that in the actions we took late in the fourth quarter sorry late in the first quarter if we were simply trying to drive nii we could have frontloaded those purchases at lower yields and had nii flat we didnt do that we waited waiting turns out to have been the right thing robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc ph yeah sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and youll see us do that youve seen us do that but youll see us continue to do that through the course of the year the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i totally get it its such an unusual environment here with the loantodeposit ratio so low and whats going on with the liquidity in your books so that makes a lot of sense and the revenue being stable for the full year with the loan commentary you just made i mean part of that is a function of the ppp rolloff thats expected is that fair robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah in part yeah thats all part thats all built in betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then on your william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah go ahead william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc was just going to say look the biggest unknown on loan growth specifically is when the inventory build starts for our corporate customers utilization is running as much as points below the peak maybe points below sort of historic averages and even though the economy is really kind of taken off here for whatever reason we havent seen the typical inventory build and capex that you would see in this economy i guess just hesitancy waiting for more certainty on the pandemic but when that happens and it will happen it almost mechanically has to happen youre going to see pretty appreciable loan growth we just dont know when thats going to be robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc particularly as it relates to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right and then just separately on the bbva usa projected ppnr that million up million from your prior guide whats driving that delta the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah as i said in my comments betsy this is rob its largely refinements in our assumptions around interest rates and some general trueups relative to the assumptions that we had at the time that we announced the deal betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but just based on our prior conversation is it more that youre expecting they have more asset sensitivity in their book than you thought before robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc not necessarily no indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no we had theres so many little things rates moved in our favor were doing really well on expense opportunities a whole variety of things and they ended up indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right trueups from assumptions that we made last november and the environments changed a lot william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and our knowledge robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and our knowledge thats right thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right got it all right thanks bill and rob thanks a lot appreciate it robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc ph for sure betsy operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research please proceed john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 hey bill wanted to follow up on the loan growth thoughts and were all just kind of thinking out loud here but could we see the inventory and the capex pickup but still not kind of see loan demand because corporates have a lot of cash and other alternatives in supply how much is that a factor too do you think going on right now william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc that will obviously impact our large corporate book which i think at the moment has its lowest utilization rate ever but the bulk of our book remember some 90pluspercent of our clients are private companies and so our middle market and commercial book really doesnt have access to the public markets and that cash build that youre seeing in large corporate so i do think youll see utilization there increase by the way weve seen utilization increases in our assetbased lending book robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc small but indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theyre small thats kind of the first place you would expect to see it so thats encouraging john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it and rob did you say that youre not building in a second half pickup too much in your expectation robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc were not yeah that is what i said john yeah because at this point its conjecture john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah and rob a followup for you obviously your capital ratios have gone quite high is it fair and i know you dont want to get into deal assumptions and all that but is it fair for us to think that youll end close the deal with higher capital than the pro forma just given where youre starting from now and could you remind us to just what cet1 ratio feels appropriate as a target for you guys longer term robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure sure on the bbva yeah i would say on everything well have a whole bunch of numbers for you once we close the deal but for todays purposes were tracking at or above all of our assumptions including the cet1 ratio so yeah my estimations are that it will be higher than that but well get into that detail once we own the bank in regard to our targets weve always said around thats been sort of the level that we felt comfortable with obviously weve been a lot higher than that so the relevance of that number isnt as strong as it was a few years ago the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc john youre asking the question are we going to have excess capital that can be deployed in share buybacks and other things and the answer is yes robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah and the deal doesnt change or how you think about the right capital level for the company robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc no no no john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey thank you for taking my question and maybe to revisit the loan growth thing so i mean you guys are seeing same trends as everybody else but you guys are a bit unique in terms of how much of the country you see are there any geographic differences on utilization or sort of hesitancy on inventory ph because i mean the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 i mean certain parts of the country just didnt necessarily shut down they reopened earlier more quickly et cetera i guess im just curious if theres any differences either geographically or anywhere robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc not particularly no we havent seen geographic differences utilization is low across the board william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think one of the issues is supply chains have been so disrupted that people actually cant build inventory r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and were strangely being held back by demand and production capacity r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah yeah that definitely makes sense its just such an unusual phenomenon but i appreciate the william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i appreciate the thoughts there and then maybe just more of a tickytack one the other fee expectation so it was a very very strong quarter this quarter i think the guide is a bit higher than is typical in the second quarter just maybe sort of the nuance rob on just sort of how youre thinking about that line going forward robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats we get some volatility on that quartertoquarter because theres a lot of elements there but the guide to the million to million is what we expect to occur in the second quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay all right perfect thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 operator our next question comes from erika najarian with bank of america please proceed erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning during this earnings season weve asked a lot of questions as analysts of when loan growth is going to recover from a cyclical standpoint but im wondering given the deal expected to close in midyear and as we think about how this could potentially help maybe bill talk through how these newer markets could potentially give you an even better opportunity to capture loan growth recovery once that come william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think thats going to be the case but i think one of the things weve been careful to do and sort of framing our expectations for you guys around bbva was we recognize that there are parts of their balance sheet that we would likely shrink both because of concentrations across the combined firm but also because there are some sectors they dont want to be in offset by our growth in these new markets so in the outyears i get really bullish about our growth potential but for the first year or so were going to and weve this is all in sort of the numbers we gave you theres going to be a little tradeoff of well be growing the business we want as we shrink some of the business we wont so the real acceleration is probably a couple years down the road erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and as you have made more progress on towards closing the deal can you give us a sense of you still feel like theres not going to be a significant amount of investment that you have to put into the combined franchise in terms of technology and other things so obviously some investors are thinking about another deal that had closed prior where there was a lot of investment spend that was a little bit of a surprise william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats the question william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i wont talk about what other people are doing but we pretty much have this nailed down we know and its all in the numbers weve given you we are going to invest in certain capacity for their branches for example on connectivity faster routers and were going to expand some of the compute capacity we have in our cloud but all of that weve given you and its not a big deal it was all on the deal assumptions and all those thing are proving to be correct the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys i just wanted to followup on the fee side to growth in the second off of what was pretty good numbers to begin in the first just wondering if you could help us understand just where your expected growth is coming from and what do you thinks going to lead that forward thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure ken yeah i would say on the fees as we look forward to the second quarter relative to the guide corporate services and consumer services will be up wed expect in sort of that midsingledigit range and then the other fee categories asset management mortgage and service charges on deposits probably low single digits so thats sort of how we get to that range ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then just as a followup on mortgage obviously not a bigger line for you guys but just given some the changes in the business you guys have been making and the relatively new platform just do you see share gain opportunities and is the fight just against gainonsale margins in terms of just how resi can continue to build over time robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc oh yeah i mean hey mortgage isnt as big as a percentage of our businesses as others but were very excited about what weve built and the opportunities that we have particularly the market will do what the market will do but particularly around building out the purchase side in terms of our consumer customers which will be expanded with the bbva acquisition ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay last little followup just rob i know you guys dont really give us a number on just premium am inside the bond book but can you just help us understand has it been a drag is it youre buying a lot of bonds youre probably still buying some premium bonds too just how should we just think about that big picture thanks robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 yeah its come down a little bit and wed expect it to continue to come down a bit ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc even with purchases right robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and it is in the numbers yeah even with the purchases ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it all right thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi in terms of the guidance for the acquisition so from million to million look the bank index is up since november when you announced the deal so i guess it seems logical that your benefits are going to be greater especially with a fixed price so what does that mean for and the ultimate savings i mean mathematically its if you look at the industry and you look at bbva of course it should be higher at this point its good timing can you say what it means for the next kind of couple years william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im trying to figure out where youre going with that mike i mean were going to once we once we close the deal well give you some updates on numbers and so forth i guess what i would say to you is we remain i remain and also even to a greater extent really excited by the outyear growth potential of this deal we tend when you do a deal you give kind of a year and a half worth of guidance when all the marbles are thrown up in the air and youre working on cost saves and integration the potential of the franchise in these markets is phenomenal the potential for crosssell and for growth of new clients is phenomenal and were really excited by that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess ill just wait until you close it and get more information for guidance robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc there you go the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and well have it william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay well let me get some concrete numbers from you i love what youre saying about the loan data i love data so when you say youre points below peak utilization and points below average what are those numbers and you also say corporate lending utilization is the lowest ever whats that percentage if i could have those that would be great william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so the only one i can think of right off the top of my head is our corporate finance utilization is of the peak number and i think robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc ph yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i saw some strange table robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats at an all time low william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc its lower there yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and thats a function of all the corporate cash the 11point drop was off of the high utilization we saw mike with all the draws during the first quarter of last year which is why the average is maybe and its hit certain areas have been impacted more than others municipal utilizations way way down as i said corporate finance is way way down even our assetbased business which typically runs fairly high utilization has really struggled just given the lack of ability to build inventory so i dont know if you remember the number rob but weve messed around with if you kind of regress economic growth retail sales a whole bunch of other different things against and inventory levels against loan utilization its an rsquared up over ph robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and it should be growing today robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we just havent seen it mike i cant give an answer as to why mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last one you said private companies are over of your customers as a percentage william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc of loan balances how much could

but youre not building it in your expectations even for the fourth quarter of this year so is that just you being conservative or william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah no its us saying look mike we could sit here and tell you all and ive watched some of these calls so the back half of the year is going to be great everything will be wonderful i hope theyre right and if theyre right well do really well but i cant promise you that the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc ph for specific timing william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc what we show you is the stuff we know i know that mechanically our loan balances are going to grow as the economy improves and they build inventories i cant tell you the timing of that by the way nobody else can either mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thanks a lot operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys talk about your deposit balances of course are up dramatically youve given that to us and bill youve talked about the utilization of your customers with the liquidity is that the number one driver of possibly taking deposits down or some of your peer a custody bank is not necessarily your peer but the custody banks are hoping for higher rates to bring their balances down how much would rising shortterm interest rates help you guys bring down your deposit balances to get the loantodeposit ratio in more of a historical relationship without having the loans having to grow dramatically william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont think rise in shortterm rates has any impact at all i think as a practical matter deposit balances in the industry are driven by the size of the feds balance sheet and fiscal transfers coupled with loan growth loan growth will actually drive more deposit balances once we see a pickup in that and i think excess liquidity in the system is here to stay for a long period of time because i dont think the fed is going to shrink their balance sheet anytime soon so i think were going to be in a theres a structural change in banking which is going to have more liquidity higher security balances for an extended period of time robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc foreseeable future for sure the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good which i agree with you guys on that as well shifting over to the allowance for credit losses in your slide i think it was slide you gave us good color on the levels and what drives those with the portfolio changes and the economic qualitative factors recognizing bbva is going to influence this number on the outyears but when you look at the reserves and you compare them to the day one reserves back in january which you guys show here youre still well above them and if the economy over the next to months is even going to be better than what we all thought on january prepandemic that would suggest reserves should come down do you think youd get close to that day one level or is that just too low robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc no i think you can get there to that level its just a question like as you pointed out in terms of timing so our reserves right now reflect our current forecast if subsequent forecasts are more bullish or more optimistic well continue on that trend but the timing of how fast we would get there gerard is per earlier comments difficult to be precise about gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure all right rob thank you robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc hey matt matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc can you talk about your interest rate positioning post the actions you plan to take in the securities portfolio and then also after you fold in bbva usa i realize there are some moving pieces but what would your expectations be in terms of how assetsensitive you are factoring those two things in william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were going to still end up being assetsensitive i mean largely because even with our suggested build the deposits were going to have with the fed are going to be quite large i would tell you that our duration of equity the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 and measured asset sensitivity has decreased as a function of the rise in rates but thats less about what were doing and more about the negative convexity in the banks balance sheet matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay any way to say kind of just frame how meaningfully levered you will be to rates i guess both the short and long end william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no i mean matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i guess put another way like you have a lot of leverage to rising rates now but as you grow the securities book ph to that much william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we still will robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were hardly going to dent it i mean the chart you see the chart we have in there where you see our cash balances versus security balances ph put any loan growth you want in there were not buying the long end of the curve and we have a massive opportunity to deploy that but as we always do were going to increment our weigh in by the way incrementing our weigh in is what gets us to that robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc right matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay and then separately im probably getting a little ahead of myself here but as we think after the bbva deal closes youve clearly shifted your view to wanting branches nationally and would the thought be to lead with organic growth or because youre basically folding them into your platform would you be ready to do another deal maybe quicker than normally william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 we certainly mechanically would be ready to do another deal i think like all things its a function of where you create value if its cheaper to go organically which it was for a bunch of years then we would choose that route i personally believe that we will see opportunities in smaller institutions simply because of the massive shift in technology and the cost of technology that weve seen to serve customers so i think low rates not a lot of loan growth big technology costs are going to give us opportunities to continue to create scale robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and well have those capabilities william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc bill and rob can you discuss how you guys are thinking about pentup demand dynamics for your consumer versus commercial customers where is there greater gearing to the reopening and how do excess savings and excess liquidity on both sides shape your view robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc well sort of our outlook for consumer lending is that sort of what youre getting at william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were trying to find your question there bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 yeah i guess just thinking about as we look to like sort of these pentup demand dynamics and sort of like the reopening and like kind of animal spirits being unleashed as you look to the second half of the year and all of that being a positive for loan growth like how does that differ between the consumer and the commercial side like theres a lot of liquidity sitting around on commercial balance sheets theres consumer has a lot of savings does that sort of delay like the rebound in balance growth on each side or are both sides going to be affected similarly or differently can you maybe give some color or perspective on that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i know yeah i see where youre going i think consumer lendings going to drag ci increase robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think consumers are really flushed with cash youve seen retail sales i think they continue to accelerate by the way but whats happening is that people who dont borrow are buying and the people who would normally borrow are sitting on fiscal payments that theyre going to have to burn through over time before you see balance growth were seeing massive transaction volumes so we see it in our swipe fees in effect but i dont know that youre going to see balance growth i think consumer will lag commercial and i get back this place where inside of commercial the smaller nonpublic companies and even some of the smaller public companies will continue to rely on bank balance sheets to fuel their growth bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats very helpful and bill maybe i could circle back on a question there id asked you a while ago about sort of the financial technology players like the chimes of the world and maybe just specifically on any color that you can give on perhaps how active you are in discussions with regulators regarding sort of the uneven playing field with many of these players particularly some of these players are benefiting from things like unregulated debit interchange which was never intended for them it was more for like the smaller bank exemption that it was intended for post durbin and so i guess is there any expectation of a leveling of the playing field do you see in the future or is this sort of the competitive landscape that is sort of the new reality william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so it is a topic of interest both on the political and regulatory side less about competition and more about safety and soundness and data protection and fraud and im not referring to chime specifically but rather new entrants into the payment space the exponential increase in fraud weve seen because of less robust know your customer rules and frankly probably just because of the covid environment all of that has gathered the attention of politician and regulators the competition side were happy to compete im somewhat shocked actually nobodys asked me a question about low cash mode that we rolled out this yesterday day before that product is a result of years of the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 technology investment that allows us i think is the only institution in the world to have effectively realtime capability of whats going on in our customers accounts and therefore showing them whats going on in their accounts and therefore empowering them to choose whats going on in their accounts no fintech has that go back to because they rely on these small banks as their back office which in turn are relying on 30yearold cobolbased mainframebased batch processed not very exciting core processors bring on the competition at some point they need to make money and to justify their existence our challenge is presenting and we think we do this a great proposition to our customers with ease of use and the very best products and i think we have the technology backbone to do that so im less worried about competing with somebody im more worried about safety and soundness to the system and data and disruption to our customers who dont understand where datas being shared and who has access to it bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful i was going to ask about the new service but i saw you talk about it on cnbc so i figured id save it save my question if i could squeeze in maybe one last one are treasury departments of any of your clients even remotely considering the idea of having some allocation to bitcoin weve seen some businesses move in that direction and with the coinbase ipo i guess it sort of seems like its a bit out of left field but perhaps you could argue is becoming more mainstream and so just wondering is that something that your treasury function is preparing for and then maybe on the wealth side are any wealth clients expressing interest in gaining exposure to crypto assets any thoughts on how you guys are sort of positioned for any potential emergence of crypto as a potential asset class especially in william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc the aftermath of that coinbase william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well weve been working on this long before coinbase went public back weve talked to coinbase about partnership and custody for our wealth clients practically weve had a workstream around this both for our corporate clients and treasury but also for our wealth clients the technology stretch isnt a big deal for us its more of a compliancebased issues that you would expect and then importantly choosing the right partners that you would choose as a trading transfer platform and importantly the custody platform so thats an open and continuing dialogue here robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and suitability and fiduciary the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah you can imagine that for wealth clients thered be a lot of disclosure around robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible your own risk robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc right right bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks bill and rob appreciate you taking my questions robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator we have a followup from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi the fintech comment got me to ask another question if you think about some of the players the bankers in the industry theyre starting to set up bilateral relationships even multilateral relationships with some big tech and thats an option versus going directly for the consumer especially with you going national now are you looking to continue permanently with getting customers directly or are you looking to partner more to lower your customer acquisition cost and go more broadly kind of like bankingasaservice as a plan b william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were going to get them directly look i think when you effectively offer your products as the lowcost provider to somebody else who owns the relationship youve just sold you sold your soul to the devil its the beginning of the end of your franchise in whatever space youre playing we need to own the customer relationship and we need to deserve to own the customer relationship through an offering that doesnt need that fintech platform on the front end its the alternative to that right and this is youve heard jamie talk about this as well if tech gets into the space and owns client relationships then we become a commodity provider industry with participants its a disaster you cant default to that end game you have to own the customer the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and when you think about the risk with data to the extent customers open banking and if customers optin to share their data with other providers does that force your hand more or how do you defend against that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think theres a lot of appropriate focus on data the cfpb i know is working on this as are various politicians and other regulators we need safety and soundness around data that is the biggest systemic risk at the moment in my view people talk about cyber but what theyre really talking about is data and disruption of account flows payment flows because data is corrupted the consumer that by the way is solved ultimately through tokenized apibased authorization at the bank for what the consumer wants to share not through screen scraping and were working our way towards that i think thats the ultimate end game but the consumer has to be empowered to share data but the data they want and to share it when they want not all the time and not everything and not to places that are otherwise in my view not regulated in terms of their controls around data robert q reilly a executive vice president chief financial officer the pnc financial services group inc and looking to monetize that data in some way william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator there are no further questions at this time bryan k gill executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc okay well thanks frank bill would you like to make any closing comments william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive
