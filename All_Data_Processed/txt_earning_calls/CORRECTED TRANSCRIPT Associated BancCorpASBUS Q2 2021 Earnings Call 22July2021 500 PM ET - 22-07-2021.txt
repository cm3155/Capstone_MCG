associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well good afternoon everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call joining me today are chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer now were going to get to our financial results in a moment but with this being my very first official earnings presentation since taking over as associateds president and ceo back in late april id like to start by taking a moment to reflect on what ive learned in my last few months on the job and why i think the future is bright for associated under phil flynns guidance associated built a strong reputation based on disciplined approach to credit capital operational risk and expense management as an outsider looking in i saw a clean balance sheet a strong capital position and a franchise known for great customer satisfaction these are all very attractive foundational qualities to build upon and qualities ive been able to validate since my arrival upon joining associated one of my first priorities was to listen and learn as much as i could both from internal and external stakeholders whats working well for our company what are our growth opportunities what we must do to win more customers and deepen community engagement we started with days of listening and a listening tour and we have held over largely inperson sessions with hundreds of colleagues participating and thousands of ideas shared throughout this process i have personally spoken with over colleagues across our footprint ive also spoken directly with some of our largest customers and many of our key investors and with this feedback in mind weve already taken several actions to drive performance across the organization first knowing that competing digitally is more important than ever we promoted doug peacock who was previously our director of strategic channels to lead our digital strategies going forward and build a comprehensive digital roadmap across our entire consumer and business bank secondly we have refocused our wealth management teams under the leadership of john thayer cfa previously our chief investment officer and a seasoned wealth management professional who will lead our integrated strategic vision for a business that already has many strengths and finally we are centralizing our fpa team to bring additional discipline to the execution of our line of business activities our cross group activities and importantly the growth initiatives we intend to formally announce later this quarter we are actively working on these strategies and initiatives and we expect to lead to additional growth and positive operating leverage we will communicate those strategies to no later than september now let me touch on the business environment in our markets and our second quarter highlights as outlined on slide the first half of has been marked by encouraging transition to a new normal we continue to see many signs of strengthening the strengthened economy in our markets many businesses in the midwest are running at full capacity in fact we are seeing really large gatherings gatherings such as those of our newly minted world champion milwaukee bucks which we just got to see outside our door today during their championship parade encouraged by these trends our frontline teams have been back and front of clients and working directly with our customers for much of the year were optimistic about growth and feel associated is well positioned to participate in the ongoing recovery associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 in fact we start to see signs of increase in lending activity and line utilization in our commercial portfolios which is reflected in our periodend loan balances commercial and business loans excluding ppp grew by nearly quarteroverquarter while the cre segment of our loan book grew by nearly and further our ppp and further our ppp portfolio continue to pay down as expected with periodend loan balances in ppp down over from the first quarter we find all of these trends encouraging we also began to see signs of increasing customer confidence in spending activity with deposit and card fees up million from the first quarter and credit card spend up quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear now shifting to credit we continue to be very pleased with the improving credit environment over the first half of which speaks to resiliency of our customers and to the resiliency of our core markets nonaccrual loans were down quarteroverquarter and net chargeoffs remained flat at just million after posting a negative provision of million in the first quarter of we posted another negative provision of million for the second quarter taken together chargeoffs and negative provision combined to drive a net reserve release of million for the period and finally weve repurchased million of common stock for the quarter and also added to our tangible book value per share now turning to slide let me highlight a few quarterly loan trends compared to the first quarter of average second quarter loans decreased however on a sequential quarterend period basis we saw solid growth in several of our commercial cre and specialty lending portfolios including reits general commercial and power and utilities as our customers began to modestly draw on their lines as expected ppp loan balances continued to decrease declining by million or more than as weve seen the sba accelerate their paydown and forgiveness processing we continued to enjoy strong mortgage originations during the second quarter weve originated over billion yeartodate but we remain reluctant to add lowrate mortgages to our balance sheet after seeing significant refinance activity in q1 this activity carried over into q2 driving our residential mortgage and heloc balances modestly lower during the quarter looking forward looking towards the back half of the year we remain optimistic around loan growth specifically we are optimistic about commercial loan demand and still expect full year commercial loan growth that is cre and ci combined excluding ppp of approximately to i would also like to provide an update on our indirect auto lending initiative as mentioned back in april we are expanding our consumer lending platform to add indirect auto lending to our product set we continue to build out the infrastructure and expect to begin booking loans during the fourth quarter of while adding auto allows us to diversify and add to our total our consumer portfolio at slightly better spreads we are also continuing to evaluate other consumer and commercial verticals with good lending characteristics slide provides a bit more color around the period end trends that are giving us confidence that we are on track to meet our full year guidance for commercial loan growth at june our commercial and business lending segment excluding ppp grew by for the quarter while cre grew by during the quarter as well combined these two segments represented roughly on a periodend basis which is in line with our full year expectations moving to slide we continue to see record deposit levels for associated customers and second quarter average deposits were up billion or yearoveryear this continued growth has reflected strong trends in our lowest cost deposit category averages which grew approximately billion from the same period a year ago associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 from a period end quarteroverquarter standpoint however we began to see signs of increasing business confidence combined dda balances from our corporate and commercial specialty segments which includes trust were down by or nearly million from the historic highs at the end of the first quarter we see this as a positive sign that businesses are putting their money to work in our economy during the quarter we also continue to work down our average higher costs network and time deposit balances which decreased by approximately billion from the second quarter of and on a related note our aggregate wholesale funding levels decreased to approximately billion at the end of the second quarter and have steadily decreased over the past five quarters in addition last week we exercised an early redemption option on million of our mediumterm bank notes which will also help our margin going forward on slide we provide a walk down of our quarterly pretax preprovision income or ptpp first quarter to the second quarter adjusting for the msr writeups and onetime gains recognized in q1 you have you can see our run rate has held steady and our net interest income is beginning to move higher with net interest income increasing we believe we have reached an inflection point on ptpp in addition the growth initiatives and efficiency strategies we will be rolling out later this quarter are intended to capitalize on our market strengths and position us to drive positive operating leverage and expand ptpp over the next several quarters we do believe the expansion in ptpp over the second half of will more than cover the incremental costs contemplated for the initiatives on deck so let me pause there and hand it over to chris niles our chief financial officer to provide a little further detail on our margin and income statement trends for the quarter christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy turning to slide we had previously indicated that net interest income and net interest margin would gradually start to expand over the last three quarters of based on slowing refinance activity a steady decline in liability costs and expected loan growth in the second quarter we started to realize the benefits of these factors with net interest income rising similarly while quarterly nim continue to be pressured we saw an encouraging uptick from month to month with the june nim finishing at up nicely from march slide provides a breakdown of the specific factors that lifted net interest income in q2 on the mortgage side margins and investment income were driven higher by decline in refinance activities which contributed to slower prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgagebacked securities we expect mortgage yields to continue to rise over the back half of the year as the refinance wave continues to taper on the commercial side we saw an uptick in ppp income recognition relative to q1 we had approximately million of unrecognized deferred fees remaining at the end of the quarter and expect that most of that will be realized over the back half of the year on the liability side we continue to see downward momentum in overall deposit cost quarteroverquarter this is especially true for time deposits where average yields have continued to decline periodoverperiod average time deposit yields finished the second quarter at just basis points and we still have about million in consumer cds with rates above set to mature by the end of the third quarter given the second quarters margin current cd rates and market trends we continue to expect our full year net interest margin to finish between and associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 turning to slide second quarter noninterest income came in at million up from million in the same period last year excluding abrcrelated income but down from the million in the first quarter the quarter overquarter decrease was driven primarily by a decline in mortgage banking income amid the tapering refinance ways partially offsetting this feebased revenues continue to expand led by service charges deposit account fees and cardbased fees feebased revenues overall increased by quarteroverquarter and yearover year as shown on the upper right mortgage banking gross gains of million were down quarteroverquarter due to sales margin compression despite the sales of whitnell which closed in the 1st of march this year we continue to see strength in our wealth management business wealth management fees saw a slight increase in q2 after a strong first quarter and were pleased to have ended the quarter with over billion of assets under management up yearoveryear given we are halfway through the year we are tightening our range of our full year fee income outlook to million to million turning to expenses on slide the first quarter came in at million in total expenses a slight decrease from the first quarter and a decrease from the same period last year personnel expenses rose for the quarter however other core expenses including occupancy continue to trend lower more than offsetting the additional personnel expense we saw turning to capital on slide our tangible value per share continues to grow quarteroverquarter and has increased yearoveryear to associateds regulatory capital levels also remain strong our common equity tier ratio has grown basis points in the second quarter of as we conserve capital in light of the economic uncertainty we saw over the last year we continue to target a tce level at or above and a cet1 level at or above with that let me turn it over to pat ahern our chief credit officer patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks chris i wanted to start off by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide we utilized the moodys june baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast assumes additional fiscal support a continuing low interest rate environment the recent acceleration in consumer prices to be transitory and a relatively localized covid cases following a net reserve release of million in the first quarter of we posted a further net reserve release of an additional million in the second quarter this net release was driven by gross reductions in our allowance for all of our core business units with a million gross reduction in our allowance related to our general commercial and business lending portfolio a million reduction in our cre allowance an million reduction in oil and gas and a million reduction in retail lending as of june our total acll was million down from million in the prior quarter similar to that our ratio of reserves to loans declined to from during the quarter we had previously guided that we expected acll to loans to drop back down to cecl day levels by the end of and halfway through the year were in line with those expectations turning to our quarterly credit trends presented on slide potential problem loans and nonaccrual loans both declined during the quarter with net chargeoffs flat from the first quarter our key covid commercial exposures also continue to decline notably oil and gas retail and restaurant exposures all declined during the quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 after peaking at billion in the second quarter of our quarterly active loan deferrals have continued to decline each quarter and fell to a total of just million across all core business units in the second quarter of total deferrals now make up just basis points of total loans at quarter end most customers who received deferrals have not needed additional assistance and they have been able to resume making normal payments going forward we expect to adjust our provision with changes to risk grades other indications of credit quality and loan volume with that i will now pass it back to andy to share some closing thoughts as we look to the second half of andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat on slide we recapped our updated guidance for we are tightening our noninterest income guidance and now expect the full year to come in between million to million reflecting the strong mortgage activity we see in the first half of the year and to continue to strengthen our wealth management business over the course of the year as a result of our ongoing planning for growth and efficiency initiatives we are withdrawing our prior total expense guidance before the impact of such initiatives we expected total expense for will be approximately million to million reflecting incentive accruals and additional business development expense now our total expenses for will ultimately reflect the impact of the initiatives that we will announce later in q3 but let me reiterate even with the expenses were contemplating to support our growth initiatives we still expect to deliver ptpp above our second quarter baseline in each of q3 and q4 lastly as mentioned we continue to experience positive credit trends due to economic conditions and as such we expect provision to be adjusted accordingly inclusive of risk grade and future loan volume with that wed be happy to take your questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey chris maybe the first one for you so yeartodate the margins are around so it looks like youll meet some good acceleration in the second half and i imagine ppp fees later this year are a big part of that but maybe to the extent you could would you mind please refreshing thoughts on sort of the expp margin i know youve got some of the cds rolling off or that that should give you a little bit of a tailwind but just maybe thoughts on sort of the exppp puts and takes please christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp absolutely so as i stated were anticipating to have the benefits and you restated now of the cds repricing which will come to us were anticipating seeing the benefit of having payoff the medium term banknotes which we fully paid off last week were anticipating to see a sort of stabilization of libor at hopefully what we expect to be slightly above todays levels as we move towards the back half of the year and were expecting to see loan growth and those four factors together will all drive our margins meaningfully higher from even where they were in june r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect and then similarly so on the fee side youll need a little acceleration to get toward the middle or high end of that range just curious about the main drivers it sounds like wealth management is going to be sort of a key growth area for you but same kind of thing maybe puts and takes you would see as we look into the second half of the year on fees christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp we certainly expect wealth management which typically sets its fees for the subsequent quarter based on quarterend levels to have a good quarter given that june was a pretty good point for the markets we also expect to see deposit fees continue to come in nicely and based on what weve seen in card fees indiscernible that can also be a positive as we move to the back half of the year associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect all right good thank you guys very much i appreciate it christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of michael young with truist securities please proceed with your question michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question this afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon michael andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey michael michael young q analyst truist securities inc and congrats on the milwaukee win i know that the hope was green bay but you take what you can get right andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp maybe its one of many michael young q analyst truist securities inc there you go step in the right direction so just wanted to follow up and maybe put a bow kind of on the expense commentary so i think you said it would the increased expenses would be kind of covered by the incremental ppp fees you expect in the second half so maybe if you could just kind of put a dollar amount on that and then on an ongoing basis are those kind of onetime expenses to put things in place and get people hired or is a lot of that going to be in sort of the longerterm expense run rate andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah this is andy let me just clarify that it is ptpp that we believe will cover that as opposed to ppp we clearly are seeing an increase in net interest income and so that increase in net interest income we believe gets buoyed even additionally by margin increases that we expect in the third quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 so right now were finalizing our growth initiatives we do anticipate making an investment in our company and recognizing the current environment that were in as we come through the pandemic but even after any new investments that are made in the third quarter or the fourth quarter we do expect to exceed the q2 ptpp in each of individually the third quarter and the fourth quarter michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful and thanks for the clarification sorry i didnt hear that correctly and then my i guess my other question was sort of more on the capital front just as you guys are looking at sort of deploying capital youve been active with the share buyback but theres also a lot of these kind of growth initiatives that youre investing in as well so just trying to kind of think about or understand how you guys are kind of weighing the payback period of various investments kind of across the platform and how that will pertain to future capital allocation andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah ill start that one out and maybe have chris piggyback on this one so as we look at our growth initiatives of course growth and funding growth is our number one priority so when we think of operating leverage obviously in a prudent risk fashion we dont believe we have to step out of our credit box we will finalize the initiatives and we expect therell probably be a shift in the use of capital a little bit away from maybe not quite as much on the share repurchase as much on the growth so as you have positive operating leverage you invest in businesses that drive your margin you do that in a prudent risk framework we think between the the growth will be number one and then well also of course look at what dividend strategy and share buyback strategy is combined so as we finalize those numbers well pull that through to the capital plan as well christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp that was well said andy michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay yeah i was going to ask maybe chris could kind of add a little bit more on the financial metrics side so are you looking at certain like tangible book value earnback periods or anything like that or recoup of investment timeline does your hiring teams are adding new origination platforms et cetera christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp we are and we look at those internal rate of return metrics on a variety of measures the good news is typically the addition of incremental adjacent lines dont have significant other costs other than people and people tend to pay for themselves very quickly so we are pretty encouraged by the early measures that we have and we look forward to announcing more of that news later this quarter michael young q analyst truist securities inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 okay thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks michael operator your next question comes from line of terry mcevoy with stephens inc please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good afternoon everyone christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon terry andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc a question for andy as you were out on the road the last days listening to your colleagues im just curious the ideas that they were presenting would you could you put them into called the expense bucket and then the revenue bucket kind of where youd kind of line those up and maybe just the technology bucket as well given the promotion to the individual to run the digital strategy what were the comments you heard internally on your digital platform relative to your competitors andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well yeah great questions terry and i guess what i would say is we have a serviceable digital strategy today but well be looking for a lot more and what im encouraged by in fact when i talked to doug peacock maybe the reason i promoted him is the first thing he said is dont be afraid to be bold and when we think about the world that were living in and the attack on fintechs we have a legacy trust advantage and so i believe this in my prior job when i took on digital and omnichannel i believe it firmly in this position so we will look at a combination of what our product strategy is what our digital delivery strategy is and certainly we will have to spend money in digital the exact amount of that is what were finalizing right now what id heard from our colleagues as well is we want to we want to grow we want to participate in the markets that were in inherently small business in commercial or local businesses still we expect to compete very well in small business in commercial and those will be a focus as were trying to finalize our plans as well so the things that i heard there and i in fact i heard it from the investment community as well and i think one time they said we want a reason to follow you and for you to be bold and thats what we expect to deliver on come september associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 or before when we have our plan so when we talked about evenly listening to the investment community our customers and our colleagues thats exactly what weve done and interestingly the feedback wasnt that far apart the thing that i find encouraging was when you start with listening and you get to as many folks as we have and it wasnt just me its our entire executive leadership team when you understand that the nuance of what is on peoples mind and you bring strategies forward that deliver on that you typically get by in an execution so its been a really good days getting to know our colleagues having a reason to talk to them in person getting to know them personally but also to know what they want from our company terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great great color andy and then as my follow up question reading here though there is a runoff now of the oil and gas portfolio which maybe i missed that last quarter but thats not my question i guess the million reserve against that portfolio and it was much higher on day one as that goes down should we expect then the acl ratio to move below that that day one level of andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp pat pat why dont you take that one patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes we do expect acl to continue to decrease below cecl day one specific to oil and gas as we continue to wind that down were less than of total balances in oil and gas right now so we would expect that trend to continue and that does have a big effect looking back to cecl day one in terms of the acl terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right thanks for that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks terry operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great andy i just want to make sure ive got the right starting point on the ppnr the guidance from here i guess is that like a mid low to mid like million run rate for q2 is that what youre using andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp let me pull that up chris associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp were starting with slide which has the ptpp on it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay i can look at that thanks christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and maybe kind of indiscernible christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe while youre digging that up maybe broader andy i appreciate the expense comment on the we have to wait for september do you envision laying out kind of mediumtolonger term just highlevel profitability targets roe roa efficiency i think thats one of the things that we would be looking for i just wonder if that was going to be included in that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah our plan is to show what the investments are what the payback period is and what that does to the key drivers whether thats our rotce whether thats our efficiency ratio whether thats our operating leverage those are all categories that we know that youre going to want to see and were walking through that right now to make sure that its what we need and expect for the company and externally so were very much trying to align with what we heard what our strategies are and how that hits our key ratios christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats thatd be great and then lastly can you just the cecl day one you referenced i missed that bogey that percentage that youre ultimately going to get to can you provide that again please patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 yeah were currently equal to where we started cecl day one at about so we can expect to see that trend down given where nonaccrual loans are going potential problem loans have decreased where it will flow down to well get back to that with our oil and gas it could get down to that range but we continue to watch that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon jon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of followup questions bigger picture andy can you talk about give us a little more detail on the centralized fpa and whats behind that talk about that a little bit and how it aligns with your growth initiative help us understand that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp absolutely look theyre fun things to talk about when you talk about driving revenue and you talk about changing culture and you think about all the good things you can do in product but those things are only as good as your disciplined approach to execution and so as we come out with additional initiatives all at once we want to make sure that our tracking is in place we want to make sure that we are clearly understanding the timing of each piece we want to know how that rolls up to our key financial metrics we want to make sure that that rolls into our monthly business reviews we want to make sure that rolls into our forecast and so having a team in my mind i see it as a best practice ive experienced that in my past stop and you really get down to the granular piece granular pieces of it and we know what to expect and we know quickly what we need to correct or emphasize and so when we bring that centrally under our cfo its still incredibly tied into the line of business however when were doing our performance forecasting budgeting and tracking of initiatives to me that was a really important thing that i want to have a view on all the time and so getting that in line as we make promises to both our colleagues and to the investment community i dont want to let either side down and i think this is the best way to get to that point associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats helpful on your listening tour and maybe pat or chris can add in in on this but what did you hear from commercial customers not necessarily on the reputation of associated but in terms of their level of optimism or bullishness on the growth outlook and maybe to pat or chris is it much different than it was a quarter ago andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp let me start that one out and then ill defer to pat as well i mean i was with of our customers last week and what im hearing is a general level of increased activity whether that be thinking about a buyout of someone whether thats ma whether thats thinking about equipment purchases there is just it seems to be the beginning of something so i believe that we see slight increases in our we do see slight increases in our pipelines we are seeing that slight drawdown on business deposits we see a slight increase in line utilization but more than that anecdotally i can tell you it is almost as if theres a pent up demand that is starting to move so anecdotally those are the conversations that they had and that weve heard theres of course talk about supply chain but some of them were saying gosh we have as much going on right now as we can handle now we want that to improve but to me that will be additive and that will not stop the recovery pat patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i would i would agree with that i think the some of the overarching themes were hearing is demand is outpacing supply theres a lot of catchup going on from last year obviously many of our clients still have liquidity and they are as andy mentioned theyre starting to deploy that whether itd be investment in new technology equipment et cetera and again i think like a lot of the country theyre dealing with supply chain and labor constraints that are really the only things holding them back jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks for that and then maybe one more for you andy bigger picture here but how do you think about the geography of the company and im thinking about markets like the twin cities chicago and st louis which kind of ring the perimeter of your franchise and i just theyre big markets where you have smaller share and im just curious how youre thinking about those markets thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah absolutely so look ill just do a quick overview northeast wisconsin we have a stronghold and we have really deep roots and meeting those customers you feel the presence of associated the value of longterm relationships we want to make sure we maintain those i moved to milwaukee and clearly a population concentration thats why im splitting time between milwaukee and green bay as inoffice time but we expect to do very well in milwaukee but with that you get discipline on the small business side and the commercial side and to me those are businesses you can scale without having a massive footprint so we would expect on the small business side and the commercial side to compete quite well in chicago in minneapolis we havent focused as much on st louis yet but what we intend to do is show that we can compete in the major markets then you look midterm and you build out your digital strategy and that associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 makes you attractive in every market rural urban large small and so that will be a point of emphasis for us on the midterm so thats how were thinking about it right now as we get into our growth initiatives and execute on those i believe that will open up optionality for us both from a market standpoint and then ultimately from a scale standpoint and potentially a second step in the merger and acquisition market jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks a lot operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon daniel andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just wondering if youre able to quantify the modest increase in line with utilization that you referred to a couple of times and maybe give us a sense for how far below prepandemic levels that those lines are andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill take that daniel this is andy we think we hit a trough a bottom in april and it was in the very low on line utilization and we were up at quarter end now historically speaking as we look at that thats about below what our historic numbers are so we think theres room we are not forecasting a massive increase to that but modest increase to that so were seeing evidence that that will that we clearly have room and we see capacity from our customers of over billion to drawdown so so we believe that the growth will be steady slow in the second half but that will be enough to meet that to commercial and cre growth target that we have out there daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc all right terrific and i guess on just also sticking on the commercial and growth side the if you have any commentary on what pay downs look like in the second quarter relative to prior quarters associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure we certainly saw a fairly healthy amount of activity but obviously in our core commercial books we had a net increase indiscernible and so for the overall bank obviously new
