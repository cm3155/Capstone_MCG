this time ill turn the call over to aaron aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you clint good morning everyone during the third quarter columbia generated net income of million or per share driven by solid fundamentals adjusted for million of acquisition related costs pre tax preprovision income of million was our second best quarter on record trailing only the second quarter of when we recorded a large gain on our visa b shares deposit inflows remained exceptional with balances up million during the quarter to billion at september representing an annualized growth rate of over the past months deposits grew by billion or our cost of deposits in the third quarter remained at a historic low of just basis points total loans net of ppp increased by million or annualized to billion at september remaining ppp loans totaled million at period end and the remaining net deferred fees still to be realized was million as of september we originated million of new loans during the quarter this new production has brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which compares to the overall portfolio rate excluding ppp of our investment securities portfolio was billion as of september which was a linkedquarter increase of million driven by million of purchases purchases had an average weighted yield of and a duration of years the portfolios expected yield is with a duration of years the net interest margin rose basis point linkedquarter to and net interest income rose by million overall loan income rose on a linkedquarter basis benefiting from the accelerated amortization of ppp loan fees partly offset by lower interest income from declining ppp balances excluding the impact of ppp the net interest margin declined basis points to reflecting continued asset yield pressures and increased balance sheet liquidity but as interest rates and the operating environment improves we expect our margin to rebound as existing variable and floating rate loans reprice higher and cash flows from the securities portfolio are redeployed into higheryielding loans noninterest income rose million on a linkedquarter basis to million part of the increase was from a gain on the sale of hsa accounts with the remainder of the increase largely due to higher loan revenue though all business lines posted solid results noninterest expense of million included mergerrelated costs of million for the merchants bank of commerce transaction excluding acquisition costs noninterest expense of million increased million on a linkedquarter basis much of this increase stem from a smaller fas benefit on the compensation line as the previous quarter had elevated loan originations due to ppp activity meanwhile the september quarter also had some outsized facilities maintenance and technology costs lastly the provision for income taxes decreased million on a linkedquarter basis to million representing a effective rate we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the range of to though the higher end of that range is looking more likely columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 and with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone our bankers have been busy generating strong loan production of million in the third quarter with nearly billion produced in the past six months outside of ppp at the same time we have actively replenished our pipelines which remain to our satisfaction deposits have continued to rise at an annual rate that has stabilized in the to range and fee income is up across the board we are winning new business by taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace because of who we are simply said we have followed a different process we believe that people want community and personal contact in their banking relationships and we have delivered on that on a multifaceted level quarterly loan production was predominantly ci and cre focused new business was centered in real estate leasing construction and healthcare sectors across our markets line utilization which has been low throughout the pandemic rose slightly to with commitments rising by million to billion and exceeding billion for the first time in our history the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio is now ppp nonppp fixed floating and variable the composition of the loan portfolio remained relatively unchanged as aaron mentioned deposits grew by million during the quarter and by billion over the past months the quarterly inflows have trended towards demand accounts over the last year and as a result the split has changed from noninterest bearing and interest bearing to an even split of between the two as of september fee income continues to be a bright spot card fees are up during the quarter from increased transactional volumes loan fees are up in alignment with loan production and cb financial and columbia trust company continued their breakout year with yet another record quarter residential mortgage activity remained strong in the third quarter with approximately related to refinancing and related to purchases as part of our ongoing branch rationalization process we consolidated three branches in september and october we have announced another new ph accrual in january of and in light of our announcement of the umpqua partnership we are now evaluating our retail delivery strategy across the combined footprint now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks chris this quarters allowance for credit losses remained at million resulting in no new provisioning for the quarter all of our credit metrics improved which offset any additional provision requirements for loan growth and a weakening economic forecast the ihs markit economic forecast we used assumes a full year gdp growth of for and for the current forecast is less favorable than the forecast used for last quarter when the full year gdp was forecasted at for we ended the quarter with an allowance relative to period end loans of and adjusting for ppp loans the allowance to period end loans increases to npas for the quarter remained stable at basis points past due loans for the quarter were basis points compared to basis points last quarter and net chargeoffs were minimal and only amounted to about or basis point annually problem loans which we define as columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 loans ph rated watch or worse declined from million last quarter to million as of september we are continuing to see credit quality improve across the whole portfolio including the covidsensitive segments when you compare it to a year ago when problem loans were about billion you can see indiscernible within the portfolio now while consumers are shopping again they may not like the wait time for their products or the sticker prices of those products businesses are dealing with supply chain problems as well as labor shortages all of this is causing increased inflationary pressures so we remain watchful of the impact these forces may have nevertheless we remain confident in the resiliency and strength of the overall portfolio clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andy we expect to finish the year strong as our bankers maintain an external client centric focus with the objective of growing our existing loan and deposit portfolios we have a deep bench of talented team members who in the coming months will complete the integration of bank of commerce holdings while working toward finalizing the combination with umpqua our current and future prospects are very bright and it is a privilege to lead such a talented team this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now norma will open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from david feaster from raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc i just wanted to start out on growth growth was again stronger than expected production is holding up well payoffs and paydowns are still a headwind but i just wanted to get some of your thoughts on the drivers how much is this strength you think just from a general improvement in the economic backdrop versus the new hires youve made in the client ppp client acquisition and just whether you think this high singledigit pace of growth is sustainable columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well ill start david this is clint and then ill quickly turn it over to chris this is something that i think is the result of a very intentional approach that we took in the middle of the second quarter of last year and that was a mindset of continuing to operate in a business as usual or in as near normal of a capacity as possible in spite of the pandemic and the disruptions created from that and i think that our thought at the time was that this would give us momentum as society started to reemerge towards more of a normal operating environment and i think if you look back at our growth in our production over the past four quarters youll see that that momentum has continued to build and thats why i think sprinkled throughout our prepared remarks you probably noted a lot of optimism and so ill step back now and let chris add some additional context christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah david i believe it hits on all of the things that were embedded in your question there but as clint said about our process i think a lot of the credit goes to our teams and how they approach being open being in front of clients being there when they had questions if they could still come in and make a deposit and they still have bankers that were actively involved in reaching out and talking to them thats helped with our existing clients and our retention but more importantly what we saw is relationships from other institutions that followed a much different process that are moving and voting with their feet if you will because of what we did and that we were open when clients dont have access to branches or to bankers they begin to look for other options and i think weve been the beneficiary of that so again i would say a lot of the credit and congratulations goes to our teams for being open in a safe manner and continuing to prospect david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just could you give us an update on the bank of commerce deal i know thats gotten somewhat overshadowed a bit but this is your foray into california just an update on how the integration has gone hows production trending over there and as youve gotten any deeper into that transaction now that theyre a part of the bank just any updates on your thoughts on that deal clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure it may be externally has been overshadowed by the announcement of our combination with umpqua but certainly internally it hasnt ill make my second trip to the bank of commerce footprint next week my second trip this month and hence my prepared comments about over the past several months getting to know our team members that joined us from boch and im excited im as excited or more excited about what they bring to the combined organization as i was the day that we announced it back in june and i think that with all of the things that we had envisioned our entry into california it was just that it was an entry and our strategy has always been to have a much much larger presence throughout california and the combination with umpqua accelerates that dramatically and i think that also accelerates opportunities that we saw with the bank of commerce combination or acquisition and thats having the size and scale where clients dont outgrow their bankers being able to continue to grow with those businesses being able to bring some of the business back on the balance sheet being able to pursue relationships that maybe they hadnt in prior institutions that were too large for the balance sheet at bank of commerce as well as additional career columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 opportunities and development opportunities that being part of a larger organization will provide to all of the folks that joined us from bank of commerce david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great and then just wanted to touch a bit on your asset sensitivity and kind of how you guys are thinking about managing liquidity at this point i guess whats the strategy going forward and i know you guys have been active and innovative in the past managing your sensitivity just with the rate collar that you guys have done just curious if theres any thoughts on swaps or other derivatives at this point just in light of the potential steepening of the curve aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc hey david no i guess derivative strategies ph or anything are being considered at the moment but we feel very good about our positioning in terms of our asset sensitivity id put in some additional detail or some new detail i guess i should say in our investor deck that helps you kind of better understand how the portfolio will behave but i think its also worth noting that the how we think about that and how we model that internally and what we share is pretty conservative one thing to think about is when you look at the say the asset sensitivity table that we put into our qs and ks that has a deposit beta sensitivity of about but if you look back at the last rate rising cycle the reality was that our actual performance was less than so our asset sensitivity is obviously very strong and were feel like were very wellpositioned for what we hope to be a rising rate environment hopefully in the not too far future certainly the trends that weve seen of late on that front in terms of some steepening of the yield curve are very encouraging and to further benefit that we hope to see a remixing from the investment securities portfolio into the loan portfolio obviously weve got tremendous on balance sheet liquidity and right now that investments portfolio has thrown off about million annually that we can redeploy into loans and that amount actually increases as we go forward so were very wellpositioned and comfortable about how that looks going forward especially in a rising rate environment david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thats great color thanks everybody operator thank you our next question comes from jeff rulis from da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 a question on aaron i might have missed in your prepared remarks the discussion on the margin specifically you mentioned anticipating a rebound could you frame that up again i apologize for missing i just wanted to get that straight aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc just nearterm my expectation is that were probably going to see continued margin pressure just given where new asset yields are coming on both in the loan book and the investment securities portfolio but with an anticipation of rising rates thats when we would expect to see a rebound jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so i guess the followup is maybe more specifically to spread income expectations and i think you kind of touched on a little bit with what you think you do on liquidity but if you do have broad nii expectations to ph ensure that aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc we havent given guidance on our nii expectations but obviously we had the benefit of ppp this quarter thats going to go away but now on a goforward basis of course well have the merchants bank transaction that is going to benefit that number on a goforward basis jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay great clint ive got two questions on the umpqua announcement and the first being youve had a couple of weeks to digest this and also get feedback from others and the first question being what do you think the most misunderstood piece of that combination that youve heard that youve had to sort of dispel and then the second thing is sort of the biggest risk that you see from combination integration et cetera thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah well i think the response to the to the first question and we stated this on the investor call at the announcement and i dont know that it necessarily resonated and that was the statement that we made that we are more similar than what the market perception has been and i realize that weve spent the past several months getting to know each other organizationally on a very very detailed level and so i guess as we progress towards the close and then through the integration i think it will become more apparent to everybody on the outside looking in that we truly are much more alike than we are different and so i do think that theres a bit of a perception issue there i think the biggest challenge to pivot to the second part of that question the biggest challenge going forward is as we go through the integration maintaining our external focus and thats something that im very confident in our ability to bring both our companies together into one its going to be a very powerful dynamic environment but i do think that that in some of these instances really in any type of merger activity there could be a tendency to become inwardly focused for a period of time and so thats something were very very much aware of and we spoke about the office of integration that were setting up that is very active we have steering committee meetings going already on that we have four of what ill consider very very bright minds in both companies two executives from umpqua two from our executive team that are going to be fully dedicated to that office of columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 integration and i think a good way of thinking about it is how we went through the ppp process and the first round for the whole industry forced everybody to become inwardly focused and it was an all hands type activity but then when we went through the second round of ppp we had a very similar outcome but many of our bankers the vast majority of them were able to maintain their external focus and that pivots back to davids question about the momentum and the growth opportunities that weve had so thats at a high level i think our plan to combat that risk and i feel really good about our prospects there jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co appreciate it clint thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe for you chris you kind of alluded to in your comments but what changes with your approach on expenses with the pending merger and kind of what are you spending on now and where are you maybe pausing a bit christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think when you look at our approach has always been one of consistency we dont put out a big announcement of branch consolidations its just the normal course of business i think with clint as our ceo weve always in previous calls talked about offsets when were making investments into technology and things of that nature and i expect all of that to continue to move forward now as we come together theres going to be opportunities the investor deck is out and talks about some of those opportunities and wouldnt expect that were going to change culturally who we are with our approach to expenses well run and well use the office of integration to highlight things where theres overlap where theres locations that have overlap and well work through our thoughtful process on when and how we institute those savings but i would expect that to be a collaborative process that has very similar results to what weve done previously jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 okay thank you for that and aaron can you review you threw out a couple of puts and takes on expenses to kind of get back to a core can you give us those again aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc sure so reported were about million right about million in mergerrelated costs there was about million and im going to call them technology fees that were well call them nonrecurring i guess but they were just unusual items we also had about indiscernible sorry in technology costs and then another in kind of some outsized branch maintenance costs that just kind of happened to hit during the quarter and then of course theres also the provision for unfunded commitments during the quarter that obviously can bounce around depending on utilization and commitments but that was also a factor in the quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good thank you for that a couple other questions the new loan production yields looks like theyre up quite a bit from the previous quarter is that simply mix or is there something else happening there clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc its mostly mix jon in the second quarter we had a as you may remember we had a few larger high credit very competitive deals that we had brought on so its really the mix jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good and then aaron another question for you i think you were talking about slide earlier with some of the rate sensitivity updates and i guess whats new on here i guess the way that i read it is it was a basis point hike above billion of your billion in variable and floating rate reprices is that the message youre trying to get across with us aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i think in particular the chart in the upper right gives you a sense but previously we werent kind of disclosing kind of what happens at each hike in terms of how that influenced kind of what comes out from under the floor or off the floor i guess i should say and so were just given a more granular level of detail there for you to kind of understand the pacing of how its going to play out jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good thats very helpful and then andy i think you thought youre going to get away without a question but how are you guys thinking about reserve and provision levels at this point obviously things look very clean but any thoughts on that andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 yeah i think its going to continue to be the dynamic between the economic forecast and i still continue to believe that the portfolio will continue to heal and then you got loan production so those are the three things that i see as the drivers going forward i mean certainly the economy i think gdp came out at for the last quarter so hopefully loan production stays there the pipeline i think is pretty good so its really going to be sort of that forecast which is a huge seasonal driver but we continue to see healing in the portfolio which is helping offset the declining forecast jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay thanks for everything appreciate it clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator thank you and our next question comes from andrew terrell from stephens your line is open andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey im looking at the kind of growth by portfolio this quarter i think a little over half of it came from residential real estate was this just from retaining more kind of mortgage production on balance sheet from your mortgage business and just given kind of the really strong deposit flows should we expect to see the residential portfolio continue to build from here as kind of a lever to deploy some excess liquidity or as i think about kind of the prepared remarks it sounds like the growth outlook was pretty optimistic so should we expect growth to shift back more towards commercial clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah andrew i think you probably understand it correctly we did choose to retain some mortgage production during the quarter we made a small purchase as well about million the metrics are such that it made sense that we would do that ci is still a big part of what were doing and when i look at the pipeline and go forward i would say that yes commercial is more of the driver of where were going but we saw an opportunity and it made sense during the quarter andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc understood thank you and then aaron i apologize if i missed this but do you have the yield for the new securities purchased during the quarter columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2021 aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc the new purchases were the average was and encouragingly weve seen an upward trend in that not surprisingly given what weve seen in the rising slope of the curve so hopefully well see that trend higher from here andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc all right got it thanks okay the rest of mine were asked and answered already i appreciate it operator thank you and i am showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr stein for any closing remarks clint e stein president chief executive officer director
