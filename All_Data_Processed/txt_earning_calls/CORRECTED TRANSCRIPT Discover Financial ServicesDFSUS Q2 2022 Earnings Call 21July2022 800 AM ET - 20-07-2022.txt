followup question after a followup question please return to the queue now its my pleasure to turn the call over to roger roger c hochschild president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks eric and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call im very pleased with our results this quarter we generated robust revenue growth and strong earnings while advancing several strategic initiatives this solid performance reflects the strength of our integrated digital banking and payments model and our focus on managing the business while investing for growth amidst an increasingly fluid macroeconomic backdrop lets turn to the summary on slide for the second quarter we reported net income of billion after tax or per share our operating metrics in the second quarter remained very strong loan growth increased by from the prior year driven by a combination of higher sales and strong new account growth and our asset quality remains solid across all products reflecting our focus on prime lending and our approach to underwriting and credit management we also advanced several strategic priorities in the quarter in our payment services segment we continue to expand our global acceptance through new partnerships in june we announced a network alliance in italy with bancomat one of europes largest payment networks this should provide our customers with access to merchants in italy through bancomats extensive acquirer relationships this partnership represents a significant advancement in our acceptance across western europe and we remain committed to expanding our international merchant coverage discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 in our digital banking segment our combination of industryleading customer service and compelling products continues to differentiate us in the marketplace we were recently awarded the highest ranking in customer satisfaction by jd power among mobile credit card apps and websites we also achieved jd powers top customer satisfaction with checking accounts for direct retail banks this recognition underscores our customer service model which combined with our compelling cashback rewards and nofee products create a value proposition that we believe others will struggle to match for this reason were confident that we are well positioned to generate substantial growth and shareholder value over the long term notwithstanding our strong performance we continue to closely monitor todays evolving economic environment slide provides some views on the current macro conditions measures of inflation remain persistently high and the federal reserve has signaled its intent to address this through restrictive monetary policy our business model has somewhat of a natural hedge against inflation as higher expenses are largely offset by the contribution inflation makes to our sales volumes and because our balance sheet is moderately asset sensitive rate hikes improve our outlook for spread income despite driving higher funding costs perhaps more significantly tighter monetary policy may have raised the risk of an economic recession but behavior and trends from our consumer loan portfolio currently do not suggest that a downturn is imminent our credit metrics remain strong and sales are robust even as our customers maintain high payment rates similarly most labor market measures indicate employment conditions remain broadly supportive of consumer financial health and credit performance nonetheless should there be changes in macroeconomic conditions well make the appropriate adjustments our throughthecycle underwriting considers all stages of the credit cycle including downturns and our history of conservative credit management positions us well for any future periods of economic stress our actions during the recent pandemic are a good example of how nimbly we can respond to changing circumstances we also maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position our current level of common equity tier is well above our internal target and regulatory minimums and as john will detail our reserves capture our estimate of losses over the expected life of our loan portfolio this brings me to one topic about which we want to make you aware as we addressed in our press release we are temporarily suspending our share repurchase program in light of an internal investigation being conducted by a boardappointed independent special committee this investigation concerns our student loan servicing practices and related compliance matters and while we cannot comment further at this time i can say this matter was contemplated as john reaffirms our expense guidance for the year in summary while macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain we continue to advance our strategic goals and are benefiting from the combination of strong sales and receivables growth expanding margin and slowly normalizing credit these trends give us confidence in our outlook over the forecast horizon while our reserves and high level of capital position us to withstand a range of macroeconomic environments ill now turn the call over to john to review key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone ill start with our financial summary results on slide as roger indicated we reported net income of billion which was lower yearoveryear however id like to call out two items the first is that in the second quarter of last year we had a million unrealized gain on our discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 equity investments compared to a million loss this quarter adjusting for these our earnings would have been per share in the current quarter second the provision for credit losses increased from the prior year due to a million reserve build in the current quarter compared to a million reserve released in the prior year the current quarter reserve build was primarily driven by higher loan receivables excluding the impacts of these two items our profit before tax and reserves wouldve been up yearoveryear moving to slide net interest income was up million or driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin nim was up basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially on both a yearoveryear and sequential basis the increase in net interest margin reflects the higher prime rate and favorable funding mix partially offset by increased promotional balances and higher funding costs receivables growth was driven by card which increased yearoveryear from strong sales and robust new account growth last year and into this year in the quarter the payment rate increased basis points and remains more than basis points above the prepandemic level we continue to expect that the normalization in payment rate will be modest this year and will continue through the back half of organic student loans increased reflecting solid growth in originations personal loans were up reflecting a return to growth we view this as a validation of our approach to marketing underwriting and pricing of this product over the past several quarters and we believe we are competitively positioned to grow particularly relative to some nonbank originators in terms of funding mix our customer deposit balances were flat yearoveryear and up sequentially increases in our savings balances offset the runoff in higher cost cds our strong asset growth may cause deposits to vary as a proportion of our funding mix but we continue to target to deposit funding over the medium term looking at other revenue on slide excluding the impacts of equity investments detailed earlier noninterest income increased million or this was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue which was up million or reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix partially offset by higher rewards sales were up yearoveryear with growth across most categories for the first half of the year our sales growth was we estimate that inflation contributed between and basis points to this figure strong sales also drove higher rewards expense compared to the prior year our rewards rate increased basis points yearoveryear reflecting two factors our standard category aligning with customer needs included gas this quarter second the substantial growth in new accounts over the past year increased the cost of our cashback match however on a sequential basis the reward rate was up basis point and up basis points through the first half of the year this is consistent with our expectations of to basis points of annual rewards cost increases loan fee income was up million or primarily driven by an increase in latefee instances moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were flat yearoveryear and up from the prior quarter compensation costs were up slightly yearoveryear primarily due to increased head count and higher average salaries like many organizations we are seeing salary and wage pressure which will likely continue through the balance of this year and into next year discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 marketing expenses increased million or as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products we grew new card accounts by from last years second quarter this speaks to the strength of our brand the relevance of our value proposition and the benefit of our investments in targeting analytics as roger discussed we closely track economic and competitive conditions and we remain disciplined about our throughthecycle approach to underwriting this approach contributes to our confidence about investing in brand and acquisition moving to credit performance on slide net chargeoffs remained low and were in line with expectations for continued credit normalization total net chargeoffs were basis points lower than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter total net chargeoff dollars were down million from the prior year and up million sequentially in the card portfolio the net chargeoff rate increased basis points sequentially or million looking at our receivables we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress at this point our delinquencies are virtually unchanged from the first quarter and while we expect some increases in delinquencies over the back half this is consistent with our outlook for steady credit normalization into turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide this past quarter we increased our allowance by million largely due to higher receivable balances our reserve rate continued to decline however dropping basis points to as a reminder our reserves are based on our expectation of life of loan losses on the macroeconomic view we believe the balance of risk has shifted to include the potential for an economic slowdown resulting from fed policy actions for us the most significant driver of losses is changes to employment conditions as roger mentioned the current labor market conditions remain healthy as examples the number of job openings still exceeds the number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate remains low but unemployment claims have started to creep up as part of our reserving process we consider the prospects of higher unemployment and a range of macroeconomic scenarios looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was well above our target the strength of our capital position is underscored by the recent ccars regulatory stress test based on the ccars results our preliminary stress capital buffer should decrease by basis points which effectively lowers our minimum required cet1 ratio to the lowest possible ratio we repurchased million of common stock during the quarter and declared a quarterly common dividend of per share concluding on slide as we look into the back half of this year our perspectives for remains favorable we are improving some elements of our expectations we are revising our view on loan growth to lowteens continued strong sales and new account acquisitions through the second quarter support our confidence in this outlook theres no change to our view on nim we continue to see basis points to basis points of upside for the full year relative to the first quarter level of our expectations for expenses remain at midsingle digit growth versus last year we still expect marketing cost to come in above levels with nonmarketing expenses to increase by lowsingle digits we are improving our credit outlook we now expect net chargeoffs to be between and for the full year and we intend to return to share purchases at an appropriate time in the future discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 in summary loan growth accelerated as we benefited from robust sales and strong account acquisition credit performance remained solid reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management we managed operating expenses while investing in new account acquisition brand and digital capabilities and our balance sheet and capital position are strong the results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model and im confident that we are wellpositioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions with that ill turn the call back to our operator katie to open the lines for qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions thank you our first question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is now open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc really thanks and really strong results in terms of account and loan growth maybe roger could you just talk a little more detail about kind of as you see the competitive environment youre adding a lot of accounts i know youve talked about how you kind of originate them with a throughthecycle approach but just talk a little bit about both how you see the competitive environment and how you see what youre any kind of tweaks you are making because of the current environment and talk about that in terms of the outlook thanks so much roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure moshe thanks for the question i would say the competitive environment remains intense with the consumer staying strong we are seeing strong levels of marketing from most of our prime competitors but i think our differentiated value proposition is succeeding well in the marketplace across all of our products from a credit standpoint i would say were roughly back to where we were prepandemic but keep in mind thats sort of a latecycle approach that we had towards the end of so we think we remain conservative on credit but the differentiation from the brand and the product are really working well to drive growth even in this competitive environment moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and just as a followup on the student loan side given that this is the key quarter coming up in terms of originations last quarter you talked a little bit about how you expected to have some advantages versus marketfunded players obviously theres youve got the issue that youve got from a compliance standpoint can you talk about how that could impact you from an origination standpoint and if that does how long that could last roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah we are moving forward with our plans for peak season again what has been a wild card over the last couple of years has been sort of overall number of kids going back to school and their demands for funding so i think that the market size is always a bit uncertain but we feel good about how prepared we are as we move into the peak origination months moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much operator thank you our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning roger and john you guys certainly have a historically remained profitable through the cycle with riskadjusted yields remaining quite strong youve been in a deep recession like we saw in and it makes sense that youre continuing to invest here against the backup that were in but could you maybe frame for us what it would take to curb your appetite for investing for growth and maybe just what it would take for you to have a pullback roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thanks for the question so there are a whole series of things we carefully monitor in terms of the health of our customers and portfolio and that goes into our appetite for growth i would say part of the things we watch most carefully externally are the job market and rising unemployment and so we have a finelytuned playbook in terms of how well adjust originations but we continue to originate throughout the cycle and so even during the financial crisis you referred to we kept up a certain level of account production even as we became more conservative in credit and our underwriting always uses a throughthe cycle approach as we think about the profitability of accounts were booking so those are some of the things we look to bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you and if i may follow up on that maybe could you also frame how youre thinking about the risk that the strength that were seeing in the consumer and labor markets is in and of itself inflationary and could leave the fed to have to do more and since we know that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags the increases in unemployment that follow those fed hikes tend to be quite lagged and so those effects could take some time to show up maybe could you just speak to that dynamic how that feeds if that feeds in any way into your reserving models we havent had a significant inflation cycle in a long time and so there are some concerns that current underwriting models may not be picking that up would love to hear your thoughts on that thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah hey bill ill take that one good question we spent plenty of time thinking about it so inflation unto itself is not correlated to loan losses based on all the historical data weve looked at now certainly weve seen some changes in consumer behavior so well keep an eye on it but typically it would be unemployment or changes in employment levels overall i have a particular view that as we try or the fed tries to deal with the inflation situation certainly its going to be quite a period of time before the job market is directly impacted in a significant way so unemployment remains superlow so theres still about million job openings right now versus million people looking for jobs spending remains robust and credit is performing very very well so as we look at those factors were going to keep an eye and see if theres any material changes on that but in terms of reserving at this point that life of loan approach that we take looking at broad macros as well as portfolio performance gave us confidence in the reserving levels we chose and the corresponding reduction in the reserve rate so well keep an eye on it and update it quarterly bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you roger and john appreciate it operator thank you our next question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess my first question is on the share repurchase suspension obviously that decision was probably not something that was taken lightly could you just talk about the thought process in making that decision given all the positive news on your excess capital and stress capital buffers and such i mean should we infer that the size and scope of damages could be pretty significant roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks for the question sanjay i think i tried to address that when i said our expense guidance that john reaffirmed includes our views on this matter so there are many factors that go into a share repurchase program its not just potential financial exposure and i would say returning our shareholders capital in the form of the repurchase has been a big focus for management and the board and will continue to do and thats why john said we hope to get back to the repurchase program as soon as we are able sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i guess a question for john just on nim obviously i think like the feds posture has moved towards more rate hikes im just curious your nim expectation is sort of unchanged but maybe you could just talk about what went into that and if youre seeing any changes in deposit betas john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks sanjay so the nim guidance gave a range of benchmarking off the and we said basis points to basis points range of upside from that based on the fed actions todate were tracking towards the upper end of that guidance range at this point so thats a positive discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 we are seeing deposit cost increase and thats a function of two things the competitive environment and then also the fact that we had a record loan growth in the quarter at so the funding mix as i said in my prepared remarks that will likely change in the back half of the year and were going to continue to focus on that so competitively were not going to lead certainly in terms of deposit pricing but were going to respond to ensure we remain very competitive and have a proposition a strong value proposition for our customers so how that translates into betas its hard to call right now but i would say the first part of the year we had a very very low beta i would expect that to normalize as the funding environment migrates sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator thank you our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan good morning guys thanks for taking my question when we look back at some of the changes over the years like the promulgation of the card act there were impacts that people thought would be cyclical that became secular in terms of loss rates in terms of yields im wondering when we look at payment rates today if theres something that you guys might see that suggest that this is more of a secular change than a cyclical change john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks rick so yeah its hard to call right now but we do have some preliminary data that shows that the decrease in the use of cash and the touchless transactions you may do at starbucks or other institutions where folks previously would use cash a lot of thats gone away so its creating a higher level of transactions through our card good thing for us from an interchange perspective but also that cash that folks use to expend i believe theres some portion of it ph that is now going to pay down balances which is increasing the payment rate now how much is that its hard to call right now were about basis points higher than the prepandemic level if i were asked do we give a range i would say maybe to basis points of that could be a permanent change and then the rest has to do with the strength of the portfolio and the strength of the consumers richard shane q analyst jpmorgan got it yeah its helpful and i agree with that conclusion it just feels like on a daytoday basis were all using less cash and im wondering if thats just driving more and more creating more and more transactors for you guys john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah thanks for the question rick anything else richard shane q analyst jpmorgan thats it thank you guys john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services you got it operator thank you our next question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning john good morning roger roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so john maybe a question on the allowance if i look i recognize that obviously this is a lifeofloan count but when i look at the level of reserve today youre only modestly below where you were at march of call it low versus high so could you maybe just give us a little more color in terms of whats assumed in the reserve in terms of scenarios and if we see a modest downturn just given how healthier consumers are like what could that do to both losses and the allowance over time thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services sure so as i mentioned in my previous comments we looked at a number of different scenarios but i can give you a couple of data points here in terms of unemployment it ranged from a low of at the end of to peak of and then as we look at to just about were seeing a level of gdp growth slowing we havent baked in a full recession but certainly gdp does reduce and is near zero in one of the scenarios we ran the employment situation still is robust and we certainly considered that as well so as we look out into were going to evaluate what the macro conditions are and the impact on lifeofloan losses but for me the portfolio performance really really strong the job market really really strong uncertainty on the broad macros and we conservatively model those so overall i feel like were consistent with how weve reserved in the past weve taken that throughthecycle underwriting approach that has benefits through into the portfolio and weve been conservative in our process to ensure that our reserves are fairly stated under gaap ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 got it and maybe roger maybe a followup to sanjays question i guess given that it doesnt sound like youre expecting much in terms of cost from this investigation i guess maybe just talk about audio gap spend the buyback and i know that youre limited in what you could say but any sense for the timing of how long an investigation like this could take thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah no i am to your point limited in what i can say we cant really give you anything to expect in timing other than you know our views on capital and so as soon as we can we hope to restart the buyback ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc i figured id try thanks operator thank you our next question will come from mark devries with barclays your line is now open mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks just one more question on the buyback when you are able to resume should we expect the cadence to kind of mirror what you did in the first half this year or could you accelerate repurchases john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services well look at that mark certainly we have that broad authorization from the board for over five quarters its billion to billion of repurchases so depending on the pause well see what we can do because certainly were over regulatory minimums were certainly over our internal target and as we said previously were committed to stepping the cet1 ratio down to so well do what we can do mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay great and then maybe a question for roger i mean just given kind of the pullback weve seen in fintech valuations is there anything that looks interesting here to deploy that capital inorganically roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good question i think while valuations have pulled back im not sure there are any bargains yet but for us weve tended not to focus on partnerships and potential investments as opposed to acquisitions and a lot of capabilities given our great technology team we feel like we can build ourselves so yeah we have a good business development effort thats always out there but i wouldnt necessarily expect something mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it thank you operator thank you our next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi your line is now open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just sorry back to the student loan issue just i know youve given all that you can comment on but theres also in the public we know that theres also a consent order related to this with the cfpb it looks like and i believe its even tied to a consent order from but did that impact did that influence the suspension and was there something new that developed that caused the internal investigation roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i guess the only thing i can say is both the consent order and the investigation are in the area of student loan servicing but beyond that there really isnt anything else i can add at this time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thank you thanks for helping there and then separately just on the this is sort of related to it but more around the expenses i know you indicated that the investigation is already contemplated into the expense guide and i appreciate that color does that mean that there were potential expense offsets that would help keep the expense guide unchanged or that getting back to your earlier comment that there is unlikely to be an expense impact john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so john the way i would think about it is were continuing to kind of run and manage our business and try to be disciplined in the way we distribute expense dollars and spend expense dollars certainly theres puts and takes in every single expense line and weve continued to have our foot on the gas in terms of new account acquisition and media which contributed to the marketing increases the rest of it is we consider it as part of the cost of our operation and were trying to make it as efficient as we can john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks for that if i could just ask one more on the credit side i know that delinquencies edged up a little bit yearoveryear for did you see any pressure incrementally in the lower fico bands or any color around the modest increase in delinquencies that you saw discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so what were seeing is the lower fico bands normalizing and you would expect those to normalize more quickly than the higher fico bands and frankly we consider that when we do our underwriting interestingly what weve seen is earlystage delinquencies across the board have corrected in laterstage buckets more quickly than weve seen in the past and some of that could be our some of the work weve done in terms of analytics and optimized time to contact and collection strategy that some of it could be just customer performance so theres really no takeaways from the portfolio other than it continues to perform very very well and gave us a degree of comfort as we reduced the overall reserve rate john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just on the investigation one for me here you did mention that it is embedded in your full year guide on expenses and im wondering if we should take that to mean that you expect the review will be finalized by the end of this year is that a fair conclusion roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services i wouldnt necessarily link those two i think what we can say is that we did not see anything that would change our view that nonmarketing expenses this year would grow in the lowsingle digits and we did indicate that we would hope to have it concluded but its done by an independent committee that reports to the board betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and the buyback restarting is a function of the investigation concluding is that fair rather than like a particular cet1 level roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 yeah the termination of the buyback has nothing to do with our capital levels it does not necessarily require the investigation to be fully complete for us to resume there are many complex factors that go into it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so its a bit openended on our end thinking about when to put it back in the model i realize you understand that so i suppose there will be a wide range of opinions after this call on that just on the business can we talk a little bit about the interchange rate the gross interchange rate has been really strong in recent quarters and wondering if theres anything in particular driving that are there increases in competitors that youre matching or is there something else going on thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah the overall interchange has largely been a function of the robust sales volumes so were up our sales were up through the first half of the year through the end of the second quarter so thats driving overall interchange now mix does come into play in terms of the interchange rate and obviously we dont spend a lot of time discussing that but overall the solid business performance is driving interchange and then maybe your followon might be rewards we did see a spike in rewards which to me wasnt a bad thing whatsoever what happened was gas was one of the categories in the quarter everybody knows about the inflation at the pump so we had a larger percentage of customers maxing out on that category which drove the rate up but overall the rate is we expect basis points to basis points of inflation there so interchange in the aggregate super strong interchange rate very very solid rewards coming in at expectations betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it yeah and that was the followup so appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question will come from meng jiao with deutsche bank your line is now open meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning guys and thanks for taking my question john you mentioned i think sales growth was up through the end of second quarter i wanted to see if that was sort of holding through the first three weeks of the third quarter and then are there any specific verticals youd call out in terms of sales volume john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so it is holding so through monday we saw so again incredibly robust those figures actually have surprised me a little bit to the upside which is nice were seeing travel increase obviously were seeing petroleum increase and the everyday categories have increased the one thing that we did see through the first half is home improvement spend actually decreased versus everyday spend so its still positive yearover year but not increasing at the same rate as everyday spend and other retail discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it that makes sense and then i guess secondly are you guys sort of seeing any change in consumer behavior in regards to the inflationary environment in terms of sort of any substitution effects or anything that any color there would be helpful john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah were seeing a little bit of it we believe that in terms of gas that theres certainly its significantly up year overyear but call it the volume of transactions indicate a certain level of substitution or decrease in consumption levels and then across the other categories nothing discernible at this point but we do we do expect in the second half of this year with a high rate of inflation that consumers are going to make some choices and substitutions or decrease in consumptions will likely happen meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you guys operator thank you our next question will come from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is now open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for taking my questions just one last followup on the student loan side you had your charge offs ticked off although theyre fairly low still on student loans but it is still higher than what weve seen from a quarterly run rate basis for the last few years is there anything related there to the investigation on why the chargeoffs may have ticked higher just in this particular quarter given credit metrics have been extraordinarily good within that portfolio roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah no those arent linked and actually i would view it as sort of a onetime move and we feel very good about the credit in our student loan portfolio kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then in regards to the outlook for nim appreciate everything for this year but as you look out further out just given the yield curve today would you expect some reversion back to your longerterm nim down to the low10 just given deposit costs are likely to remain fairly elevated as we go into next year or maybe even continue to move higher just given the short end of the curve moving higher combined with maybe a flattening on the long end is there anything youre seeing there that would cause nim to maybe start to soften as we move into the beginning of next year discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah good question so i would say this so my expectations is that nim will peak this year and there are a number of factors impacting it certainly you mentioned deposit costs thats going to kind of create some impact were going to have impacts on credit which will impact it but fundamentally our funding mix has changed which i believe will drive improved net interest margin versus historical levels kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you john operator thank you our next question will come from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is now open mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america good morning thank you for taking my question well maybe ill start with just on the ph well call it competitive intensity a little bit youre staying quite disciplined on rewards and operating costs even as you drive growth could you talk a little bit about where your account growth is coming from and the reason i ask is weve seen a few aggressive offers around cashback introduced in recent months thats historically been your bailiwick so i was curious if you are seeing any kind of impact from some of those offers out in the market roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah there are different competitors wholl do different offers we tend to try and be more consistent and sustainable so we like the the double cashback for the first year has worked very well for us so yeah someone will be youll see different issuers doing very longterm balance transfers we just dont think thats really driving sustainable growth and a lot of that promotional activity can drive sort of new accounts but not necessarily longterm relationships so we like our longterm focus and approach and it has served us well in a variety of competitive environments mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america okay thank you and then sorry and i dont mean to beat a dead horse here but one last from me just one question on the buyback suspension is that something that regulators require or encourage you to do while you get your arms around the servicing issues or was the decision to suspend buybacks just solely driven by you internally and dfs and the board roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah the decision was made by discover mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 operator thank you our next question will come from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is now open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thanks so much for taking my questions i was wondering how do you monitor wantversusneeds based loan growth as the consumer might feel some pressure both on an individual and a portfolio level how do you monitor that is there some internal data that perhaps we dont have access to that help you understand good borrowing behavior versus bad borrowing behavior outside of delinquency trends thanks and i just have a followup roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i mean its a bit of a different answer for the portfolio but for new accounts but i would say for our new accounts virtually all of it is wantbased right were not accepting anyone who doesnt have significant availability on other credit cards outside of potentially our secured card where some of those people we represent their first card so it really is about want and having a better value proposition than they are seeing with their other cards dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc okay great thanks for that and then i was just curious how long out does your throughthecycle loss expectation look out for changes in economic overlays so does it include today lets say through the fourth quarter of given our analysis we see that thats the rough timing where some of these macro dominos might fall into place with possibly higher unemploymentrelated net chargeoffs so how does the ph waiting work and the from a timing perspective of when you think an event may actually begin to occur and affect either your growth algorithm or your loss algorithm anything you can provide on that would be really great thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i would say we tend to look out roughly four to five years but it is not as sensitive in terms of whether its in months or years or years if you think about this is a longterm product and the cash flow is associated with the credit card and if youre not careful you can find yourself whipping around your new account criteria every week based on sort of the latest change in economic forecast so while we can react quickly if its far enough out youre not going to see sort of continuous adjustment for that and then for the portfolio its much more driven by accountlevel dynamics were really looking at the risk of individual accounts dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc excellent thanks so much for all the help operator thank you our next question will come from bob napoli with william blair your line is now open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you and good morning everybody really solid fundamental results great to see just the network leveraging the network partnerships and i know you have the areeba sezzle but just having this global payments network and just any update you can on your efforts to leverage that network i know areeba b2b payments is there anything else on the table there i mean that continues to grow nicely but just any thoughts there that make the network payments portion of the business a larger part of the company roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah great question so i did talk about one of our latest network to network deals so we continue to invest and expand acceptance and some of those deals do also generate volume and more crossborder volume for us we remain in a wide range of discussions with different fintech players truly around the world but we tend not to comment on deals i would point out too though we see a lot of value from the network not just in the payment services segment but for the differentiation and capabilities it gives our card issuing business and in particular the support it provides for rewards on debit which is a real differentiator in the marketplace robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you my followup was i guess rewards on debit because it seems like a pretty good opportunity for discover any updated information you could give us on cashback debit and the importance to your business over the next five years or potential benefits from that roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think long term it will be really exciting and a great benefit for the business and provide another entry point into the franchise versus most of our customers now coming from the credit card we continue to be deliberate in terms of how we grow that we want to make sure that were really solid operationally that we have the right fraud prevention in place but its a business were going to scale for the long term and again really excited about some of the early signs were seeing in terms of cost per account and the usage from some of the customers were putting on robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is now open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah john i was wondering on the funding side if you could talk a little bit about the abs market i know youve been a bit more active so ph have other card issuers are you pleased ph with sort of the discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 postpandemic from a depth and pricing and leverage perspective and also the same question in terms of brokered cds and john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah great question so im going to kind of break it into kind of two categories so very pleased with the teams execution when we go into the abs market i feel like the offerings are solid and the execution has been very very good the other side of the coin is when we were in that lowrate environment the allin rates on some of those transactions were unbelievable we were down at basis points so it took me personally a little bit to come to terms with something in the or right now but thats a function of where we are and relative to what were driving in terms of top line yield its still superefficient secured and an important funding source the rest of the funding stack continues to be stable the broker cds that you mentioned theyre pricing higher than our online deposits and were trying to get the right balance in terms of ensuring were competitive that were not a market leader in terms of deposit pricing decisions but also not having to kind of lean into more expensive funding sources but well continue to evolve there and make sure were making good efficient choices for the franchise donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks john operator thank you our next question will come from arren cyganovich your line is now open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks the stronger loan growth that youve seen recently and increase in your guidance for the full year how much of normalizing of payment rates is included in that versus just the continued momentum that youre having acquiring new accounts john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah arren thanks for the question very little so we modeled out a sustained high payment rate normalization back in through and frankly if the payment rate should reduce that would provide some more energy for growth we havent anticipated that the drivers of growth have been kind of the strong sales performance the new accounts that weve put on the books in the later part of and into and into this year and customers putting our card top of wallet so weve been really pleased and feel like the balance of kind of risk versus opportunity in terms of additional growth is probably more on the opportunity side at this point arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thanks and then secondly in the internal investigation obviously thats internal have you discussed this with the regulators already are they involved i just want to know if theres another leg so to speak to drop with respect to this discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2022 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thats something i cant comment on i would say though in terms of internal just to reinforce it is independent from the board but i cant comment on our discussions with regulators arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay
