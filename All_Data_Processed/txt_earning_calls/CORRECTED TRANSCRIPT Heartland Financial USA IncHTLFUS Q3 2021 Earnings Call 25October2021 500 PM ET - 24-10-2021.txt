of in the network htlf is in the process of finalizing an evaluation of consolidating our separate bank charters into a single charter to drive efficiency improve agility reduce expenses and enhance scalability we are wellpositioned to consolidate our bank charters we already successfully operate a wellintegrated shared services model and consolidating charters will yield additional benefits

and local boards second htlf will maintain its strong and sizeable presence in dubuque iowa currently htlf current htlf operational and administrative functions will continue to be largely staffed and run from dubuque when completed we expect to achieve annualized revenue opportunities and expense reductions totaling to of our current cost base while other institutions may have achieved greater savings in their charter consolidation initiatives our savings may be somewhat lower as we already operate a wellintegrated and mature shared services model we expect to communicate more details when the evaluation is complete later in the fourth quarter lastly i want to acknowledge our employees im proud of how they continue to adjust adapt and advance im grateful for their hard work and dedication it has strengthened our company and delivered strength insight and growth to our customers communities and shareholders together we are htlf i will now turn the call over to bryan mckeag htlfs chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today by referencing our earnings release which details another solid quarter for htlf with earnings per share reported at loan growth of million excluding ppp loan forgiveness improved credit metrics and continued deposit growth before i go into my comments i would remind you that you can find additional information on the quarter in the third quarter investor presentation which is available in the ir section of htlfs website heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 so ill start my comments with the provision for credit losses which was a million benefit this quarter and primarily driven by improved underlying credit metrics highlighted by loan upgrades exceeding downgrades a million decrease in nonperforming loans a record low level of loan delinquencies and million in net recoveries on previously chargedoff loans the economic outlook factors used to develop the allowance were largely unchanged from last quarter and still retained a measured level of caution and uncertainty that management deems appropriate for lingering economic headwinds that are yet to be resolved at quarter end the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments stood at million or of total loans when the ppp loan balances are excluded the total allowance stands at compared to at june at quarter end unamortized purchased loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled million or basis points of total loans excluding ppp moving to the rest of the balance sheet investments grew million this quarter and comprised just over of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just over five years and generates million to million of monthly cash flow borrowings increased million to end the quarter at million or of assets the increase this quarter includes both the issuance of million fixed rate subdebt and the retirement of a million fixed rate holding company loan the tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to at quarter end the decrease was a result of basis points decline due to the decrease in market value of investments and another basis points decline due to the significant balance sheet growth this quarter these were partially offset by a 22basispoint increase from higher retained earnings heartlands regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier at just under and the total risk based now over with the inclusion of the million in subdebt we issued this quarter so the balance sheet continues to be very strong and wellpositioned moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million higher than the prior quarter ppp interest and fees recognized this quarter was million which was unchanged from last quarter we exited the quarter with just under million of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books the net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis this quarter was thats down basis points compared to last quarter during the quarter a 10basispoint decline in investment yields was partially offset by a 2basispoint increase in loan yields and a 1basispoint drop in interest costs this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was down basis point from the prior quarter noninterest income totaled million for the quarter from last quarter thats down from last quarter total mortgage banking revenue was up million which was offset by security gains which decreased million compared to last quarter in addition service charges were higher and trust fees were up representing increases in each category compared to last quarter shifting to noninterest expense noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter up million from last quarter excluding acquisition integration restructuring and tax credit costs and asset gains and losses core expenses increased just over million to million compared to million last quarter the increase is attributed to several items including a million increase in salary and benefits costs related to the addition of heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 the new lending teams some wage inflation pressure and higher benefit costs as our employees have started to utilize the healthcare system at more normalized levels the remaining increase is primarily due to fdic insurance assessments which rose due to higher deposit levels and higher costs for security legal and account losses related to increases and claims and productivity this quarter looking ahead to the final quarter of and into we believe htlf will continue to deliver strong results highlighted by loan pipelines that remain strong leading to an expected growth rate exppp in a range per quarter as the economy continues to strengthen remaining ppp loan forgiveness will happen largely over the next two quarters we anticipate that ppp reductions will be replaced by nonppp growth nontime deposits growth is likely to slow into the range per quarter net interest margin will continue to be pressured however net interest income excluding ppp fees is projected to grow modestly as earning assets grow and mix improves going forward provision for credit losses are expected to remain low for the next quarter or two and then begin to normalize as loan growth continues the economy stabilizes and covid and supply chain issues subside in noninterest income excluding investment gains or losses in total is expected to be flat next quarter at about million we expect to see yearoveryear lift in core noninterest income in the range next year core expenses are expected to remain flat in the million range next quarter we intend to manage core expenses to a modest yearoveryear increase in however persistent or increasing inflationary pressures could be a difficult headwind we believe a core tax rate that excludes new tax credits is a reasonable full year run rate assuming no tax law changes and lastly we expect the tce ratio will climb back above next quarter as we get a basis points to basis points increase from retained earnings however a continued upward movement in interest rates could weigh negatively on the ratio and with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks bryan towanda if you want to open up the line well take questions now heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi just a question on the charter collapse i guess analysis its still to be determined but there sort of the trigger on that i mean thats certainly been discussed for years and youve stayed on that platform and really i guess effectively not a lot of changes just interested in trigger for the timing of that i know that youve done a lot of internal work for years now just wanted to kind of get a sense for the timeline of kind of why now in that discussion bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so jeff this is bruce i think a couple of reasons first of all we had to make sure that we had a foundation internally so that we could actually execute on a charter collapse we actually have that in place now i think the second thing is weve gotten larger that also was one of the factors as well and we just felt that this was the right time to do it especially with the pressure on both margin and expenses that this will be an opportunity for us to continue to reduce our efficiency ratio over time and weve also been reducing the number of physical branch locations as well bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think the other thing i would add jeff is when we do acquisitions and have been doing acquisitions into our model a model that has one charter and the ability to do bigger deals and set them the way that we want within the company will be easier if we dont have to worry about the separate charter demarcations and so that will make it easier along with other internal things in our back office bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 yeah and just to follow up on bryans comment our last acquisition aimbank they had geographies that stretched across two states so based upon our model we had to split their operation into our two separate charters with some of the assets going into new mexico and some of them going into texas jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yes no makes sense excited to kind of hear the results of that and maybe just bryan then i would the expense guide is maybe absent any decision on that to come in the fourth quarter is that fair to say or would that have much impact bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah and i would say the impact is likely to come more towards the end of when we get the charter consolidations done so i think its going to be a little bit of a lag before you start to see the impact on our run rate from the consolidation there probably will be some onetime expenses that well incur to get the consolidations done as we go through so could be a little lag before we see the benefit still working on the timing and what other things we have to make sure weve kind of cleared the deck of a couple of projects and then we can get going assuming we finalize the process here jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so your modest increase in the would be absent that and like you said maybe some upfront costs and the savings that you potentially identified would kind of be a event is that fair bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah late i would say yeah late into yes jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay maybe one last one on expenses it just seems a little elevated i know the projects that youve and appreciate the slide on the number of items that youre working on was there any lumpy pull forward in this quarter that would suggest that tracking these projects is a little difficult from quartertoquarter but was this on a higher side given your guidance it sounds like flat and then moderate next year but maybe just give us an update on the timeline of kind of where you are on that internal spend and work on that front bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yes i think a couple of things so we still have one quarter left in and i think the consulting part so what we ph expense as we do these projects well probably have one more quarter to go and then we expect that should start to slow down as we really then concentrate on the charter consolidation as one of our main projects so that should come down we do have a little bump up in temp costs again trying to get some of these projects to completion before we start the consolidation so i would say those are two things that happened on the project side professional fees and some of it was in the salaries and benefit line as well heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 the rest of the cost increase a lot of it was we added the landing teams that bruce talked about so that was one component and quite frankly we have been getting a benefit from our employees not doing as much in the healthcare area staying at home not visiting the doctor not doing some of their normal healthcare and so were seeing that starting to open up were seeing the claims starting to pick up and a lot of that is normal people going back and using the healthcare system so those new teams and the healthcare costs i think are going to stick and so thats why im thinking some of this cost to be a little bit stickier than other jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it sorry that triggered one last small one the agribusiness team you added in the central valley what was the total number of folks that you brought on bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and they bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc indiscernible jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co sound like it range go ahead bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc that would include again relationship managers treasury management officers and the credit team and support team jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great thank you ill step back operator thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks jeff operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc terry are you there towanda i dont think its coming through operator check see if your line is on mute terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc is that better bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc there we go bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc indiscernible terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc oops sorry i think battery in the headset died good afternoon everyone lets just stick with the just the consolidation of the bank charters i mean everything ive heard sounds quite positive what would you lose whats the other side of the argument that is maybe being discussed internally bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc well we spent a lot of time talking about it and we dont think theres really very much that we lose at all especially when you keep the brands you keep our structure with the local ceo local decisionmaking local boards quite honestly thats why we chose to do it we didnt see any downside terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc that makes complete sense slide the digital strategy so much went into that slide and i dont want to just overlook it so i guess my question is do a few things very well first whats the takeaway from the slide is it treasury management consumer loan originations or what are those few things that youre looking to do extremely well at least in phase here bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i think the way to think about it is if you look at the upper lefthand corner those are the things were really trying to do better and those are the things that the customers are asking for first so we really thought that we heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 would turn this around a little bit and not focus on what we thought the right thing to do was but what did the customers expectations what expectations do they have and so then also on the righthand upper righthand corner those are also things that our customers were looking for in sort of the bottom half a lot of this is more on what i would call the efficiency side bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think terry just to add on that i think what were really working hard is to get that ph acquire and fill that top one the account analysis that ph work of trying to get done before the end of the year the account opening and maintenance and the online products were trying to get those done before we start to collapse the charters so that is all ready so that as the charters move together that functionality just grows across the footprint bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i think the other thing terry and it goes to a little bit of the elevated expenses bryan already talked about as well is getting some things done first we wanted to get the customerfacing things done first to provide value for that customer experience so then next year we can really focus on this charter collapse and installing temenos for the on the retail side because we believe that will be a game changer for our customers and internally terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc we only indiscernible capacity so we wanted to get we have to get some of these things done first terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc understood i appreciate that and bryan thanks for your fourth quarter outlook for some of the balance sheet and income statement items very helpful thanks bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch with piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi good afternoon everyone just one last question on expenses the million in the modest growth next year that modest growth up that run rate not the full year number in is that correct heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i would say actually were trying to have it be very modest of this million because again as we go into next year i think some of the consulting and some of the things were doing will come off but again i think its modest over the full year probably relatively flat to hopefully slightly down from where we are andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it okay thats helpful bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc indiscernible and as i said the one headwind that concerns me is all the inflation thats out there and all the wage inflation things like that that we all in the industry are going to deal with so thats probably the biggest hurdle to get where we want to go right now andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co certainly yeah then on the securities portfolio continued to add some this quarter ph you dont have as much cash as you did a few quarters ago but whats the appetite to continue building that portfolio and what have you been adding there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah so i think in terms of growth of the portfolio our hope is that the growth will slow considerably and maybe flatten out as we can get this loan engine these new teams humming we like to be able to convert basically the cash flow a little bit off the investment portfolio and certainly the cash flow its coming off of the forgiveness right until back into loans so if we can do that you may not see earning assets grow a whole lot for a quarter or two just more reposition and then after that we should see earning assets grow as ppp forgiveness is over and then indiscernible bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah in terms of ph what were adding its probably what most banks are adding its fairly low credit ginnie maes those sorts of things i dont know probably in the ph to range in terms of yield right now hopefully getting a little bit better with the 10year moving up but we tend to play a little bit shorter of the 10year mark so it helps a little bit we really need the front end of the curve to come up for us to get the real benefit from our balance sheet andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co definitely and then the team that came over in the central valley california what size loan portfolio were they managing at their prior bank heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc prior to coming over it was in excess of billion andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay so bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and i want to make sure andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible bring that over but that seems a little thatd be aggressive indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc theres an opportunity there andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks for taking the questions ill step back operator thank you our next question comes from the line of damon delmonte with kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybody is doing well today bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc indiscernible damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just one quick followup on the great great one quick followup on that the lending team you guys brought over are you disclosing where they came from bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc we are not disclosing where they came from heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay fair enough and then they started was it like early in the quarter or i guess when did they come on board and what is the maybe is there like any restrictions on where they can try to bring over some of that business bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so they came late in the quarter so we really we didnt get any real production out of them in the third quarter and they do not have any restrictions so we do expect to get some volume from them from that team even in the fourth quarter damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay great and then obviously you guys have a lot going on the charter consolidation seems to be a pretty sizable project for you guys that youre working on how does all of this kind of internal behind the scenes activity is going on how does this impact your outlook for ma which has been a longstanding component of your strategy do you are you guys kind of shifting towards focusing more on what youve built and leveraging the current footprint and not relying on external growth anymore or how do we think about ma bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say that we want to do both this is the opportunity and we can control this and we felt it was time again on these projects as well as the charter consolidations but the way that we are thinking about it we can still do ma and charter consolidation and indiscernible and the talent acquisition strategies damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then just lastly bryan could you just go back and revisit your commentary on the margin outlook and the core margin and i may have missed what you said the impact was from ppp loans this quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah ppp loans had a bigger impact this quarter the dollar amount so looking at nonnetinterest income the dollar amount was the same but it had a bigger impact in terms of the basis points im thinking i did that hang on here go through my notes yeah i think had had we not had the ppp loans and you and if you backed out the purchase accounting our margin would have been around damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc so it had about basis points of effect this quarter heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay perfect and then that can you just repeat what you were saying about your expectation in the fourth quarter and kind of as you head into bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think in the fourth quarter i think with the so i think of it in two different ways i think the margin is going to continue to be under pressure a few basis points just because of still theres a lot of liquidity and there is the continued loan repricing of that in the investment portfolio but i think ph net interest income dollars will grow because we had a lot of growth come in at the end of the quarter both in the investment portfolio as well as in the loan portfolio and if we can were off to a decent start this quarter already on bruces million projections so if we can keep bringing that in and get that to average those three pieces should give us pickup in net interest income the real wild card will be ppp and how much of that gets forgiven and how much of that million we bring in this quarter versus moves into next year in the first quarter because probably i think that million or just under million million or whatever it is is going to come in i think almost all of its going to come in the next two quarters damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and i guess just lastly on credit a few quarters in a row of negative provisioning do you think that youre going to need to take any provisioning here to close out the year and as we go into bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i always hesitate to say yes or no because tomorrow nathan could call me and say something happened that we didnt expect i would say if nothing unexpected happens in terms of nonperformers popping up new non performers or some nonperformer ph giving way worse than we thought i think we should be again i think theres still going to be net loan upgrades rather than downgrades and i think that will largely offset the need to provide for a loan growth component so im thinking we could be plus or minus a little bit around zero damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay all right thats great thats all that i had thank you very much operator thank you we have a followup from the line of jeff rulis your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks indiscernible the line a little bit with organic ma sort of opportunities but just at a high level youve seen quite a few larger bank announcements throughout your footprint in terms of not moes but larger transactions care to kind of comment on opportunities off of that or if that again back to that ma discussion could you sit back and maybe take dislocation of other deals versus super aggressive on buying or just i guess heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2021 the reaction of your from your group on deals youve seen throughout your footprint if that changes anything or your thoughts on opportunity lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc yeah we continue jeff to have a deep pipeline of banks of all sizes know smaller deals are difficult because they just dont move the needle on eps but if theyre very strategic and in our current markets i mean we would look at deals that are under billion and as to larger deals i mean we prefer to do transactions from billion to call it billion or billion those are big enough to move the needle but again were focused on our current markets in building scale and dominance in those markets yeah the moes that youre talking about we wouldnt be opposed to them but as you know those are more challenging to put together they take longer theyre harder to do and you always have the social issues so again not opposed to it but we look at anything thats very positive for the shareholders obviously bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and jeff i might just a couple of followups there again our strategy right now is to control what we can control and we think thats first and foremost on the talent acquisition side because that will help us grow whether its in california or in the midwestern cities that i referenced also we have had a lot of good hires that weve made in colorado so were really focused on growing that first and as you mentioned we have a few of those particularly moes have occurred in
