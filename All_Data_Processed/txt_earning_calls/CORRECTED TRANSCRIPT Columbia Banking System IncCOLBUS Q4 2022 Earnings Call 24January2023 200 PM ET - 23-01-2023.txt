and they were successful in capitalizing on opportunities winning new business and providing the necessary capital to allow our customers to grow and expand we extend our footprint into utah and arizona during the year all the while nurturing our existing client base in an ph interest rate environment unseen in well over a decade that werent enough teams across the bank were simultaneously involved in integration efforts for our merger with umpqua and during the first quarter of we completed the core conversion for our bank of commerce columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 holdings acquisition notwithstanding these competing priorities our bankers delivered outstanding full year results annual net income exceeded million for the first time in our history full year eps expanded by to a new high volumes rose by during the year after adjusting for ppp runoff and our operating efficiency ratio fell below in the fourth quarter although it took longer than initially expected on january we announced we had received approval from the fdic clearing the last regulatory hurdle for our merger with umpqua im happy to report that we completed the first of the branchs divestiture sales this past weekend with the second scheduled in february consequently we expect the merger with umpqua to close february and we are still planning for the systems conversion in march its an understatement to say im proud to lead such a talented and committed team associates across the company have done an outstanding job over the past months remaining extremely focused on all of our stakeholders in addition to preparing for our merger with umpqua our bankers focused on sustaining and growing our normal business activities while simultaneously supporting integration efforts and conversion planning i want to thank them for their commitment for rising to the challenge as we work toward creating one of the premier banking franchises in the western us on the call with me today are aaron deer our chief financial officer and chris merrywell our chief operating officer following our prepared remarks we will be happy to answer your questions i need to remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release or website or sec filings at this point ill turn the call over to aaron aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc good morning everyone as clint noted full year net income of million and eps of were new annual record our performance was a reflection of strong loan growth and rising interest rates combined with solid fee income wellcontrolled spending and thoughtfully managed credit excluding costs related to be umpqua combination and merchants acquisition of million pretax preprovision income was a record million exceeding the prior record set in by million or fourth quarter earnings of million and eps of represented a linked quarter increase of million and respectively quarterly pretax preprovision earnings increased by million to million due to continued expansion of net interest income the core increase was actually larger but we had higher sequential merger costs and recall that we had a nonrecurring gain of million on a building sale in the third quarter the balance sheet funding mix shifted during the quarter and was supported by an increase of million in shortterm borrowings as deposits declined by billion to billion the overall mix of deposits remains firm and our liquidity position remains very strong providing us with continued deposit pricing flexibility the loantodeposit ratio at yearend was which remains at the low end of the fiveyear average preceding the pandemic total loans were essentially flat linked quarter after accounting for million of loans moved to held for sale in preparation for the divestiture and branches as a condition of the umpqua merger excluding this new loan production exceeding million was essentially offset by contractual prepayments rather contractual payments along with an uptick in early prepayments and seasonally lower line utilization early repayments were million in the fourth quarter versus million in the third as more borrowers are choosing to use their liquidity to pay down debt that is repriced to current market rate columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 the investment portfolio decreased million to billion as paydowns and maturities were partly offset by fair value movement related to the available forsale book the portfolio was split held to maturity and available for sale as of yearend the overall investment securities yield was essentially unchanged at while the duration decreased slightly to years our net interest margin continues to benefit from rising rate increasing basis points linked quarter to predominantly driven by higher average loan rate and a stronger earning asset mix partly offsetting this our cost of deposits rose relatively modest bps to basis points our overall cost of interestbearing liabilities rose basis points to basis points due mostly to higher fhlb borrowing though our exceptional deposit base continues to support a favorable overall cost of fund new loan coupons in the fourth quarter were at an average rate of which compares to in the fourth quarter of notably the vast majority of our loans moved above their floors in the latter half of noninterest income decreased million linked quarter to million after adjusting for the property sale gain i noted earlier however noninterest income increased by approximately mostly due to boli gains of we continue to see solid deposit account and treasury management fees with strengthened financial services and trust revenue offsetting lower loan revenue due to weakness in mortgage banking activity excluding mergerrelated expenses in the third and fourth quarter noninterest expense decreased million sequentially to million primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expense and we had good cost control across the board combined with our strong revenue operating efficiency dropped to for the quarter meanwhile the effective tax rate remained level at lastly credit metrics improved during the quarter reflecting continued industryleading asset quality nonperforming assets decreased slightly with npas at yearend representing just basis points of total asset and we recorded net recoveries of million despite these favorable trends we recorded a million provision reflecting a less optimistic economic forecast as a result the allowance as a percentage of total loans rose to at yearend compared to as of september and with that ill turn it over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone as aaron mentioned solid loan production of million was in line with previous fourth quarters and drove full year production to a new postppp record of billion accordingly loan growth was tempered by a normal seasonal reduction in line utilization loan balances grew to billion representing an increase of during the year and when adjusted for ppp paydowns production during the quarter was predominantly split between cre and cni overall line utilization down basis points during the quarter to but was up from a year ago cre remains welldiversified across multiple industries and is well balanced with income properties and owneroccupied were very proud of our bankers and our cni portfolio continues to reflect their disciplined relationshipbased approach our quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio now stands at fixed floating and variable ppp loans are no longer a measurable part of the portfolio at only million as of yearend the geographic distribution of our loan portfolio stands at washington oregon california idaho with the remaining in other states columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 deposits fell by billion during the quarter and the outflows were due to a variety of factors including normal seasonal activity and a reversion of excess client liquidity back towards historical levels clients use funds for a variety of purposes to include yearend bonuses and distributions paying down debt making investments and moving cash to higher paying alternatives including approximately million to cb financial services during the quarter and almost million during the full year with the majority of that coming in the second half of the year the deposit mix shifted slightly during the quarter with of our deposits ph towards for businesses and from consumers as of yearend and the ratio of noninterestbearing demand deposits improved from at the end of to at the end of on the fee income front our wealth management group had yet another record year with over million in revenue our retail commercial and wealth management teams continue to work together in an effort to bank the entire relationship across our clients lifecycles and with that ill turn the call back over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks chris our regular quarterly dividend of was announced this morning this quarters dividend will be paid on february to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now justin well open the call for qa columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from david feaster from raymond james your line is now open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning david christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc good morning david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc kind of like to follow up maybe on the deposit front and maybe you touched on some of the competitive dynamics there i was wondering if you could maybe help quantify maybe some of the surge deposit outflows versus seasonal dynamics and versus clients utilizing cash to pay down higher cost debt and then i guess from a competitive standpoint are you seeing certain geographies maybe more competitive than you think were through the surge deposits and just curious on some comments on that front aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc sure this is aaron ill start and let chris clean up for me but the we certainly have seen some revision of excess client funding kind of revert back toward normal level i think theres probably still a little bit more of that to be seen given some of the analysis weve done on that front but i think if you look overall through the pandemic we saw outsized inflows relative to a lot of our competitors even after the outflows that we saw this quarter we continue to run ahead of most of our peers and so were still feeling very good about the what the deposit flows have been and the mix and weve just continued and i think a lot of that just reflects our continued discipline in terms of pricing and i can let chris talk a little bit more about that christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc sure thing aaron david yeah you mentioned the part about is it more competitive in certain markets and i would tell you all markets are competitive and its different competitors in certain markets but youre seeing lots of deposit specials things of that nature im really happy with the team and how theyre working with our clients to find out what the purpose of the funds were trying not to become interest rate sensitive or rate sensitive when we dont have to and in utilizing the tools that are available through wealth management and such columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 but the reality is is there are some pretty significant specials that are out there weve used our exception pricing and the discipline around that to keep our costs from going up on that but there are some folks that have chosen to pivot into a treasury bill or cd special or money market special in another bank but were not seeing that were losing the relationships were just seeing a pivot for some put it more under the hot money category but were really comfortable with the relationships we still have with those client david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc if you look at the composition of noninterest bearing as a percentage of the total that continue to be very stable in fact it actually ticked up just a little bit sequentially and just in terms of the loan deposit ratio if you look back to where that stood as i mentioned in my opening comments over the five years preceding the pandemic it basically ranged between and and were still down at the very bottom end of that so we still have a lot of flexibility david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah absolutely and if you do see some more of those surge deposits outflow is fhlb advances the primary way of funding those versus securities sales or cds or anything like that aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah at this point that would be our preferred source of funding david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and maybe touching on the growth side and somewhat of a seasonal slowdown in originations just curious how much of that is your appetite for credit diminishing somewhat just given the economic backdrop versus demand for credit in the market slowing or competitive dynamics maybe even fewer attractive deals coming across the desk and just curious where what segments are still attractive to you and still coming bringing good riskadjusted returns at this point in the cycle clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well david as always you pack a lot into a question so feel free to circle back if we dont fully address each aspect of that i guess ill start off and then hand it over to chris so from an appetite standpoint were very comfortable with all the different verticals that weve historically been in were committed to remaining throughout the cycles to our clients and to our bankers within those verticals and then when we look at our pending merger with umpqua theres not any portfolio of concentration issues that get created as a result of that in fact it actually on a combined basis gives us more room to run within those verticals that we do have expertise in i think the key part of your question though is ill paraphrase can we quantify what we stepped away from because of either underwriting i dont really call i guess you could say its competitive dynamics i think i just call it people that are still very much focused on putting up loan growth numbers as opposed to really looking at where columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 we might be heading from an economy or economic standpoint and then realizing that all right the risk return isnt there and so from our perspective wed rather pass and protect shareholder value and let somebody else take that deal and there was quite a bit of that during the quarter and ill let chris give you the specifics christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks yeah david the dynamics during the quarter of what we were tracking as we saw rates coming in and what the requests were it approaches a couple hundred million in deals that we simply looked at and said it is not in the shareholders best interest to put that on the books and we were seeing rates that frankly were below the 10year treasury and it just doesnt seem prudent to put that type of business on at this time now if there was something that was a relationship or something like that as weve mentioned in the past we certainly will be flexible with that type of pricing but when you look at some of the new business that we would normally attract throughout the year thats where we chose to walk away from those types of deals david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc that makes sense and then last one maybe for me you guys talked about having the first mock conversion in a readiness review with upcoming systems conversion im just curious how that went and maybe what you learned from that and then as we think about this whole conversion process its kind of a unique opportunity from the integration management office standpoint theyve been looking at this for a long time is there anything while were going through these opportunities or other investments or upgrades as we go through the conversion and integration that maybe we can accelerate just curious from the conversion standpoint your thoughts around that aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc hey david this is aaron yeah the mock conversion went very well of course theres always some lessons learned and were figuring out ways we can make sure we do things better but were having a tremendous amount of client communication right now thats going out to make sure that when we do get to the actual conversion that it goes absolutely smoothly as possible and we want it to be a seamless experience for the customer and for our associates as possible so were spending a lot of time there indiscernible obviously is leading that effort and as weve gone through this weve had a principle of not introducing new risks to any of this process so we havent necessarily been actively looking to build in new products as part of this process but certainly were continuously looking at the competitive environment and speaking to our clients about what their needs are and making sure that we are staying ahead of that and anticipating that and so there are things that well be looking to do in the year ahead to make sure that all of our treasury management capabilities continue to be leading edge but theres nothing that were trying to implement through the integration process clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc the one thing ill add to that is weve spent a lot of time over the past months talking about the complementary nature of columbias business activities and umpquas business activities so we think that theres a lot of opportunity for upside with existing capabilities between the two organizations so for example our healthcare book leveraging impacts capabilities some of those types of things umpquas got a more sophisticated and columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 broader product set on the treasury management side that existing columbia customers will instantly get the benefit of those expanded offerings so i do think that theres plenty of opportunities already existing and then to aarons point try to minimize the number of moving parts to the extent we can at these critical moments of conversion and integration but with the conversion scheduled shortly after the close i think well be able to quickly pivot in the back half of the year towards looking at are there things that have emerged that neither bank has that we think long term would give us an advantage and so i think itll be a quick turn but i think were set up very very well they want to meet not only meet the needs but exceed the needs of most of our customers and continue to grow with them david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color thanks and were excited to see what has gotten in store for you all thanks operator and thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from jeff rulis from da davidson your line is now open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi good morning i just wanted to indiscernible in on the maybe if i could the core noninterest expense and fee income lines ive got it around ph in call it so one of the first to get those numbers aligned with what your thoughts are on core and then if you have any thoughts about how that transitions outside of seasonal influences but look at per kind of growth rates for the year thank you aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah jeff those are pretty close if you want i can give you the specifics behind the underlying merger cost in terms of what lines those had if thats helpful to you but i think i would echo the comments that ron made on the earlier umpqua call in terms of expectations for first quarter typically youre going to see an uptick in expenses related to indiscernible that sort of thing and then shortly after that you get the kind of annual merit increase impact but a lot of those seasonal costs hit in the first quarter then trail off through the year so i dont think youre going to see anything outsized or abnormal related to that of course with the exception of our two institutions coming together so jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co aaron expectation of growth in outside of the lets just exclude the cost saves but just standalone columbia are you in kind of a or kind of growth for aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah were probably i would say to is probably more in the range of what id be thinking jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 okay got you okay and then i guess similarly looking at growth loan growth that is and understood on some of the puts and takes competitively and within customer movement your own appetite also if you layer in i dont know if youve got visibility on payoffs or paydowns but kind of where your budget on a growth expectation for columbia standalone christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah jeff this is chris i think the visibility to it theres always payoffs paydowns theres normal amortization et cetera and i just put it into kind of normal course of business right now with the interest rate environment where it is your unforeseen payoffs are less likely you may still see some business sales or some things like that but were pretty comfortable where we are on it i would look at overall youre in a low to midsingle digits i dont know that i would go much over on that as far as the mid but youre in that space kind of with the market dynamics where theyre at and what were looking at but again our bankers are seeing lots of opportunities and its just a matter of which ones make the most sense to put onto the balance sheet but low to midsingle digits is i think a comfortable spot to be jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks chris ill step back operator and thank you operator instructions and our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi hello everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey jon aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey i dont know if youll answer this one but ill give it a shot on slide of your presentation the last bullet shows core expense run rate communicated and if you go back to your original deck you talked about million of full run rate savings with twothirds of it in how do you want us to think about the timing of the cost saves given that your systems conversion is going to occur at the same time than you originally planned clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i mean its a great question just given the passage of time with the protracted approval weve identified the million typically the timing of when those are realized is some immediately at close and then usually columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 theres another wave of those somewhere between days and days post systems conversion and integration so were shooting for a clean run rate for fourth quarter of so we would expect that all ph million is fully implemented sometime within the third quarter kind of how that flows between first quarter second quarter i dont have that in front of me i dont know if aaron does specifically what i will say is that weve had some of that has actually been realized just as some of the attrition that weve had from a employee standpoint were centered in positions that were not goforward and so theres a little bit of that thats already in the run rate id say i dont know if you want to add anything to that aaron aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no i just think i mean the thing thats changed is maybe the order of the timing of when various saves are realized but in terms of the end date of when we expect to hit a good run rate as clint said that expectation of hitting that by yearend remains jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats actually very helpful and what i was looking for and just a followup on the margin question actually its kind of impressive when you see your earning asset yields up like they were but your interest bearing liability cost were up about the same amount and thats outperformed most of the other banks that ive seen just philosophically when you think about those the direction of those two interestearning asset yields and interest rate and liability costs is there more pressure on the liability side at this point or do you feel like you can kind of keep pace with asset yield expansion that maybe matches or exceeded liability cost expansion aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc its a good question because the you are seeing an acceleration here through the year on the liability side but i think if you look at where the new asset yields are coming on and then continue to see a little bit of a mix shift as we utilize this cash flows coming off the investment securities portfolio i think we should see them at least be matched if were not seeing continued expansion overall between the two jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats helpful and then i guess one more followup you may have kind of answered it before chris or clint but any of the big picture themes that you laid out when the merger was announced have they changed at all in your mind positive or negative and in terms of the revenue synergies i know you dont really want to lay them out at this point but any other opportunities that youve found as youve kind of played this waiting game for approval thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so big picture the world is completely different than what it was when we announced this thing ph geez what months ago almost but in terms of what our expectations were and what we thought that we would achieve on a combined basis or be able to achieve on combined basis nothing has changed there in fact just with the passage of time probably more firmly entrenched in our beliefs that were going to be able to capture those revenue synergies columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 i think we did a fairly robust analysis of some of these things through the diligence process but then as you start to truly understand the depth of talent that umpqua bank has in some of these areas that would be additive to columbia standalone revenue streams its hard not to get excited waiting for march so we can hit the ground running so theres nothing that we expected that we now today are thinking that we wont be able to accomplish together ill step back and see if chris has anything he wants to add christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i think that fees around now having a firm date sticking with our conversion is gone honestly its what weve learned over all this time about the expanded capabilities and what our bankers are going to be able to take to market they now have that point in time where they know whats coming and then we can get right back out there and get to taking advantage of those capabilities so big picture i dont think things have changed but i think theres been a little bit more excitement created because of the length of time and only because we now have a finish line to it that it will be off and working on that aspect of it but yeah the world has changed rates are obviously different mortgage markets are different things of that nature but our bankers are still out there looking and prospecting and then now that with that finish line in sight i think its really exciting actually jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks good luck over the next five weeks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks just a question on credit obviously you guys have unbelievable credit numbers one of the conversations that taken a lot of our time as analyst recently is this office so i was hoping you could you speak to the kind of your thoughts on that portfolio it looks like its about maybe some characteristics the underwriting statistics anything youre particularly concerned about thatd be great thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well good morning chris ill start and well take maybe a team approach to answering your question here ill start by saying our metrics you saw on the release continue to remain pristine i think this is the first probably the first earnings call in 18plus years that andy mcdonald hasnt been on andys indiscernible some place in idaho right now so i think that in itself is a testament to how were thinking about credit specific to the office space columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 some of the a lot of the kind of urban core downtowntype office buildings thats not really its not really the type of things that we have in our portfolio and so i think theres a little bit of a significant difference between what youre seeing in lets say downtown seattle in portland and some of the other areas that were in from a occupancy standpoint but with that ill pass it over to chris and he can give you some more detail christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc sure chris what youve mentioned in our underwriting things of that nature it hasnt changed i mean weve always been fairly conservative by nature weve talked about that in the past whats changed is when you look at the portfolio and you stress test it towards higher rates were very comfortable with what were seeing there in the credit side and ph anything due thats coming on to stress for even higher rate so when you look at the ability of the borrower to withstand potentially if rates were to go up further values were to come down were working on lower to loan values overall certainly in the portfolio never been a max proceeds lender on anything new and again stressing the portfolio to those higher rates were not seeing anything and as clint mentioned were not really in the markets where youre seeing the headlines of businesses pulling out turning back office space and things of that nature thats really not our niche christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks for that aside from office i mean the wall of worry is high i guess broadly on the economy where else would you be spending more time just stress testing within your portfolio clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well actually everything thats stress test suggested not seeing any i mean theres not any really early warning signs that were seeing i think from conversations with andy theres an eye being kept on it when we do our provision with aaron and certainly looking at economic indicators and the unemployment and things of that nature but i guess you would say were keeping an eye on what may happen with some of these large companies and doing some downsizing and some layoffs but again when you hear some of those numbers these are companies that are not only across many states but theyre multinational and so it doesnt mean its all affecting an area right down the street from us but we are looking at those types of things havent seen anything thats popped up yet in any reviews or any of our testing christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc the other thing ill add is it really comes down to our bankers being proactive in managing their portfolios we talk a lot and a lot of banks probably do this talk about relationships but thats really the value of having a relationship is that theres ongoing twoway communication so that youre operating under the premise of no surprises and thats part of that is if we through that process has served us well for the years that weve been in business you find a borrower that maybe isnt as or provider isnt as indiscernible what you would think well then those are the types that wed prune out just on an ongoing basis and trying to make sure that we have the best clients possible or the best portfolio within each vertical possible that we can and so one area ill mention just specifically would be our indiscernible banking area thats something that as part of our ongoing management it was early that really started communicating with each of their columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 clients about whats your plan if rates go up what does it look like hows your inventory going to hold up whats your strategy for projects and as a result those portfolios are performing very well theres probably was a little bit of earning that occurred in late early as a result of those conversations but the vast majority of those relationships are intact and part of the great metrics that you see it also leads into other things that you see in the balance sheet now these are smaller portions of that dynamic but for example our builders are putting more of their own money into the projects so that lowers their deposit balances lowers their line utilization theres different things that kind of come into play that you can be at a macro level if you look at our financials christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks thank you for all the color operator and thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question is andrew terrell with stephens your line is now open andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning andrew a hi andrew andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc maybe just a start aaron on the fhlb borrowings this quarter were all the fhlbs added were they overnight funding or were there any term to the borrowings aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc its all very short term so a fair bit of overnight but its weeks not months or years andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah okay and then maybe just bigger picture if i think about the balance sheet on a pro forma basis throughout the year you will have marked the securities portfolio as the deal closed so thats reflected in pro forma capital do you feel like that gives you maybe philosophically just greater flexibility to roll or sell a greater portion of the bond book either to fund loan growth or maybe reduce the borrowing position throughout the year columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i mean ph once marked obviously that arguably gives you more flexibility that doesnt mean thats going to be the decision and obviously those cash flows on those parks come back and supports capital levels but i mean thats going to be a decision dependent upon what the rate environment is and what the balance sheet trends are going forward so and so im not going to presume just what thats going to be just yet clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc andrew the one thing ill add there and you were on the umpqua call just before this and i think ron ph fielded a similar question were not going to give our playbook out because theres a lot of folks besides just our investors that listen to this call or listen to the playback of it but it does present an opportunity for us to start thinking about just how we manage downside risk the falling rate over the intermediate term and ron and myself and the rest of the goforward executive team have started having those conversations and so were not going to say anything about what exactly the details are but we do have flexibility and i think more flexibility than most of the banks in our group will have to put some protection on the balance sheet for falling rates and thats a big part of that component of that strategy andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay very good i appreciate the color and the rest of mine were asked and addressed already so thanks clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andrew operator and thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from matthew clark from piper sandler your line is now open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning thanks for the questions first of all just on the your updated thoughts around your pro forma deposit beta through the cycle i think in the deck you guys show seemed to be your base case is that kind of what youre managing to as umpqua comes onboard and with only a couple more rate hikes allegedly from the fed aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no i mean its were i wouldnt say were managing to indiscernible per se obviously youve seen our deposit costs start to come up here in the last quarter of the year but the but its a date through the cycle our deposit beta on interest bearing is only basis points so overall its about half of that so thats going to continue to rise whether or not that exceeds what we saw in the last cycle is to be determined i think theres a decent expectation that its a bit higher than that just given the rate rising pace has been more aggressive and longer lasting so theres going to be more followthrough than what we saw during the last cycle columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2023 but what that ultimately is is going to depend on what we see in terms of just deposit flows loan demand and as clint kind of alluded to in the prior question about what we might do with the balance sheet overall matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yes okay and then if you had this spot rate on interestbearing deposits or total deposits at the end of the year and the average nim in the month of december aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i dont know if ive got the margin but the matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc deposits were basis points for interestbearing deposits matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay ill follow up with you on the monthly maybe just last one around ma i know you guys have a lot on your plate with the integration with umpqua but what are your general thoughts around additional kind of ma to the extent something comes available thats high quality in northern california clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well our highest priority is getting to february and getting our merger close and then assimilating the two companies and were both very experienced at that and i think the work that weve done we havent let the protracted closing process go to waste weve got a clearly defined combined culture weve put a few thousand of our associates from both companies through training on that so i think that the process of what ill say the systems piece thats all scheduled i think social aspect of integrating to large companies is well underway and has been for quite some time and so as we emerge from the back half or into the back half of approach the end of thats where well refine our combined strategy and strategic plan in terms of what we will be our primary focus over the next two to five years ma i envision will be a part of that the challenge frankly that well have is at 50plus billion and with the growth capabilities organic growth capabilities that we have today i mean if you look at what the two banks have done in the midst of all this uncertainty around them the closing would be the expansion in de novo markets the production that those teams have had theres i would say a short list of quality franchises that would meet our hurdle from an ma perspective but we have more work to do on that we have to get the work at hand done first and then well turn our focus to what targets
