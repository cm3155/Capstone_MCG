william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks very much john good morning everyone ill make some brief comments about our results the operating environment and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review fourth quarter results and some of our expectations for before we take your questions let me start with some highlights we earned billion or per common share in expenses declined from a year ago reflecting lower operating losses and progress on our efficiency initiatives revenue increased as we benefited from strong gains from equity securities and gain from sales of our student lending asset management and corporate trust businesses we also have broadbased revenue growth across our businesses including home lending consumer and small business banking credit card auto commercial real estate banking and wealth and investment management credit quality improved significantly as the economy improved and our customers had high levels of liquidity our loan chargeoff ratio declined from basis points in to basis points in and our allowance for credit losses declined by billion deposits increased billion or and loans grew with declines in the first half of the year offset by a increase in the second half we also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders including increasing our common stock dividend from per share to per share in the third quarter and we repurchased billion of common stock predominantly in the second half of the year after the return to the scb framework our results in the fourth quarter also showed continued broadbased momentum we earned billion or per common share we grew loans by billion or and deposits by billion or from the third quarter expenses declined from the third quarter and from a year ago and we generated positive operating leverage over both periods most importantly we continued to prioritize our risk and control work and the strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results consumers continue to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic though we do see this declining as the median balances today are higher than prepandemic levels but are down from the third quarter consumer credit card spend also continued to be strong up from the fourth quarter and up from the fourth quarter of holiday sales were strong with spending up the three weeks leading up to thanksgiving and that momentum continued postthanksgiving all spending categories were up in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago with the largest increases in travel fuel entertainment and dining weekly debit card spend during the fourth quarter was up every week compared to both and this increase was driven by higher transactions but also higher spend per transaction reflecting inflationary impacts and increased spending in higher cost categories such as travel we are watching the impact from omicron on consumer spending and while there is some softening in restaurant travel and entertainment in recent weeks overall spending remains strong in the first week of january with credit card up and debit card up versus the same week in and we saw strong loan growth from the third wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 quarter across our commercial businesses including commercial real estate assetbased lending middle market banking and our markets and banking businesses so ive been at the company for a little over two years now and i thought id spend a few minutes giving you my thoughts on our progress overall i feel great about what weve accomplished and continue to feel energized about the opportunities in front of us i think about this along several dimensions talent leadership and culture risk regulatory and control financial and strategic progress and our work on esg and broader reputational issues i have spoken of the substantial talent changes weve made but just to remind you of members are new to the operating committee and two are new to their job since i arrived additionally well over half of the senior most people at our company meaning those who are one level below the operating committee are new to their roles and a significant proportion of them were hired from outside the company this is a dramatic change in our leadership and with it weve changed how we run the company how we prioritize our work and how we view our responsibility broadly we began the process two years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company and the most significant part of this prioritization was the building and implementation of an effective risk and control framework across the company our approach and our progress are entirely different than they were when i arrived we are laser focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators we have clear plans in place and clear owners for every regulatory deliverable we have we have detailed reporting on how were progressing on those plans we review this reporting every single week at the operating committee level the detailed involvement of the operating committee members is very different from what was happening before i arrived our ability to identify issues has also improved from two years ago i continue to believe that were making significant progress and this is based on what we see in our internal reporting it doesnt mean that were perfect the fact that we have multiple consent orders makes it complex it takes time to build all of our capabilities and its certainly in the regulators purview to look at issues that have been outstanding for a long time like the occ did in the third quarter but i would point you to the comment made by the occ in their recent consent order that highlights that we have taken steps to comply with their order and were committed to addressing remaining requirements i remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years having said that it continues to be the case that were likely to have setbacks along the way but that doesnt change the fact that we believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done were making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have also begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses we are just now beginning to bring things to market that are differentiated and a number of significant opportunities are exciting were continuing to track to the financial return goals weve discussed first achieve a sustainable rotce subject to the same assumptions weve discussed in the past and then target we continue to believe that we will achieve a during one of the quarters in on an annualized basis to achieve this were aggressively focused on driving efficiencies and were seeing net expense reductions after significant investments in our control buildout and our businesses we are aggressively returning excess capital to shareholders now that weve returned to the scb framework we continue to manage credit well and were seeing early benefits from higher interest rates growing loan balances and higher fees in certain businesses wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 were doing this while devoting significant resources to building our franchise we have fallen behind in providing competitive digital capabilities for our clients this is changing in the fourth quarter we announced a rebuild mobile banking experience for consumer and small business customers that is set to begin rolling out this quarter it has a new modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs this platform is necessary to drive significantly higher digital adoption from our customers even with our existing capabilities in the fourth quarter our customers logged in billion times using a mobile device up yearoveryear tele transactions remained more than lower than prepandemic levels we also announced that later this year well be adding an allnew virtual assistant fargo to the app customers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions ask fargo to complete the task for them and fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their finances we will also be introducing the first phase of the redesign of our public website early this year in addition were beginning to become more active on the wholesale side for example we announced that were collaborating with hsbc to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchainbased solution which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs were also approaching payments and credit cards very differently we believe credit cards will remain important as both a credit and as a payment vehicle we are also doing additional working around noncard payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key financial services provider two years ago our products and capabilities supporting those products were not as competitive as necessary in we launched two products including active cash which we believe is the best cash back product in the marketplace and reflect which rewards customers for ontime payments we improved the core experience including investing in advertising simplifying our digital application and enhancing our underwriting these efforts have driven an increase in digital card activation paperless statements and enrollment alerts we are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were prelaunch of these products and importantly were not competing on credit in fact the quality of applications and the accounts were booking continues to be better than what we were booking historically away from card were beginning to invest in our broader digital payments across the platform enhancing our capabilities increasing limits and broadly reducing the friction in moving money as evidence zelle momentum continued to accelerate with zelle transactions up from a year ago we are also taking a very different approach in that we believe that for us to be successful we must consider a broader set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions this is not in lieu of shareholders in fact we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time we have taken significant efforts to support small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic and recently fulfilled our roughly million open for business fund commitment to assist small businesses in recovering from the pandemic by working with notforprofits to offer capital technical assistance and longterm programs the fund that was created by donating the gross processing fees we made from administering the paycheck protection program loans in additionally we made significant climate commitments in in the fourth quarter we joined the netzero banking alliance an industryled leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their financing with the goal of achieving netzero greenhouse gas emissions climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time and last year we announced our goal to achieve netzero wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 greenhouse gas emissions including emissions attributable to financing by we expect to announce our first financed emission targets for the oil and gas and power sectors later this year we made our first solarplus battery storage tax equity commitment once it is operational it will be one of the largest solar and battery projects in the company last year we surpassed billion in cumulative tax equity investments in nearly wind solar and fuel cell transactions these investments have provided of all utilityscale wind and solar capacity in the us over the past years we continue to be one of the top investors in affordable multifamily housing in the us as well as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments additionally were committed to expanding affordable homeownership for example in the fourth quarter we committed to invest million through the neighborhoodlift program to help more than low and moderate income residents in houston with home downpayment assistance weve also supported our employees and in december we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefits and competitive pay were increasing us minimum pay hourly pay levels to a range of to effective at the end of this month just this week we announced new efforts that will roll out over the course of to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover shortterm cash needs building on other changes weve made over the last several years the changes we announced include the elimination of transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection the elimination of nonsufficient fund fees early access to direct deposit by providing customer access to funds up to two days before their scheduled deposit a 24hour grace period for customers that overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee and a new shortterm credit product for customers to meet personal financial needs this builds on existing features we already have in place including clear access banking our nooverdraft checking account that we launched in september and we now have over million outstanding customer accounts overdraft rewind which was introduced in which automatically rewinds overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning which will be replaced by our expanded 24hour grace period balance alerts that help customers avoid overdrafts by sending more than million alerts every day putting all of these changes in perspective these fees are down significantly since the financial crisis we have alternatives for both customers that do not want to overdraft and those that do this is a competitive marketplace we continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customer and let me make a few comments now as we look forward while there is a risk with continued growth of the omicron variant or potentially other variants later this year i expect to see continued strong economic trends in consumers financial condition remains strong modest debt growth strong asset appreciation and higher deposit balances have left household balance sheets in excellent condition which should help drive continued strong consumer spending corporate america has demonstrated the ability to adapt to the everchanging pandemic conditions inventories remained unusually lean as businesses adopted a defensive posture and supply chains have been disrupted this is expected to result in substantial gains in industrial production as they continue to restock were beginning to see loan growth and expect this to continue in a moment mike will provide our thoughts on net interest income and expenses for i commented earlier that we remain on target to achieve a sustainable rotce subject to the same assumptions weve discussed in the past on a runrate basis at some point this year and that once weve achieved this goal well wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 discuss our plan to continue to increase returns but at a high level we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors including a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives a small impact from returns on growthrelated investments in our businesses continued execution on our risk and regulatory control framework and moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted its important to note we currently have the ability to grow loans even under the asset cap the changes weve made to the company and continued strong economic growth prospects make us feel good about how were positioned entering but we also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements with setbacks likely to continue along the way and we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us as we look forward we will continue to be aggressive in driving progress and improvement in our performance embrace our responsibility to our customers and communities and i remain incredibly optimistic about our future i want to conclude by thanking our employees who continue to serve our customers through another challenging year i appreciate their hard work and their resiliency while we made progress on making wells fargo better i look forward to all that we accomplish in the year ahead i will now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co great thanks charlie and good morning everyone charlie summarized how we helped our customers communities and employees last year on slides and so im going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on slide net income for the quarter was billion or per share common share our fourth quarter results included a million net gain on the sales of our corporate trust services business and wells fargo asset management there could be future gains related to these sales due to postclosing adjustments and earnout provisions an million decrease in allowance for credit losses as credit trends continue to be strong and a million sic million impairment of certain leased rail cars due to changes in demand for these cars we also had billion or billion after noncontrolling interest of equity gains primarily from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses the third consecutive quarter of strong returns in these businesses our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately including the discrete impacts related to business divestitures our cet1 ratio declined to in the fourth quarter reflecting share repurchases and an increase in risk weighted assets primarily from loan growth in the quarter we repurchased billion of common stock in the fourth quarter partially offset by billion of new issuances predominantly for the annual matching contribution for our 401k plans as a reminder the regulatory minimum for our cet1 ratio will be in the first quarter of reflecting a lower gsib capital surcharge turning to credit quality on slide our net chargeoff ratio was basis points in the fourth quarter commercial credit performance continue to be strong with net loan chargeoffs declining million from the third quarter to basis points despite the challenges created by the pandemic the commercial real estate portfolios continue to perform well commercial real estate valuations and investment activity has rebounded off their lows across all property types although there are still some risk in office and select hotel and retail segments wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 consumer credit performance also remained strong with higher collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remain above prepandemic levels consumer net chargeoffs of million increased million from the third quarter million of the increase is related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans nonperforming assets increased million or from the third quarter driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals primarily resulting from certain customers exiting covidrelated accommodation programs loans that were modified in upon exiting forbearance are reported as nonaccrual until they perform for a period of time overall early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have been in line with our expectations after increasing during the first four quarters of the pandemic commercial nonperforming assets have declined for four consecutive quarters and were back to prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter reflected continued strong credit performance the ongoing economic recovery and the uncertainties that still remain if the economic recovery continues we would expect to have additional reserve releases on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans grew from the third quarter with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios we had strong growth late in the quarter and periodend loans grew billion or from the third quarter with broadbased growth across most of our commercial and consumer portfolios ill highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results average deposits increased billion or from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking in corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap turning to net interest income on slide a year ago we provided our expectation for net interest income to be flat to down from the originally reported annualized fourth quarter level and we ended up being down for the full year fourth quarter net interest income was down million or from a year ago and grew million or from the third quarter the increase in the third quarter was driven by higher loan balances including higher interest income from loans purchased from securitization pools or epbos we also benefited from higher trading assets and a favorable funding mix in the fourth quarter we had million of interest income associated with epbos and at yearend we had a total of billion of these loans down from billion a year ago and as i highlighted last quarter we expect these balances to decline substantially by the end of this year we also had million of interest income in the fourth quarter from paycheck protection program loans or ppp loans and were outstanding and their outstanding declined to billion at year end weve reflected the headwind from these portfolios running off in our net interest income waterfall that i will review later on the call the net interest margin increased basis points from the third quarter basis points of which was due to higher interest income from epbos now turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago the decrease reflected progress we made on our efficiency initiatives including reductions in personnel costs consultant spend and wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 occupancy expense i will provide specific examples of the progress we made in our efficiency initiatives in later on the call before updating you on our expense expectations for we also had lower restructuring charges and operating losses in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago fourth quarter expenses included one month or approximately million of operating expenses from our corporate trust services business and wells fargo asset management prior to their sale on november now turning to our business segment starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago primarily due to higher depositrelated fees as fourth quarter of included some covidrelated fee waivers fourth quarter also reflected an increase in consumer activity including higher debit card transactions compared with a year ago and the benefit of strong deposit growth was largely offset by lower spreads charlie highlighted the enhancements and changes were making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees the impact from the fees that will be reduced including the elimination of nonsufficient fund or nsf fees as well as overdraft protection transfer fees is estimated to be approximately million annually also we expect that they may be partially offset by other fees due to higher levels of activity as well as the expiration of various feerelated waivers that were in place in in terms of new features to be rolled out in the latter part of the year including a 24hour grace period for overdrafts and a new shortterm loan product we will have to observe how customers respond home lending revenue declined from a year ago primarily due to lower mortgage banking income driven by lower gain on sale margins and origination volumes even before the recent rate back up we started to see a drop in application volume in december and we expect originations to decline in which will put pressure on margins as the industry adapt to the lower volume credit card revenue was up from a year ago driven by higher pointofsale volume partially offset by higher rewards cost including promotional offers on our new active cash card auto revenue increased from a year ago on higher loan balances with the average balances up billion turning to some key business drivers on slide our mortgage originations declined from the third quarter we expect our first quarter originations to continue to decline due to lower refinance activity and the typical seasonal slowdown in the purchase market we increased our nonconforming originations in the fourth quarter and have grown our nonconforming portfolio for seven consecutive months reflecting the improvements in our capabilities as well as the reintroduction of cash out refinancing late in the first quarter of turning to auto limited vehicle inventories continued to constrain industry new car sales however we had our third consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up from a year ago with the majority of our originations coming from used cars originations also benefited from the enhancements we continue to make in our capabilities importantly we are maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so turning to debit card transactions were relatively stable from the third quarter and up from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories credit card pointofsale purchase volume continued to be strong and was up from a year ago and from the third quarter while payment rates remain elevated balances grew from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products new credit card accounts more wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 than doubled from a year ago driven by our new active cash card and were pleased by the quality of the accounts weve been attracting turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago results included higher deposit balances and modestly higher investment banking fees partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments partially offset by lower loan balances noninterest expense declined from a year ago primarily driven by lower personnel and consulting expense due to the efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense loan balances started to increase late in the third quarter and now have grown for four consecutive months with growth accelerating in december as with other portfolios we are adhering to the same credit risk appetite increases in the middle market banking were driven by growth from our larger clients a modest uptick in revolver utilization and strong seasonal borrowing growth in assetbased lending and leasing was driven by new client wins as well as increased levels from higher prices and some increases in inventory levels turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago investment banking had a strong quarter with higher debt origination and advisory fees banking results also benefited from higher loan balances commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by higher loan balances and capital markets results on stronger commercial real estate financing activity loan originations returned to prepandemic levels and we had a healthy pipeline as we started the new year markets revenue was relatively stable from a year ago was down from the third quarter primarily due to lower trading activity in spread products and equity derivatives average deposits in corporate investment banking were down billion from a year ago driven by actions taken across all lines of business to manage under the asset cap average loans increased from both the third quarter and a year ago across all lines of business on a periodend basis loans grew every month since june and growth accelerated in december wealth and investment management on slide the revenue grew from a year ago as higher assetbased fees on market valuations more than offset a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates the increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenuerelated compensation which was more than offset by higher revenue this increase was partially offset by lower salaries expense reflecting progress on efficiency initiatives client assets reached a record trillion up from a year ago primarily driven by higher market valuations average deposits were up from a year ago and average loans increased from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securitiesbased lending slide highlights our corporate results revenue increased from a year ago driven by strong results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains on the sales of our corporate trust services business and wells fargo asset management these businesses contributed billion of revenue in excluding net gains on sale and billion of noninterest expense wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 we expect approximately million of these expenses associated with transition services agreements to remain in with offsetting revenue so its pl neutral we also expect approximately million of corporate overhead expenses related to these businesses to remain in which we expect to manage down over time turning now to our expectations for starting with net interest income on slide as the last couple weeks have demonstrated its challenging this early in the year to predict the rate environment loan demand and other variables that impact net interest income for the full year but let me highlight the key drivers of our net interest income for we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout moving left to right on the waterfall as weve discussed previously we have a headwind this year from the runoff of ppp and epbo loans however our current outlook for loans is for average balances to grow lowtomidsingle digits from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of along with other balance sheetmix changes this is expected to more than offset that headwind this net result would increase net interest income approximately in from the billion we generated in moving to rates and repricing the recent forward curve includes approximately three 25basispoint rate hikes this year beginning in may assuming this were to play out net interest income has the potential to grow up to an additional resulting in approximately in net interest income growth in versus that said the implied forward curve has changed a lot over the last month and a half so its very hard to forecast with any certainty another way to view our asset sensitivity is from the disclosure we provided in our third quarter 10q filing it showed that the estimated impact of an instantaneous basis points increase in shortterm rates would increase net interest income by approximately billion over the next months ultimately the amount of net interest income we earn in will depend on a variety of factors including the absolute level of interest rates the shape of the yield curve loan demand and cash redeployment now turning to expenses on slide we made progress last year on our efficiency initiatives and weve continued to identify new opportunities our portfolio of initiatives that includes realized and identified potential gross saves has grown from approximately billion to billion and we are continuing to work across the company we expect to execute on our remaining identified initiatives over the next two to three years and well continue to invest across our businesses importantly similar to last year we are excluding from our efficiency initiatives the resources needed to address our risk and control work and well continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work weve been reducing expenses across our businesses but let me highlight a few examples of the progress we made last year we eliminated management layers and increased span of control a decrease with managers with low span of control we completed approximately branch consolidations in a continuation of the progress weve made the last few years with branches down since weve also optimized branch staffing levels to better reflect our customers or how our customers are using our branches within our technology organization we reduced nonengineering roles by approximately driven by accelerated adoption of the agile framework and head count across the company declined approximately from a year ago excluding divested businesses wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 in addition to reducing the number of branches we also reduced our office real estate portfolio by approximately and occupancy expense was down compared with a year ago this year we expect to continue to realize savings from these initiatives and including an incremental reduction in office real estate additionally the investments were making in technology should drive improvements in operations consumer banking consumer lending and commercial banking importantly these efforts should not only reduce expenses but also improve the customer experience with enhanced fraud detection more service selfservice capabilities and faster underwriting decisions now turning to our expense outlook on slide following the waterfall from left to right we reported billion of noninterest expense in this was largely in line with our most recent guidance except for higher operating losses we had approximately million of expenses in related to business exits and restructuring charges and the civil money penalty associated with the occ enforcement action in september we also had approximately billion of expenses in from the wells fargo asset management and our corporate trust services business which were sold and that will not continue in so we believe a good starting point for the discussion of expenses is the billion we are assuming a modest increase in equity markets this year and expect revenuerelated expenses to grow by approximately million this includes expected increases in wealth and investment management and corporate and investment banking partially offset by expected declines in home lending reflecting lower origination volumes higher revenuerelated compensation is a good thing and the associated revenue will more than offset any increase in expenses we also expect approximately million of wage and benefitsrelated inflationary increases in above and beyond the normal level of merit and pay increases driven by higher personnel expenses including the minimum wage increase that charlie highlighted in other compensation changes through our efficiency initiatives we expect to realize approximately billion of gross expense reductions in this reduction is expected to be partially offset by approximately billion of incremental investments primarily related to higher personnel in expenses in commercial banking corporate and investment banking and technology as well as increased spending on risk management we also expect approximately million in increased spending in other areas including higher fdic insurance assessments higher travel and entertainment expenses which were significantly lower in due to the pandemic accordingly our fullyear expenses are expected to be approximately billion a net reduction of approximately million versus the billion embedded in our assumptions are approximately billion of operating losses for which is the amount we had in excluding the million associated with the occ enforcement action while weve made significant progress on working through legacy issues as we previously disclosed we still have outstanding litigation regulatory issues and related expenses could significantly exceed the levels we had in we made substantial progress last year on executing our efficiency initiatives but we still have significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company we are focused on achieving net expense reductions while appropriately investing in our businesses this remains a multiyear process with the ultimate goal of achieving an efficiency ratio in line with our peers and based on our business mix well now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question of the day will come from john mcdonald of autonomous research sir your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mike i was wondering if you could give us some sense of if the asset cap remains in place how much capacity do you have to grow loans obviously the ph ha data is picking up it feels like loan growths getting better for the industry i just want to make sure that youre invited to that party and you guys can grow loans while staying under the asset cap michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah hey john thanks for the question so just as you know and i think its implicit in what you asked but the constraint for us on the asset cap is really on the deposit side and so thats the part where were actively taking action to make sure weve got the room we need to particularly for our retail clients and were continuing to do that on the loan side we still have were not constrained on growth on the loan side so we still have plenty of room to continue to grow with our clients john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and could you give us some sense in your nii outlook what kind of loan growth are you building in and also liquidity deployment assumptions and how youre thinking about liquidity deployment given where the curve is here michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah sure embedded on slide weve assumed that kind of lowtomidsingledigit growth when you compare fourth quarter to fourth quarter and so hopefully were optimistic that well be able to get there and maybe theres certainly some scenarios where it could be it could grow faster than that but thats the assumption that we used there embedded in that column too on the chart in the loan growth and other balance sheet stuff is some modest redeployment into the securities portfolio id say modest so sort of single low kind of midtolowsingle digit sort of increases in the securities portfolio as well and so those are the assumptions embedded there and i think as we look at where the curve is today were still being overall pretty prudent and patient but we are in a very kind of small way beginning to buy some securities in the portfolio john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it thanks mike operator thank you the next question will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys mike you had mentioned that well you did a little bit better last year billion of gross saves versus what you originally thought at billion and you just commented that you still have a good line of sight as far as efficiency initiatives can you help us understand mike billion for this year how youre feeling about that but more importantly that line of sight how far out do you have that and do you continue to see an ability to take out this type of cost as you go forward even past this year thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no and ken what were really trying to do is make sure we embed this in the dna of how we operate the place and so thats ultimately whats going to be really important for us over the long run and i think youre seeing that the portfolio grew from billion to billion in terms of the initiatives that weve either executed on or about or in the process of executing and so i think youre seeing sort of that progress and growth there so you can sort of do the math of what weve accomplished so far what weve identified for this year and whats left for next year and i continue to believe that weve got more to do that we havent sort of built into that portfolio yet and so the teams continues to work on that every day as you look at our confidence level on the billion that we put into the forecast we feel good weve got really good line of sight and i think given what the team was able to do last year we have confidence that well be able to execute on that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey ken indiscernible let me just add to something that mike said which is im always im a firm believer on these efficiency initiatives especially in a company like this even if you go back over a decade one of the strengths of this company was never efficiency it was far more on the revenue side and so as we get the efficiencies that were starting to see it is like peeling the onion back where then the next set of opportunities become even clearer and so were ginning up the same process that we did at the beginning of this venture where we came up with the initial billion to go back and say okay now whats next in a very methodical way across the company so we feel i feel really good about whats in our numbers for next year and were going to continue to pursue this and i think its just as like just as youve seen in our numbers it gives us the ability to spend our investments and to become more efficient overall as a company so i personally dont feel like were close to done ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and if i can just ask the other side of that question too which is that youre doing a little less in the incremental investments versus what you did last year how do you get comfortable that youre doing enough especially what were hearing from the industry pressures not just inflation but just on the need to continue to and you mentioned this charlie about all the new things youre rolling out but how do you land on that number and how do you get the confidence that its the right amount that youre reinvesting wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah its a good question i think we do i think what most good companies do which is they sit around tables and they ask everyone to come back with what you want to spend money on and then figure out what you can actually do i think weve accomplished a tremendous amount on the technology side since saul van beurden who runs technology for us was brought in and i think were going to try and spend as much as we physically can get done but i think were always asking the question of whats next but i think the different position that were in versus others is were still in the ramping up stage which i also look at as opportunity because we have moved slower historically investing in some of these areas and to the extent that we find more efficiency money it gives us the opportunity to spend more broadly but i do feel that i think we as a company we as a management team do feel good about what were investing next year relative to where we stand as a company ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks a lot guys operator thank you the next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had two questions one was on the overdraft fees that you mentioned i think you said that it was like a million impact but we look at the regulatory filings and the regulatory filings show a higher level of overdraft fee run rate like in the billion kind of range so im just trying to understand what why it would be only million charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well first of all i mean were not eliminating overdraft fees were making a series of changes that we think make sense for the consumer we have an account that doesnt allow overdraft but we have an account that does allow overdraft and so we think its got its more consumerfriendly than it was in the past but we do continue to believe that there are a substantial number of customers out there that want us to pay overdraft on their behalf after theyve worked through a bunch of the buffers and benefits were giving them and theyre willing to pay for that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay so the nsf fees will be eliminated but youll have a different product that comes in charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well no its the same nsf fees will be eliminated entirely our overdraft fee will stay but weve added a series of things such as well give you availability on direct deposits two days in advance well give you an additional hours after you otherwise would have been charged for an overdraft to cure it so our overdraft fees will go down but were still going to be providing the overdraft product and well still be charging for it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right so my bad because i thought overdraft and nsf were pretty similar but thats not right so i get it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co no yeah think of that betsy think of the nsf fees as when you dont pay something into overdraft like a check and you return it then historically you would have charged a fee for that returned item thats an nsf fee the overdraft fees come into play when you actually pay something in overdraft betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah yeah i got it okay so i was using too much shorthand and thats my bad all right and then the second question is on the loan growth that you were talking about earlier in the prepared remarks and with john libor is no longer able to be used as a reference rate for ci or cre or any loan or any product right starting jan how does that impact you is that could that be a benefit to your loan growth in ci and cre and how are you thinking about shifting the reference rate that youre going to be using with your clients michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well i mean weve started that shift already as you would imagine right and we started we stopped offering new effectively stopped offering new liborbased loan products at some point in the fourth quarter weve probably done in the wholesale side maybe including wins so take out the consumer mortgage business weve done something like or just under that new facilities based on sofr with the large majority and obviously theres different ways to calculate so for a large majority of those were using sort of a daily simple rate so as sofr moves obviously that will adjust and so i think were seeing clients start to get used to it and start to use it complementing what were doing on the wholesale side is weve got weve stopped offering liborbased arms last year and so weve got tens of thousands couple tens of thousands at this point in terms of arms on the books using sofr there as well and so i think its starting to take hold betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 yeah i was just thinking like the capital markets might not be deep enough yet to be competitive against sofr or bsby product at least for the first half of this year so could that give you a little advantage here in originating michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co i dont see that having a huge impact on loan growth but betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co maybe well be surprised a little bit but i dont see that happening betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right because i didnt think the clo bid was there yet for sofr michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah like i said i dont see that happening i think there are starting to be some clos in sofr but like i dont see that happen being a big driver betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator the next question comes from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs hi good morning mike my first question is for you could you give us a sense of what deposit growth or runoff assumption you have in your nii simulation and similarly what kind of deposit repricing you presume michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah thanks erika look as you can guess were in a bit of a different spot than others right given our asset cap and so were already constrained on deposits and so were pushing away deposits every week now and so i dont expect in this year to have much of a runoff in deposits and if we start to see deposit levels going down well stop pushing others off and so i dont see that going to be a big driver for as you think about betas or and deposit pricing assumptions its largely similar to what we saw the last rate cycle but i would say that over the last three four five years our deposit base has changed quite a bit if you look at just based on the segments we are in as a shorthand where of our deposits are in our consumer wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 and small business banking business today if you go back a number of years that was probably closer to or and so the remixing of sort of our deposits as a result of some of the actions weve had to take will kind of lower the overall beta for the first number of rate hikes but i think it will look pretty similar to what we saw and as you can imagine since were constrained on growing deposits were not going to be the leader on pricing likely as we go over the next number of quarters erika najarian q analyst ubs and just to clarify so the betas in the last cycle if i remember were driven by a handful of cib deposits right and clearly that has been pushed out given assets some of that has been pushed given asset cap restrictions so embedded in this nii number is the experience of the last cycle that included the betas contributed by those deposits whereas as we actually look out today you have a much better and less ratesensitive deposit base michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co for sure and the betas might be similar on the cib deposits we just have less of them as a percentage erika najarian q analyst ubs right michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co of the overall book which lowers our overall beta charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co its just the mix michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah so erika najarian q analyst ubs right michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co but well see and a lot of that will be driven by what we see in the competitive environment right so particularly on those wholesale deposits but it will have a smaller impact on us than it did in the past just given the mix wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs understood and my last question is for charlie i think your investors are receiving very warmly what you and mike have said about youre trying to change how this bank is thinking by constantly identifying cost saves to fund future investments and as we look out in what looks like a more favorable rate backdrop and revenue backdrop from a growth perspective for banks do you see yourself reinvesting more of the identified savings as we enter a more favorable revenue backdrop charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i dont think i guess the way id put it is we dont think about it relative to what the rate scenario is or how much were making in nii i think again just think about where we are in the stage of our evolution which is were limiting our investments based upon just what can physically be done not based upon how much we actually want to spend i mean there are always a couple of small places around the place where people want to spend and you do have to prioritize i think a lot of the answer to your question will have to do as we continue to do our work strategically to determine where we want to create additional capabilities across the company we would expect the investment number to grow for sure but also as you know were spending a lot of money on infrastructure and im not talking about the risk buildout im just talking about the basic infrastructure of the company so i think as we sit here today we still think that we have an opportunity to both become much more efficient and to continue to grow the level of investments that are going to drive business results inside the company and thatll thats i would say is focused upon where we think we need to get to relative to how much money we should be spending as a company as opposed to any upside that we have because of just the change in rates at this point erika najarian q analyst ubs got it thats clear thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and another reason i would add is i just think for us that just it takes the pressure off of us to think that if we were to think that way if we were to say okay because of nothing weve done rates have gone up wed then start spending a lot more money were still in this as i said earlier were still in this phase of challenging ourselves to become as efficient as we should be and that having that pressure across the company at this stage for us is still a good thing just as were it is to challenge people to come up with where we should be investing erika najarian q analyst ubs thanks charlie operator the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so wanted to ask about the asset cap and can you just remind us like where you are in the process from your perspective have you implemented everything that youve submitted in your proposal and its just a matter of consistently executing on those changes or are there still call it material changes that youre making to address those issues charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co matt i understand youre very consistent in wanting to know the answer and i certainly appreciate that we have across all of this regulatory work we still have a substantial amount to do its really not right for me to talk about under any specific consent order where we think we are in the process because again what i said ultimately is whats going to matter is whether our regulators believe its done to their satisfaction and its really unhealthy to get into the game of do we think were done do we think theyre making the right conclusions i think its on us to continue to do all thats necessary and when theyre comfortable that weve satisfied those obligations they will make that determination and so i just again im sorry i understand why you seek more detail but its just a difficult thing and probably not the right thing for us to get to that level of specificity matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i appreciate that and i know i ask this line of question kind of every quarter but obviously its such a key part for the stock and i know ive also asked this kind of followup question i think you have like a slew of local regulators onsite or at least onsite virtually but i think theres a perception that its kind of more of the central regulators that are kind of going to be the ones that make the call and just remind us in general what is like the frequency of the dialogue with some more of those central regulators and just any flavor you can add on the communication there thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think its fair that i think i would speak for most big banks that the level of dialogue with both local staff and with dc is substantial and meaningful i know i can just tell you even from my last role its the right thing to do again we certainly have increased i think the level of dialogue that we have since the new team has gotten here and its hard to put specific how often we do it but its very very regular and i think its true that all of the big banks both the local staff as well as the staff in dc are both extremely important in their monitoring and in the way they draw conclusions about the company and we work hard to treat both extremely respectfully theres a very direct and open communication on their side as far as i can tell and as i said we say the same to the local people as we do to the dc staff but again theyre a very very important part of the journey that were on and we want them to be as knowledgeable about whats going on here on all of these important issues and were always available and willing to have those conversations with them matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question comes from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the questions mike i wanted to ask in a little bit more detail about rate positioning i think i can figure this out mostly from your guide and disclosures but would still be curious to hear your thoughts just with your significant asset sensitivity can you talk a little bit about sort of where youre most sensitive on the curve and sort of when and how you benefit like put simply is the first hike the same benefit as the third and so on or where or when is it more or less powerful michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and to state the obvious probably the short end of the curve is most meaningful right so when you look at just the whole curve shifting up something like twothirds of the benefit ends up being on the short end and so thats going to be by far the most meaningful piece of it i think for the first number of rate rises its hard to say exactly how many i think the first three or four though its pretty linear and you can use our disclosures as a way to sort of model that you get it earlier in the year you get it in march its worth a quarter more than if you get it in june and so forth and so its a pretty good guide at this point to use it that way r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then just separately one of the criticisms on the story over the past few years is there are a number of competitors a lot of smaller banks out there that sort of suggest that its still pretty easy to steal talent and business from wells fargo your emerging loan growth seems to be running kind of contrary to what has been that argument for the last couple years can you just sort of touch on that criticism and sort of where you are in terms of comfort with sort of stability and growth of the workforce charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i feel great about the people that we have here and ive listened to that for quite a while since ive been here and when i ask people for specifics very little seems to come back listen its a very very competitive workplace we lose people to competition we hire people from competition of all sizes i think i would say as i said before when you look at the team that we have in place both at a senior level all the way down to people that we cover customers i feel great about it and i can honestly tell you weve im trying to remember mike keep me honest here have we sat around a room and talked about gee oh my god look at all the people that were losing to these smaller competitors and what were going to do about it that conversation hasnt happened and were very knowledgeable about attrition thats happening at the company so if a small company hires a banker it might be a big deal for them were lucky enough to have a very broad set of coverage officers but thats not to say its not competitive so maybe theyre right but we feel good about the people that are here and were going to work hard to keep the people that are here michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and i would just add a little color weve been happy at what weve been able to recruit in places like the investment bank weve hired almost a few probably two to three dozen sort of relatively senior investment bankers weve hired a bunch of key people in the commercial bank on the front line and so i think as charlie said its definitely competitive and you could always find an anecdotal story of where somebody left to go do a wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 bigger job at a smaller place or so forth but we feel i think the teams feel good about being able attract good people into the roles and so obviously weve got to be competitive on pay but i think people are attracted to the franchise and attracted to the sort of direction and so far its been constructive there charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and i just want to say one other thing which is especially when you get down into places like the commercial bank and our different businesses that cover consumers as weve talked about having to improve the talent in some parts of the company the talent that we have in those areas is really exceptional and its really deep and its a huge strength of the company its been a strength of the company for a very long time so again i think that might tell you just how we think about the people that we have and again we never want to lose good people but it happens but its not something that we worry about hurting the franchise at this point r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good okay perfect i very much appreciate those thoughts so thanks again charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the lowsingledigit to midsingledigit loan growth assumption can you give us a little more detail on how that breaks out among the products out there core ci versus commercial real estate and consumer and then separately are there any areas of the loan book that youre really emphasizing at this point or see an opportunity to ramp your activity similar to what youve been doing on the credit card side thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look its a little bit of growth really across the board john and i think were seeing opportunity really everywhere and if you look at on the card side we are expecting to see some growth in the card side some of that will be like true revolve balances some of that will be some of the intro balances coming off the new products which will start to really pay off at the end of next year into the year after weve been really happy with what weve seen in the auto space which in this environment are pretty good assets pretty shortlived assets and high quality in terms of what weve seen there so we see some continued opportunity to grow there and then on the consumer side you have to go a little bit im sorry on the mortgage side you have to go a little bit below the covers and if you look at the nonconforming space we are seeing some growth there which we think will continue as we go into the year thats offset by these epbo loans going away but nonetheless we see some growth there so its really and the like i gave some color on the commercial banking stuff in my comments and we do expect some more opportunity in the multifamily and apartments and asset classes like that in commercial real wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 estate so in places like commercial real estate were being really targeted about it and even where you see a little limited growth in places like office in the quarter and even in places like that cash to equity ratios are up structures are better spreads are better given sort of what weve the way were managing that so were being really cautious in that space but i do think it will be a little bit of growth across the board if were successful john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thats helpful and then separately on the buyback front buyback came in a little bit better than we had expected in the fourth quarter maybe you can just give us your thoughts on the outlook there on your appetite buybacks and also how youre thinking about the dividend here in terms of deployment thanks michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look i think weve talked about this before and were maybe in a different spot than others just given some of the constraints we have on the asset cap but we still feel like weve got excess capital you can see that in the numbers yourself we do expect that well continue to see some loan growth so that will drive some rwa and so that weve got to be thoughtful about that and so as we laid out earlier last year we said we would do at least billion of buybacks through the four quarter period ending in the second quarter that still is achievable and we potentially have the opportunity to go above that if we decide thats the right path either this quarter or next quarter so well look at sort of how we feel with all the things we got to think about and make that decision as you sort of think about the dividend and i think charlie covered this a couple times last year is you think about a payout ratio that we hope to get to on a normalized basis so take out some of the onetime things that you see in the results its really kind of a to payout ratio is what we target over time and that just takes some time to get there and so i think well ultimately thats the board decision in terms of when and how much we increase the dividend but were still marching down that path but it takes some time to get there john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks mike appreciate it operator the next question comes from david long of raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone youve talked in the past about the operating expense savings being a multiyear plan and or initiative and so with your guidance this year in the billion range should we be expecting operating expenses to still be below that level michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look at this point as we think about it our goal would be to see a net reduction next year i think well obviously give you more guidance on how thats progressing as we get towards the end of the year and that will be a function of what we think we can invest properly and what inflation looks like and a whole bunch of factors wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 but were certainly given what our view on the efficiency side is targeting that but well give you more guidance on that later in the year i dont know if you have anything to add david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then as a followup a little bit longer down the road once the consent orders are mostly in the past if you replace the cost today to improve and upgrade your internal operations with the expected cost to sort of just maintain proper controls and risk management efforts how much savings do you see there michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look i think there is some savings there but our focus now is getting the work done and getting all the stuff in place and making sure its operating properly and so were focused a little bit were being thoughtful about how we implement that stuff but our focus is a little bit less on making it the most efficient and optimized process so we will get there when that stuff is all done and running for a while but thats a few years off i think in terms of really optimizing the risk and compliance indiscernible david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks mike appreciate it michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah operator the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i just wanted to squeeze one more question in here just on the fee outlook a fair amount of noise in the fee line this quarter i know you didnt give an explicit fee guide for but as we reflect the impact of business sales the overdraft change some weaker mortgage banking and normalization in equity gains how should we be thinking about the right jumping off point for fee income just looking ahead to next quarter in just more broadly michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co well i think you just outlined it to be honest i think you just have to take each of the lines right and i know weve talked about this on calls before like if you look at one of the biggest fee lines you take the investment advisory and other assetbased fees thats a function of our client assets and what the equity market is doing primarily and so thats probably something that you can model and weve got that grew a bit as we went through the year last year and then i think as you said were in the mortgage space well see some the fourth quarter number in the consumer side is probably a good place to start your jumping off point in modeling and as i think others have spoken about too is we all expect the mortgage market to be down with refinancings really driving that and how wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 well we do will be a function of how well were able to sort of penetrate on the purchase side so hopefully were down a little less than what the market is but that will be a function of what we can deliver and so i think you just got to take each of those lines and sort of model it forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks mike and maybe ill squeeze one more in if i can just on the earlier discussion around excess liquidity deployment it looked like you deployed some of that excess in the quarter and yet if i look relative to pre pandemic levels youve still seen a doubling of excess reserves and those deposits that you guys have on balance sheet as you noted earlier should be stickier as the fed initiates qt just given some of the changes in deposit mix i was hoping you could just size the amount of excess liquidity available for deployment today and if the long end continues to grind higher is there any appetite or willingness to deploy more aggressively than that midsingledigit growth thats contemplated in the nii walk michael p santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah i mean the first thing well be looking at is how fast loans are growing right so obviously thats the place youd want to see that liquidity get deployed first to support customers and so that will be a function of what we think is going to happen over a series of quarters and i think when you look at the securities portfolio we have done a lot in the last year both in increasing our mortgage exposure increasing our structured product clo exposure the place that you saw the decline was really in the treasury side and so given sort of what was happening in the rate environment and so i think you will see us start deploying more and as i mentioned earlier weve started in a very small way already given sort of what weve seen over the last couple weeks and i think really how much how fast we go or how much we go will be both a function of what we think is going to happen with rates but also how fast we think loans will grow and so those two things i think will drive sort of the pace and at this point embedded in our outlook or considerations there we do expect a modest increase in the portfolio and so well see how but well make that determination based on all the factors there that i mentioned steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color mike thanks so much for taking my questions operator the final question for today will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning guys charlie you talked about joining the netzero alliance as with some of your peers can you frame out for us as you guys get deeper into that and your peers do as well how should we try to estimate what types of risks you might be coming up against and how do you guys monitor those risks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 listen i think its a great question i think its the question that everyone is asking and i think the whole point about joining these alliances is to ensure that were all benefiting from each others experiences and those that have experienced this in other parts of the world to understand how to actually think about that what were doing is were going through how we think the impact of climate on a much longer term basis can impact all of the different businesses from a risk perspective but also understanding where the opportunities for us are and so whenever we talk about where were going on climate with our goal to get to net zero i think people too often jump to that means were going to stop doing things first of all what were trying to do is to assure that were doing everything we can to help all of our clients transition and that doesnt mean walking away from clients it means helping them invest in areas whether it is and we can do that in lots of different ways across the company with our own balance sheet or the public markets to invest in very very different ways and i think what youll start to see from us and others is a lot more disclosure on what the embedded risks are but also all the different things that were doing to play our part in reducing emissions more broadly so i just think its a question that i think we should continue to ask as we all continue to provide more significant disclosures than weve all done in the past on the topic gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i appreciate that thank you and pivoting to the followup question on credit obviously your guys credit is fantastic like the industry considering what we just came through can you give us some color on the reserve i assume as we normalize credit you and your peers how should we be looking at the reserve building over the next in going into the loan loss reserve building that is charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well let me start mike and then you just pick up i think the one thing obviously i think you guys all know this is not everyone starts at the same position when you look across what people have done with reserving across the industry i think we feel very good about where we are relative to what were seeing we all have to make determinations remember on a forward looking basis as to what the embedded losses are and i think everyone has a got a different point of view on that on the way that looks and i think were at the were doing the right thing but i still think its our assumptions are appropriate and conservative and beyond that remember the idea of looking forward in terms of whats going to change in addition to just loan growth and making sure that we provide for growth in the balance sheet its going to depend on the ultimate outcome of the performance of the economy and so as we sit here today we feel very very good about it but it can take lots of different turns and hopefully were still insulated from some level of downturn from where we sit today given the assumptions that weve made because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment so im not worried about where we are in personally but i think as we look beyond that its a living breathing calculation gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 14jan2022 listen thank you very much everyone for the time and we appreciate it and we will talk to you over the next quarter take care byebye
