don and good morning everyone as we noted in this mornings press release the favorable results we reported for the quarter highlight the strength and diversity of mts business model in the current challenging environment revenue in our fee generating businesses was particularly strong including mortgage banking trust and brokerage and payments credit trends are stable to improving illustrated by net chargeoffs about half our long term average a modest reserve release and little change in the level of nonaccrual loans in alignment with the strong revenue trends and the improved profitability over the last year incentive compensation is rising as well well offer some details on that in a moment lastly our capital levels continue to rise the cet1 ratio is near a record high as we await the closing of the peoples united merger now lets review our results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the third quarter of improved from in the second quarter of and in the third quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis mts third quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little change from the prior quarter also included in the quarters results were mergerrelated charges of million related to mts proposed acquisition of peoples united financial this amounted to million aftertax or per common share results for this years second quarter included million of such charges amounting to million aftertax effect or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions mts net operating income for the third quarter which excludes intangible amortization and the mergerrelated expenses was million compare that with million in the linked quarter and million in last years third quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter improved from in 2021s second quarter and up from in the third quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 the comparable returns were and in the second quarter of in accordance with the secs guidelines this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity lets take a look at some of the details that drove our results taxable equivalent net interest income was million in the third quarter of compared with million in the linked quarter higher income from ppp loans accounted for the majority of the million quarteroverquarter increase in net interest income and then the second round of ppp loans began to receive forgiveness from the small business administration the net interest margin for the past quarter was down just basis points from in the linked quarter we estimate that the higher balance of cash on deposit at federal reserve contributed about basis points of pressure to the margin largely offsetting that was the higher income from ppp loans both scheduled amortization and accelerated recognition of fees from forgiven loans which added an estimated basis points to the margin all other factors including lower income from hedges a slightly lower cost of deposits and an additional accrual day netted to zero impact compared with the second quarter of average interest earning assets increased by reflecting a increase in money market placements primarily cash on deposit with the fed and a decline in investment securities average loans outstanding declined about compared with the previous quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter overall commercial and industrial loans declined by billion or the primary driver was a billion decline in ppp loans dealer floor plan loans declined by million reflecting the ongoing impact from vehicle production and inventory issues seen across the industry all other ci loans were essentially little changed from the prior quarter commercial real estate loans were also little changed from the second quarter residential real estate loans declined by just under there are a few moving parts underlying that figure that are worth highlighting balance decreases due to normal prepayments and principal amortization including the hudson city portfolio drove some of the decrease as well as repooling of loans previously purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools those were offset by retention of new home production which will be a bigger factor in the fourth quarter consumer loans were up consistent with the recent quarters and continuing to be led by growth in indirect auto and recreational finance loans on an endofperiod basis total loans were down reflecting most of the same factors i just mentioned the decline in ci loans include a decline of ppp loans outstanding to billion at september average core customer deposits which exclude cds over increased or billion compared with the second quarter that figure includes billion of noninterestbearing deposits partially offset by lower interest checking deposits turning to noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter compared with million in the linked quarter the recent quarter included an insignificant valuation gain on equity securities largely on our remaining holdings of gse preferred stock while the prior quarter included million of valuation losses mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter revenues for our residential mortgage business including both origination and servicing activities were million in the third quarter compared with million in the prior quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were down about to billion when compared with the second quarter however the lower volume was more than offset by higher gain on sale margins commercial mortgage banking revenues were million in the third quarter compared with million in the linked quarter those results reflect a strong originations quarter combined with prepayment fees on loans previously securitized trust income was million in the recent quarter compared with million in the previous quarter recall that the second quarters results included million of seasonal fees arising from tax preparation work we undertake for clients which did not recur in the third quarter also in conjunction with the transfer of mts retail brokerage and advisory business to the platform of lpl financial in midjune of this year about million in revenues associated with managed investment accounts previously classified as trust income are now included in brokerage services income service charges on deposit accounts were million compared with million in the second quarter the primary driver of the increase was customer payments related activity turning to expenses operating expenses for the third quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and mergerrelated expenses previously mentioned were million the comparable figure was million in the linked quarter salaries and benefits were million for the quarter compared with million in the prior quarter as was the case in previous quarters this year the higher salaries and benefits reflect revenue generation in certain business lines and incentive compensation associated with that revenue notably commercial mortgage banking and trust also at the enterprise level we are accruing the corporate incentive at a higher rate in reflecting our expectation that mts fullyear earnings and profits will be higher than they were in other costs of operations in the recent quarter including million from the accelerated amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights as a result of the prepayments of previously securitized commercial mortgage loans that we referenced earlier lastly yearoveryear growth in trust income and assets under management in our retirement business has carried with it an increase in the share of those fees paid to some advisers which are included in other cost of operations also recall that the other cost of operations for the second quarter included an million addition to the valuation allowance for our capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights there were no adjustments to the valuation allowance in the third quarter the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated costs from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the recent quarter compared with in 2021s second quarter next lets turn to credit credit trends continue to stabilize but as has been the case for the past little while some industries are improving more rapidly than others reflecting challenges such as the supply chain pressure on materials costs and the cost and availability of labor mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 the allowance for credit losses declined by million to stand at billion at the end of the third quarter this reflects the million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses combined with million of net charge offs in the quarter at september the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding was unchanged from june at annualized net chargeoffs as a percent of total loans were basis points for the third quarter basis points in the second quarter the allowance for credit losses at the end of the quarter reflects our assessment of credit losses in the portfolio under the cecl loss measurement methodology which includes our macroeconomic forecasts as weve previously indicated our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the largest drivers being the unemployment rate and gdp our forecast assumes the national unemployment rate continues to be elevated compared to prepandemic levels averaging over followed by a gradual improvement reaching by mid2023 forecast also assumes that gdp grows at a annual rate over and annual rate during non accrual loans were essentially flat at billion compared with june but increased as a percentage of loans to compared with of loans at the end of june we also expect to disclose that our level of criticized loans is little changed from the second quarter when we file our third quarter 10q in a few weeks loans past due on which we continue to accrue interest were billion at the end of the recent quarter turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated at quarter end compared with at the end of the second quarter this reflects continued strong organic capital generation combined with lower riskweighted assets as previously noted while the peoples merger is pending we dont plan to engage in any stock repurchase activity now lets turn to the outlook as we enter the final quarter of the year we see a little need to change our outlook for the remainder of we expect yearoveryear loan growth to be flat to up slightly on a reported basis and flat to down slightly excluding the impact from ppp loans which reflects the decline in dealer floor plan loans we continue to expect net interest income to be down a lowsingledigit percentage from full year we noted on the july conference call that we expected net interest income in the third and fourth quarters to on average be in line with the million in the second quarter we still expect that to be true but the faster than expected forgiveness of ppp loans did pull some of that income forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter weve slightly exceeded our outlook for lowsingledigit growth in noninterest income as we begin to retain the majority of residential mortgage loans we originate on the balance sheet residential gains on sale will be primarily driven by ginnie mae repooling gains momentum in the trust and paymentsrelated businesses remain strong expenses have grown faster than we forecast in january but with most of that growth directly connected to better than expected revenue and better than expected net income trend the credit environment continues to improve along with the overall economy but some segments are recovering more slowly than others we believe criticized assets are at or near their peak but there still remains some risk of downgrades within criticized loans from accruing to nonaccruing mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 our preparations for completion of the merger with peoples united continue while we wait for regulatory approval our projections as to the financial impact remain largely in line with what we offered at the time of announcement this past february following our usual practice well offer our thoughts for on the january conference call of course as you are all aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now lets open up the call to questions before which emma will briefly review the instructions question and answer section operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of questions for you regarding your swap book can you share with us where it stands today and how that leads into net interest income over the next six months or months and simultaneously youve been very conservative in the positioning of your cash particularly obviously at the central bank the federal reserve is up dramatically yearoveryear youve been talking about it all year when do you start to lengthen out the duration in that line item on the balance sheet darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure thing well i started writing your questions down so now i wont miss them so on the swap book the swap book has been fairly steady in terms of notional amount right around billion and its been that way since the fourth quarter of last year the received fixed yield were getting on that book has been declining as new hedges roll on and older hedges at higher rates roll off and this quarter if added round number million to net income and impacted the margin by slightly less than basis points well see the notional amount come down next quarter and will start to come down over the course of the following four quarters into the end of the received fixed coupon will come down a little bit as well but the bigger impact will be just the decline in the size of the outstanding notional mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 and the impact of swaps and the hedging just to remind everyone for full year is really close to what it was in and in the impact will be about half and it will be highest in the first quarter of and lowest in the fourth quarter of but to go along with that and to then answer or address your second question about cash weve talked a lot about the cash position over the course of the year if you look at the uptick in the latest quarter it has been largely actually trust demand deposit growth in the quarter that drove a lot of the increase however we are seeing some of the ppp balances as they decline end up in cash and so what you saw this quarter i think if you look at the securities balances at the end of the quarter as they were actually up by about million so we replaced runoff plus million weve been in generally replacing the mortgagebacked securities that are running off and were kind of targeting a duration there or thinking about 20year mbs on average sometimes were buying sometimes were manufacturing by a mix of 15year and years and we were in a little bit well although not in a big way in some of the fiveyear spaces as rates have moved around that was more backend loaded this quarter as rates have started to move up and then the other thing which i mentioned in the prepared remarks where were starting to retain some retail mortgage production and so as we think about duration and we think about whats in our eyes the best choice or maybe the least bad choice of how to invest the dollars right now we do like the mortgage base and if we have a choice between the mbs or retaining our own production we like the yield better on our own production and so we retained about million of production that started through this quarter but had the biggest impact in september and well continue that practice through the fourth quarter and into the early part of next year obviously well be paying close attention to where rates are and how we feel about holding duration either in the mortgage line or in the securities line but thats something that well be watching to put that cash to work and i guess as we look forward at that plan and how it all unfolds taking into account ppp and the hedges that are rolling off we see net interest income kind of troughing first quarter and not declining from there or in fact increasing depending on what you see is the forecast for rates as the year goes on and so when i look at the storm weve weathered and the patience weve exhibited on putting that cash back to work i see us turning the quarter in the next couple of quarters gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and just to clarify one of your comments on the notional amount billion you mentioned million improvement to net income but you meant to say net interest income is that correct darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes net interest income thats correct yes thanks gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right yes okay yeah i just wanted to check on that and then a followup question you were very good at giving us the details on the commercial and industrial loan portfolio what happened this quarter with ppp and mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 also with the floor plan loans can you share with us what youre seeing outside those areas your other customers and then second darren whats the total dollar amount of the floor plan portfolio darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp the total all right so i got to write these down here gerard so other industries whats going on and then the floor plan so floor plan balances are roughly call it billion and if you look at where those have been and whats interesting gerard is when look at floor plan balances really its much about line utilization and the commitments we have with those floor plan dealers and line utilizations are running around which this is the part of the year when those are typically lowest but never that low and when you think about where they are on average in normal times theyre about and so when i look at where those floor plan balances are compared to what i would consider normal its probably billion to billion lower than what might normally be the case when you look outside of the ppp loans youre seeing some movement up in ci business in the areas that you might expect in some construction and manufacturing interestingly a little bit in resources and ag and less in some of the other areas when i look at new originations and what the trends are in new ci originations theyve picked up every quarter this year it would be nice for all of us if they were streaming up but thats just not the case but they are consistently going up and this quarters ci originations were the highest in the last seven quarters with the audio gap you all are well aware that fourth quarter tends to have a little bit of seasonality as folks in industry both in ci and the commercial real estate look to get deals done before tax years and so holding the fourth quarter to the ph side of it was another constructive quarter of improvement and its slow and steady moving up in a direction that we like and the margins are holding fairly solid as well so ph these encouraging trends weve obviously welcome a little bit faster but the trend is our friend here gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you so much darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp one point of clarification id add is on the outlook for the hedge benefit next year that assumes a shortterm rates whether the fed funds target or libor or so forth do not start to ramp up rapidly operator well go next to matthew oconnor deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you could update us on the latest estimate on pro forma capital once the investor deal closes and the marks are done mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure matt just to make sure ive got the question right the question specifically will the deal still be capital accretive or is the question once the deal is done how will we move down the cet1 ratio matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the initial estimate at closing so youre at right now if you dont close the deal your latest thoughts if you close the deal right now where is the go to darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp okay got it perfect its going to be right around there its probably within basis points or basis points of and the reason why im not given you an exact number is when we do the final marks where interest rates are will have a big impact on the interest rate marks which was one of the pieces of helping us be capital accretive and the other thing obviously is the credit marks and with the credit improving that lowers the amount of loans that are classified as purchased credit deteriorated and increases the nonpcd loans which increases the day payments double count and so that will perhaps bring down the impact on capital or reduce capital at close but as you recall that will just increase the accretions to eps as we go forward so we should be right around that spot just north of that would be my belief based on what i see today matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then what are the thoughts on what a near or mediumterm target is for that cet1 ratio and obviously what im getting at is how aggressive will you be on buybacks to get there thanks darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes well i think its fair to say that harboring capital has never been a characteristic of mt and as we mentioned at were near an alltime high and so well be looking to bring that down ideally well bring it down because well have asset growth and well see the cet1 ratio come down as we continue to build the balance sheet and support our customers both for the existing mt and the new peoples customers but based on the trends that will probably be slow and so well look to bring that ratio down when youre generating basis points to basis points of capital every quarter obviously youve got to be fairly bold in your buybacks to bring that down and to run at a pace where it comes down much faster than net basis points to basis points a quarter would be pretty tough and so that will be i think a reasonable glide path to use as you think about what the rate of decrease might be and is a place to look if you go back to how cet1 came down post hudson city and that path that rate of decrease probably a reasonable guide of how it might unfold post completion of the peoples merger matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 okay theres a lot of numbers you threw out there just to summarize you generate basis points basis points of capital per quarter and then you suggested maybe bringing down the cet1 by basis points to basis points just to summarize that darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thats right yes matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes okay thank you very much operator well take our next question from john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the loan front i appreciate all the color you gave around the loan growth dynamics and what youre seeing there i wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your plans for the commercial real estate portfolio longer term i know youre right now youre outsized there at of loans and your peers are closer to and i believe you had expressed the interest in shrinking that portfolio can you maybe talk about what the longterm target is for the size of that book as a percentage of loans and how we should think about the cadence of that decline thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes im happy to talk about that i think the future plans for mt in cre have been highly dramatized in the last little while notably by a favorable quarter in new york city if you look at the impact of cre in the stress test in the december stress test it suggested that there might be more capital friendly ways to participate in the cre industry and so when we look at the relationships we have with clients and how we approach the market our job is to be advisers and financial intermediaries for those customers and historically we fulfill that role by holding the loans on our balance sheet and we will still do that in the future but well think more broadly and include other sources of capital and act as an intermediary on behalf of those clients as we shift to that kind of a thought process it will be a very gradual and controlled shift and so as you think about cre balances and how they might change over time theres some natural decrease that was going to happen no matter what and thats in the form of the construction portfolio right and so theres a number of mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 projects that are ongoing and if you look at cre balances over the year theyve been relatively flat and that some of those construction projects going through their natural cycle with those lines drawing that are building those balances but as those projects come to their natural conclusion and turn into permanent mortgages youll start to see those balances come off our balance sheet and youll see a natural decline in cre not unlike what we saw in the timeframe with the similar period and then as we look at new originations well still think about obviously supporting our clients from a construction perspective but as we look at permanent mortgages and other forms of real estate lending well look not just on our balance sheet but outside and if you think about in real estate we use our mt realty capital corp for agency loans with fannie and freddie and well continue to do that and we also used and placed some loans with insurance company and so well look to broaden those into non agency types of relationships as well but its going to take some time and so i guess the long story short here is the path were on is to be able to actually provide a broader level of service and access for our clients to be capital efficient and well see some of those net interest income dollars become fee income dollars as we make that transition and the decrease that you will see in balances will be gradual as we kind of work our way from where we sit today through the next few years we dont necessarily have a hard target of what were trying to get to but were just trying to get to be a little bit better balanced than we might have been coming into the crisis john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thats helpful and then separately on the expense side could you maybe just talk about any observation of wage inflation impacts that youre seeing in the business and how that impact could that impact as well your expectations around the peoples deal either the cost save expectations or the mergerrelated costs darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess i think the pressures we see on wages both at the bank and in our customers are not much different than its being seen around the country the number of folks exiting the workforce is really putting a strain on those that are looking for folks who are still in the job market and were seeing folks our people being coveted by others which isnt necessarily new but seems to be exacerbated right now i think its particularly acute in the it space which again was always a place where theres been a lot of competition given whats happening in the world with the prevalence of technology in business but were seeing it spreads to other parts of the bank as well when you look at our expense growth thats related to comp really the regular salaries what i would describe as regular salaries have been impacted by it but the full effect wont be seen until next year because its been going up throughout the year and so you wont have a fullyear run rate until you get to and in the meantime whats been driving our increase has been increase in revenuerelated or profitrelated compensation so for our corporate pool we target a percentage of net income for that pool and as net income has gone up so has that accrual and then for some of our fee businesses as those fee revenues increase so do the commissions earned by the employees i think its interesting i spent a bunch of time with the team going through our expenses and if you actually looked at our expense growth in over our expenses actually went down and against our peer group we were one of three banks that actually decreased expenses in and what were seeing this year is a little bit more of a return to normal with a little bit of pressure that we talked about mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 from the outside world which is making the print this year higher than everyone else just because of indiscernible if you look over the course of the last couple of years our expense growth is pretty much right in line with the peers ph thats not a couple basis points below as it relates to pub thats our internal acronym for peoples united bank we believe that the expectations for accretion are still in line with what we thought obviously theyre subject to the same pressures that everyone else is but by and large the cost takeouts are right where we thought they would be the revenue synergies are what we thought they would be in from a capital perspective as we mentioned a few minutes ago we dont see any change there so the rate of return on the deal is still very attractive versus alternative uses of capital and so no real change there but its a challenging operating environment thats for sure john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks darren operator well go next to frank schiraldi of piper sandler frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co morning just on darren on the followup on the dealer floor plan utilization comments as you plan for budget out and think about balances in that year and growth in that year i mean what are your thoughts in terms of those could we see is it expected that well see sort of a bounce back to those older utilization rates and supply chain issues subside or just what are your expectations for there darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well at the risk of being an over mt optimist we believe that those balances will start to come up but knowing our conservative nature we dont see a bounce back in those utilization rates back to normal right away but we do see an increase yearoveryear from what we can see in the industry we hear from the dealers what we believe how the manufacturers will be looking and thinking about things we think it probably into early before youre back to the utilization rates that you were at prepandemic and so given that and without any better intelligence i would think about kind of straight lining that over the course of the next couple of years as we get better information obviously well share that with you but just watching how youre seeing manufacturing come back online we havent seen signs of a material uptick yet in terms of production and therefore we dont think well see the inventories bounce as quickly but we should see some steady improvement over the course of the next four quarters to six quarters frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a followup on the securities book adding the securities in the quarter could you just share what the pickup in the yield is there and i know theres a lot of unknowns in terms of interest rates and moving parts but is that kind of a reasonable expectation of moving into securities purchases on a quarterly basis mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 indiscernible increase in those balances or is this more about just prefunding the indiscernible darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp so i guess on the securities book and on the yield pickup the yields that were putting on now are lower than the rolloff yields and so thats the downside the upside is were putting things on call it ph and were taking it out of basis points and so the pickup there is pretty good when you look at the rate and the pace of us in investing in securities i think what you saw this quarter is a good indication that we at a minimum dont want to decrease the securities portfolio so well work to keep it flat but realistically well probably think about million million increase a quarter in addition to replacing the runoff is a good target indiscernible as we look at it and think about it thats where our heads are today and again ill remind you that the other part of that thought process is retaining retail production right and so were getting mortgage exposure both in the securities portfolio as well as in the mortgage line on the balance sheet and so youll see us deploying that cash and kind of as our treasurer would describe to me legging into the trade as we go through the coming quarters doing a bit of dollar cost averaging into that and rather than trying to solve it all at once frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes operator well go next to ken usdin jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thanks hey good morning darren just one followup on nii understanding the ppp pull forward so you said that nii would be down in the fourth quarter im just wondering what type of ppp are you expecting is it the most of the remainder or what type of level do we step back down to given that pull forward from third darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well its a bit of a guess just because the timing of when our customers might seek forgiveness is a little bit unknown but broad strokes were thinking its kind of half the rate of accelerated capture of those origination fees in the fourth quarter versus what it was in the third just for perspective the third quarter was the highest in terms of the dollar volume of those origination fees that we pulled forward when i look at where we stand from the whole program were the better part of of the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 way through i mean were approaching of the way through and so there might be another million of those origination fees to come we think we see the bulk of that i should say probably twothirds of that in the fourth and first quarters and then it falls off from there and trickles down and so think in the range of 30odd million in the fourth quarter compared to the 60ish we were in those fees this past quarter and then continuing to drop from there ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah okay got it thank you and then so if we just take that out of the third and fourth but then whats happening with underlying nii then is that more stable or whats happening darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp it is ken usdin q analyst jefferies company underneath the surface when you kind of talk to that given that you kind of still talked about your down low singledigit fullyear guide darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes no youve got it exactly right ken i mean the down is also a function of the swaps and the hedge portfolio that we had talked about when we look underneath at the core you know i got to be careful when i use the word core because that means different things to different people but when we look just underneath at the balance sheet and we look at the loans and the deposits and the costs the yields on the loans theyve been relatively stable for the last i would say quarters and we had a slide that outlined that in the document that we posted earlier this quarter and so libor has been fairly stable and most of the loans are priced off libor and so youve seen those yields fairly stable for the last little while and the deposit costs have been fairly stable for a while and so when you look at that book things have been relatively constant and so those yield the spread the margin has been very steady and the portfolio absent the ppp has been reasonably steady as well and so theres a consistent stream of net interest income more typical mt low volatility and these other factors that have caused some of that but those are starting to run their course right and so as i mentioned ppp we had a very strong quarter theres a little bit left to go the hedging is running down and its starting to run its course and the more normal what i would put in their quotes mt balance sheet and lack of volatility will start to show itself and thats why we think we start to hit a trough in net interest income in the first quarter and start to build back from there especially as we take some of the actions that we just talked about rebuilding the securities portfolio and holding some of the mortgage loans on our balance sheet that we start to inflect and go back to the other direction ken usdin q analyst jefferies company mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 got it okay and one quick followup do you know just the amount of ginnie maes that you sold and how much that helped the mortgage banking line as far as in and out of keeping ph million of resi but selling some of the epbo stuff darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp ill be close ken but i wont be exact i think we were within like million to million of ginnies that went out this quarter and the gain i think was about million so just kind of round numbers of where we are theres still a decent balance of ginnies on the books and so the rules there were you had to have they changed all the time which is why theyre still on our books the rules where you had to be months of consistent payments before you could repool it sometimes that got moved around a little bit and got extended to seven months or eight months but were at the point where those should start to repool and come off the balance sheet youll see some of that in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and so again those will put a little bit of pressure on the overall balances but will show up in fee income and is reflected in our comments about growth over the rest of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies company perfect okay thank you darren operator well go next to bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you hi darren following up on darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc just wanted to follow up on your comments on pursuing the less balance sheetintensive strategy to reduce your exposure in cre can you elaborate a bit on how that looks and what kind of revenue impact youd expect that to have indiscernible lose the credit exposure which would be beneficial given the harsh treatment that regulators have been imposing on cres in asset class but curious how to think about the top line effect darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes sure bill i guess the short answer is i dont have a great answer for you and the reason is were still early in the process when you look at what we do today and you see a good analog is what we do in our realty capital business and it produces a steady stream of fee income for us every year and a nice margin obviously its very capital friendly mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 but the pace at which we switch and build the fee income from the net interest income its still nascent in terms of our development and so if you look at what were getting in that line of business today its probably in the million to million range outside of our realty capital corp business and if you look at where some of our competitors are and how big of an impact it has on their fee income were bullish that it can be a good source of income capitalfriendly income that will offset what might be a decline in net interest income and so i guess i would start to look at the fees that you might see at some of our peer banks as a way to start thinking about what it could become but at this point i dont have big plans we dont have big plans for that in terms of hitting the income statement in and well talk more about when we get there were still doing our work but for now i would think about it as if theres a decrease in cre net interest income it will be offset by fees as we do gain on sale in that line of business and then well come back to you with a little bit more detail on what that shift might look like as we finalize our plan bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats really helpful darren and then thinking about ccar as a followup to that as youre binding constraint any thoughts on how long before i guess these actions get reflected in your stress capital buffer it sounds like its going to take some time and so from that standpoint would it take some time to show up in the lower scbs such that we could see it migrate back down your required level of capital somewhere back towards the range darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah bill youre thinking about it exactly the right way obviously the next time were a category bank and so as a category bank we go through the stress test every other year and this year thats upcoming will be a ccar year for mt and we wont have made these changes to be reflected in that stress test which means youre at least two years away from that and then what will happen is the impact will work its way through the stress test in a couple of places so the first place youll see it obviously is in the riskweighted assets and in the losses that are assumed under stress but the other place that you see it is you see it in the ppnr right and so the ppnr as a percentage of riskweighted assets should go up which will be more better producing of income and capital to absorb losses under stress and over time that will work its way into the stress test as well and so not much you will see in the version well start to see it in the version but i would really think youd see it in is when it would start to come in but as i said theres a number of reasons why were thinking about this not just because of the capital efficiency but we think it actually broadens the level of service we can provide to our customers and just as a reminder our current scb is the implied one from december would have brought it up higher but thats not our actual scb and well see where the scenario ends up this year but if its like meaning in but if its like it was in the stress test just passed we would not expect to see an scb at the rate that it was calculated in the december scenario that was run which was a pretty severe scenario bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 so then the quick followup to that is is there anything that could change your mind as to perhaps unwinding the decision to kind of the assetlight thought process around cre or is that a direction that you all want to head in i guess its not a foregone conclusion that regulators or is it a foregone conclusion that regulators are going to be harsher treating cre more harshly darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp i guess i wouldnt say its a foregone conclusion bill the way i think about it is if you look over time theres been a stress test for a number of banks every year and for many banks every other year and each time theres a stress test theres a different scenario that goes through that process and different asset classes are stressed and each one of those scenarios leads you to an outcome and gives you more insight into how portfolios perform under different economic scenarios sometimes they stress cre sometimes they stress mortgage sometimes they stress credit card sometimes they stress indirect auto and so you got to go through a series of these and each of those are data points that help inform your thinking and what we got in december was a data point and its informing our thinking and its not telling us that we want to never do another cre loan as long as we live but it said to us that there are certain asset classes and certain types of loans and how long they might exist on your balance sheet that carry a different loss assumption and therefore a different level of capital that you need to support them and so well look at the mix of assets that we have on our balance sheet and be thinking like we always do about how to optimize returns and whats the best use of our shareholders capital well still have cre on our balance sheet but we think that moving down this path has a number of upsides that we described in terms of capital efficiency and balancing out our income streams between net interest income and fees and most importantly it gives us another outlet to help support our clients and so for those reasons well move down this path i dont think theres any turning back from that thought process i think the question really is just as talk we about i think in answering your first question whats the pace at which we get there and the market will to some extent dictate that pace based on clients and talent but like anything we do well be thoughtful and measured in how we execute bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful darren thank you for taking my question darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp no problem operator well take our last question from christopher spahr with wells fargo christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon just my question is related to the roll out technology and the integration of peoples united if you can contrast that with the hudson city deal and the integration there and this is all assuming that the integration takes place in the first quarter of next year mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp okay i dont think my answer will change on the impact of technology if it doesnt happen in first quarter but ill start with that one i guess if you look at technology chris and different conversions and different mergers bring with some different levels of complexity and so to kind of compare and contrast the ph four people our most recent two mergers hudson city was probably one of the least complex system integrations we did i mean were basically converting mortgages and time deposits and so when you think about complexity of products those are about the easiest ones there are there was no trust business there really was no commercial business to speak of no cash management and treasury management the usage of the web and mobile were pretty light and so that was a very straightforward less complex conversion if you went all the way to the other end of the spectrum i would look at wilmington trust now there was a merger where we had traditional bank products both consumer and commercial but we also inherited a number of new wealth and trust businesses that we werent really in a big way and so that one was much more complex in terms of the planning and setup for that i would characterize the peoples as down the middle and that it certainly looks much more like wilmington trust with a little less emphasis on trust but we gained some outside businesses in mortgage warehouse lending as well as in some equipment finance that we wouldnt have and so well be looking to maintain those systems and set them up and be able to run them but the flip side is the core banking system that peoples runs on is fis and so thats one deconversion from fis onto our platform thats something weve done before weve done it a number of times before and so we know the game plan of how to execute that and so when i look at the different things that we need to get done to prepare for that integration were progressing along we know what the path forward is and were preparing to do what we need to do to minimize the disruption to customers to make it easy for employees to be able to service those customers and the path is known and so i would characterize this one down the middle of the two ends of the spectrum not without its challenges but in the grand scheme of things not the most complex system conversion that weve had to execute christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks i guess it should be clear so assuming that you do get approval in the fourth quarter you can begin the conversion process in the first quarter of next year correct darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp assuming we get approval i guess i would just caveat the fourth quarter as if we get approval on december 1st or past its probably going to make the first quarter a challenge and so depending on the timing of the approval there might be some pushback on when we actually complete the system conversion and so well see where that happens but its obviously our objective to complete that system integration and conversion as quickly as practical once we have our approval and we complete the legal close mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 because i know youre well aware chris weve never been folks to maintain multiple deposit systems and multiple loan systems any longer than we have to because it creates risk and its not cost effective and so for those reasons we would look to find an ability and a path to complete the system conversion as quick as practical once we know for certain when our approval is and our legal close christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator and this does end our allotted time for question and answers ill turn the call back over to don macleod for closing remarks donald j macleod
