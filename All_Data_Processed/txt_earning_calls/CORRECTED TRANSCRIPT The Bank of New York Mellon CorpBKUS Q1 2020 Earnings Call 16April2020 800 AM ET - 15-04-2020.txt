focus on how were navigating the current realities discuss what the immediate impact has been on our business and then look at how we think about the potential impact going forward mike will then go through the financials in more details for the first quarter we reported earnings of million and earnings per share of thats up over the first quarter of with revenue up and expenses flat as we benefited from heightened levels of market activity and volatility partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates all of our investment services business showed solid growth clearly we have entered an unprecedented environment where things are changing quickly and its going to be a very challenging time for everyone as the the situation has evolved quickly but from the start our focus was on the health and wellbeing of our people and the continuity of service to our clients we quickly transitioned the vast majority of our people to working from home which opened up space for us to create social distancing for the small number of essential and office staff fewer than of our global employees remain in the office these essential inoffice staff are primarily performing roles that cannot be done remotely the investments weve made in our infrastructure operating platforms and cyber information security have clearly benefited us enabling us to support this broad scale remote working arrangement all of the controls and security oversight that govern us when working inside the office are in full effect when were working remotely the response from our people has been exceptional you couldnt ask for greater professionalism or dedication to our clients at a time when were also dealing with unprecedented levels of market activity and personal challenges please note that while our people are caring for our clients were caring for them we have made available to them a host of health and wellbeing resources including access to telehealth services free testing for covid19 in the us along with us covering all costs related to outpatient urgent care or emergency room visits for the evaluation and treatmentrelated to covid19 recognizing the mental health challenges during these uncertain times we made available a stress management program and emotional support services and resources to help our people cope and deal with the social isolation and were supporting our colleagues who are unwell or may have been exposed by guaranteeing full pay for absences for those who have tested positive or are selfquarantined were also providing paid time off to care for immediate family members with covid19 or covid19like symptoms finally to support our people we made the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 the decision that we will not do any additional layoffs during its absolutely the right thing to do at a time when the pandemic is creating so many personal uncertainties for our people since the crisis began weve remained fully operational and open for business and weve been there for our clients during this unprecedented period of market disruption we engaged early with thousands of clients globally to discuss their own continuity plans and work with them to ensure minimal disruption to their operational processes and transaction settlements we stood up client command centers for our operations and clientfacing staff to centralize escalate and quickly resolve client inquiries we accelerated training on our digital tools to help clients reduce their physical and manual process footprint minimizing their operational risk profile weve also taken a series of humanitarian actions in an effort to and help those negatively affected by the virus that has included making philanthropic commitments to import and support organizations in regions where our employees live and work including organizations working in the front lines in the us emea and mainland china and other affected areas in asia and india announcing a twoforone matching program for employee donations weve also donated hundreds of video capable tablets to public hospitals in new york to help patients and medical staff communicate with their loved ones and partnering with nonprofit organizations to provide aid to first responders healthcare transit and other frontline workers as well as serve some of the most vulnerable populations through the provision of critical items such as meals shelter medical equipment educational supplies and financial support as well as facemasks we donated to two new york city hospitals dealing with shortages well also continue to look for opportunities to do more lastly we are focused on maintaining the strength liquidity and lower risk profile of our balance sheet while using it to support our clients and markets we have been in regular dialogue with the regulators and key market participants to ensure were coordinated and see how we can help bring stability to markets when the markets first came under pressure last month the federal reserve activated a primary dealer credit facility to provide funding to primary dealers they achieved that through our triparty repo services thats something we are uniquely positioned to do and its been a privilege to help given our strong capital and liquidity position we have used our balance sheet to support our clients that means accommodating their elevated deposits and funding about billion in incremental draws on committed facilities in march we also purchased more than billion in assets from money market funds including our own to help create liquidity for fund holders and we have continued to do so in april looking ahead we and our clients face extreme market and economic uncertainty while its too early to predict the impact we have a welldiversified and financial resilient franchise that is relatively well positioned to withstand whats to come in terms of the immediate impact on our business march had extremely high levels of volatility and market stresses we experienced much higher client volumes than normal and activity is up across all of our business lines let me just share a few data points that bear this out in foreign exchange we saw higher volumes across all parts of our business up approximately in march and large spikes in volatility in us dollar payments treasury service on average processed trillion payments per day in march peaking oneday at over trillion in midmarch compared to trillion in recent quarters the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 at times pershing saw elevated trading volumes to times normal levels in clearance and collateral management us government securities clearance volumes in march were up more than from february levels driven by the heavy us treasury issuance coupled with increased market volatility in asset servicing during march we experienced an increase in us accounting trade volumes of more than versus the first two months of and global security settlement volumes were up approximately over the same period weve also experienced substantial deposit inflows in asset management we experienced net inflows driven by cash inflows of billion and our performance fees were up due to solid performance across our largest strategies as you think about our companys performance over the rest of the year i would caution against extrapolating these results for the full year the full ramifications of the lower rates and the moves in the capital markets are not yet being fully felt the decline in our capital ratios this quarter reflects large deposit inflows mostly due to the flight to safety from current market conditions and fed balance sheet expansion share repurchases of million were completed prior to deciding along with the other big banks to temporarily suspend further buybacks so that we can use our significant capital and liquidity to provide maximum support to our clients we believe that we will have the ability in a wide range of scenarios to continue to pay our dividend and to support our clients looking ahead to the remainder of it is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus on our results with certainty because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves its impact to the economy and issues actions taken by central banks and governments to support the economy we have a lower risk feebased business model that positions us relatively well in an environment like this we perform stress tests regularly as do our regulators in ccar we consistently performed well we have a highly diversified business model with a conservative risk profile and fees in general are skewed towards recurring revenue streams we should benefit from increased activity in clearance and collateral management from increased issuance of us treasuries and us triparty collateral management although the latter somewhat depends in federal reserve bank of new york operations monetary policy during times of uncertainty tends to have a positive effect for us through lower excuse me through higher deposit volumes and we will continue to manage our expenses tightly all that having been said the lower interest rate environment which impacts us both through net interest revenue and through money market fee waivers in pershing asset management and corporate trust as well as the market decline in certain industries being under pressure will have an impact and mike will cover those items in more detail later still we believe we have the capital and liquidity to withstand a multiple of scenarios pay our dividends and continue to support our clients finally i wanted to take a moment to convey how deeply honored i am to be ceo of this great company while my nearterm focus is on safeguarding the wellbeing of our employees supporting our clients through this period and maintaining our balance sheet we are looking ahead to ways to build on our solid foundation with a strong business model and balance sheet to drive improved performance and capabilities across our company with that ill turn it over to mike the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 michael santomassimo chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thanks todd and good morning everyone first let me echo todds opening comments there are an incredible number of people in our communities who are either out there on the front lines or providing essential services to help the rest of us and our families not to mention all the people in government and our industry who are working together to help the economy help people pay their bills and ensure the smooth functioning of the global markets were thankful to all of them with that said let me run through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearover year basis unless i specify otherwise beginning on page of the financial highlights document in the first quarter of we had earnings of million and earnings per share of up and respectively comparisons versus the fourth quarter of are impacted by the notable items we incurred last quarter specifically the gain on sale of the equity investment which was partially offset by severance and litigation expenses and net security losses total revenue was billion or up fee revenue increased primarily driven by higher foreign exchange and other trading revenue higher transaction volumes and increased activity from existing clients across investment services and higher performance fees in investment management which were partially offset by equity investment losses and losses from consolidated investment management funds net interest revenue declined to million yearoveryear and was flat to the fourth quarter we increased our provision for credit losses by million in the quarter this was driven by the macroeconomic outlook in conjunction with the application of the new cecl accounting standard our actual losses or net chargeoffs were million during the quarter expenses were essentially flat driven by continued investment in technology and the higher pension expenses we spoke about last quarter partially offset by lower staff expense and the favorable impact of a stronger us dollar we had a solid return on tangible equity of and maintained a pretax margin of in terms of shareholder capital returns we repurchased million shares for million the majority of the repurchases were completed in january and were all completed ahead of the march announcement by the financial services forum member banks regarding the temporary suspension of repurchases we also paid million in common stock dividends in the first quarter now moving to capital and liquidity on page our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums the declines versus the prior quarter primarily reflect this quarters very strong deposit growth that increased the size of the balance sheet common equity tier capital totaled billion as of march and our cet1 ratio was under the advanced approach and under the standardized approach our average lcr in the first quarter was and our slr was and a reminder that effective april the revised rules will allow us to deduct central bank deposits and us treasuries from the slr denominator under the new rules the slr would have been approximately turning to page my comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes net interest revenue was million flat to the fourth quarter despite lower rates in the quarter the results were better than what we had expected driven by the elevated deposit levels particularly in the last three weeks of march we the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 also benefited from higher securities and loan balances and the widening of libor to fed fund spreads this was offset with the negative impact of hedging activities which are mostly offset in trading and other revenue the increase in loan balances in march was primarily driven by clients drawing approximately billion from their committed credit facilities and elevated overdrafts higher overdrafts are normal when there is an increase in market volatility and the overdrafts are generally well secured the net interest margin of basis points was down basis points versus the fourth quarter page describes how deposit balances trended over the course of the quarter deposit balances were close to flat to the fourth quarter average through the first two months and if youll recall we had some episodic activity last quarter so balances were running a little ahead of where we modeled before the increased market volatility in march in march deposits increased over billion on average and billion on march which you can see in our supplement all of the businesses saw increases with the largest dollar increase in asset servicing through the first two weeks of april deposit balances are down from the march levels but remain elevated moving to page our average interestearning assets increased to billion approximately of these assets are held in cash or reverse repos while are in our securities portfolio and are in loan portfolio in addition to the funded loans in the page we also have unfunded committed lines the details can be found in our annual report and will be updated in the 10q i will give you an overview of the funded loan exposures of the portfolio is related to highquality mortgages and well secured investment credit lines provided to our high net worth wealth management and pershing clients to date we have received a limited number of forbearance requests related to the mortgage loans and are working through them with clients the investment credit lines performed well during the market volatility are margin loans primarily in pershing these loans are well secured and have performed well during the recent volatility as well are to financial institutions and are composed primarily of shortterm traderelated loans to investmentgrade banks with tenors less than one year and secured loans to clients including asset managers who often borrow against marketable securities held in custody of the portfolio is in commercial real estate approximately of the loans that are are secured with moderate leverage and solid loantovalue ratios roughly of this exposure is related to hotels and retail they are predominantly these are predominantly with clients with whom we have longstanding relationships many over multigenerations the remaining exposure is primarily to reits the majority of which are investment grade and are well diversified across industries and the remaining is commercial lending these borrowers are primarily investment grade now turning to the securities portfolio we have a highquality liquid portfolio much of it is in us government agency securities us treasuries and sovereign debt the portfolio increased as we deployed more cash into securities including the commercial paper and cds we purchased from our affiliated and thirdparty money market funds the billion of clos are highly rated with aaa and the remainder aa or better of the nonagency cmbs are aaa and have solid subordination the rest of the ratings breakdown can be found in the supplement page provides an overview on expenses on a consolidated basis expenses of billion were up slightly driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs offset by lower incentive expenses the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 now turning to page total investment services revenue was up assets under custody andor administration increased yearoveryear to trillion as higher client inflows were partially offset by lower market values and the unfavorable impact of a strong us dollar within asset servicing revenue was up to billion primarily reflecting higher volatility and higher client driven volumes in our foreign exchange service higher transaction activity higher deposits and new business growth with existing clients in pershing revenue was up to million primarily reflecting higher clearance volumes particularly in march it was also driven by a onetime breakage fee related to a potential client that will not affect the run rate and higher client assets and accounts for new business onboarded as well as existing clients issuer services was up to million with growth in both corporate trust and depositary receipts revenue depositary receipts revenue was driven by crossborder settlement activity while corporate trust reflected net new business and higher deposit volumes treasury services revenue was up to million driven by higher deposit balances and higher payment volumes deposit balances increased yearonyear by reflecting the environment and our investments in new capabilities and increased focus on deposit gathering clearance and collateral management revenue was up to million reflecting elevated volumes and balances across clearance triparty repo and global collateral management average triparty collateral management balances in the us and globally were up and respectively page summarizes the key drivers that affected the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of the investment services businesses now turning to page for investment management total investment management revenue was down asset management revenue was down yearoveryear to million primarily reflecting equity investment losses including seed capital as well as unfavorable change in the mix of aums since the first quarter of partially offset by higher performance fees and the positive market impact performance fees of million were up from million a year ago due to good performance in some of our international active equity portfolios as a reminder our performance fees tended to be the highest in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters we had inflows of billion in the quarter most of which was in cash overall assets under management of trillion are down yearoveryear due to the unfavorable impact of a stronger us dollar wealth management revenue was down yearoveryear to million primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue due to lower interest rates now turning to our other segment on page revenues were roughly flat yearoveryear while expenses declined by million primarily due to lower staff expense now finally a few comments about the second quarter ill walk you through a number of variables that were watching closely having said that ill encourage you not to put too much emphasis on a point in time view as the variables are changing quickly the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 as for net interest revenue as i mentioned deposit balances continue to be elevated but lower than the march levels we are expecting balances to stabilize above the february average but below the march surge we will see the full run rate of lower interest rates on our funding costs and asset yields including the securities portfolio we would expect between to of the securities portfolio to reprice in the second quarter the forward curve for libor fed fund spread shows a narrowing from todays levels and in the portfolio we are monitoring prepayment speeds of the mortgagebacked securities as they may be volatile in the current environment so using the forward market curves and our best estimates right now we would expect net interest revenue to be down sequentially between to changes to any of the variables mentioned could both positively or negatively impact the estimate we also expect that the low interest rates will begin to impact money market fee waivers this impact will be felt more in pershing initially but will also impact other parts of the firm the total impact is difficult to estimate but could be between million to million in the second quarter net of lower distribution expense higher yields and shortterm instruments may help reduce the impact in the second quarter the first quarter foreign exchange and trading revenue was impacted by the significant increase in market volatility and associated client volumes primarily in march levels have subsided somewhat in april but still remain elevated compared to the recent historical lows in additionally the substantial increase in transactional activity in march across many of the businesses which todd noted was exceptional and not likely to reoccur we will also see the full impact of lower equity markets although some have begun to recover on expenses were continuing to focus on driving down discretionary expense while protecting our most important investments and continue to reprioritize spending given the environment we would now expect full year expenses to be approximately flat yearonyear including the expected 50basis point increase in pension expense credit costs will be highly dependent on individual credits and how the economic forecast change by the time we get to the end of the second quarter and in terms of our tax rate we would expect the full year effective tax rate to be between and now before we go to qa i just want to congratulate todd on behalf of the management team on being named ceo its welldeserved and really good news for us and the company and with that operator can you please open up the lines for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 question and answer section operator absolutely operator instructions our first question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you can you hear me thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp we can gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great congratulations todd on the new role you certainly deserve this so congratulations thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you give us a big picture answer obviously you guys are one of the chief plumbers of the financial system and we saw as you pointed out extraordinary volumes in so many different areas can you give us a read from the inside how the system handled all of the surge it appears you have handled it well but maybe you can give us some firsthand examples of how well the macro system worked to the surge in activity thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah ill take that gerard so its todd i think its impressive how well the system did handle the huge increases in activity i mean there are a couple of glitches but not many and for example in our clearing and collateral management business we went to work from home very early on and all of that worked quite smoothly and so we saw volumes increase overnight but we had the technology and the capacity to manage it so i think im pretty impressed across the board where we saw resiliency and disaster recovery plans that had to change a bit too because typically a disaster recovery plan would be focused on a region but this was obviously global and so the move to work from home was wherever it could be executed was executed so a couple of occasional glitches constant conversations between the clearing counterparties as well as our clients we had many thousands of conversations to make sure that we were connected and that they knew how they could connect with us we there was a lot of mobilization to the use of our portal and electronic means of communication which made things much simpler so i mean i think it was an impressive reflection of the strength of our financial system and the infrastructure of it the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and then a more specific question obviously cecl hit your provision for the quarter similar to other banks twoparts first what kind of economic assumptions were used to come up with that provision that you put into the first quarter results and then second if you could identify where most of that was allocated was it to you mentioned some hotel exposure or to financial customers would be helpful as well thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike do you want to take that one michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah yeah sure gerard ill take that so id say first as you think about the reserve that we built a very small piece of it was due to individual either borrower downgrades or the incremental loans that we saw drawn and most of it was really reflective of the changing economic environment and the new accounting standard and as we think about the outlook that was in there the outlook takes into account multiple scenarios and we used that changing environment to inform what we did and as you look at it it was a meaningful waiting towards a very a prolonged recessionary scenario that doesnt fully recover until you get into so i think thats the way i would think about it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning can you hear me thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp we can brennan theres a little noise in the background brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yes sorry its another earnings call thats overlapping but im trying to have dueling cell phone here apologies first off todd congratulations on getting the role of ceo they kept us in suspense for a while but glad to see we got to the right prize quick one on deposit cost trends so they came in better than expected it was probably helped by some of the timing of deposit growth but is there a way you could help us think about that line in maybe how much it was averaging and then what you expect to continue to see as far as some relief on the deposit cost front would be great thanks the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay mike you want to take that one as well and thanks michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah yeah sorry sorry about that yeah so brennan as you think about it so as you know the fed moved pretty substantially in the latter or the middle of march i guess and we adjusted our pricing there and so you only saw really a couple of weeks of that embedded in the first quarter averages and so as you look at the full run rate impact of that its going to be a pretty substantial increase down for the cost of interestbearing deposits and so and the beta obviously changes as you get close to zero but i think youll see a pretty significant decline as you get down for the rest of the quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks for that and then when we think about the servicing lines i believe mike that you talked about how there were some strength from volumes which aided the line which you guys flagged during as well in early march and it was great to see it come through but it seemed as though you cautioned about that sustaining is that because you have seen some of those volumes already subside and can you help us think about maybe how much of a contributing factor that was so we could maybe calibrate for how to adjust in our forecast thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so mike you want to start and maybe ill add a little color michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look i think if you think about what we saw as todd mentioned in his script brennan is is the volumes we saw in the latter part of march were exceptional and they went from for lack of a better way to describe it zero to overnight and as we look at what were seeing post quarter end the volumes are still higher than they were before the surge but certainly off the peaks that we had in the latter part of march and i think as you look at the goforward expectation its really hard to predict with a high degree of certainty how long theyll stay elevated and come down back to normal thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah yeah id add a little color i mean in some of the businesses like clearing and collateral management so if you think about our government clearing business thats continuing to sustain itself at very high level because the government is issuing a lot of debt and theres a lot of trading going on around that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 the collateral management business is probably a little bit off from where we saw it at the peak but i think secured lending will become more and more it will continue to be important in the industry and were likely to see growth there but the very high volumes for example that we would have seen at pershing the transaction volumes are going to fall back to what we think more normalized levels which theyve begun weve begun to do and weve seen that in asset servicing to a certain extent as well brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right well ill try and triangulate those factors thanks a lot for the color thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brennan operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning congratulations todd thats great news thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had a question around the prefs now that the rules are set in april the kickoff date for the new rules could you give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that capital stack and what you would do with the prefs here thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay mike ill turn that one over to you michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look obviously betsy as you know were in the middle of ccar so were not going to talk much about what our capital plan looks like at this point but as you think about where given the increase in the balance sheet where were most constrained right now is tier leverage and i think as you think about perhaps that could be a good depending on how long we remain constrained there that could be a good way to continue to fund that i think were going to continue to look at opportunities to either refi perhaps if that comes back in the market and pricing comes back to where it was just four five six weeks ago so were continuing to look at the capital stack and well give you more once ccar is done the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then when im thinking about the funding mix theres room for your funding cost to come down obviously with not only deposits but in looking at the longterm debt is there some opportunity there as well in this environment to reduce the funding costs thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp to reduce longterm debt is that what youre suggesting betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes well just looking at the yield on the longterm debt is there room there to bring that down in addition to the deposit cost of funds here over michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah well i think well lower rates are going to impact our funding costs overall right and i think youre going to see that come through in the second quarter so i think you will see that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator thank you next well move to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone mike can you talk a little bit about more about just helping us understand because its been a while now on the fee waiver side so the million to million can you just help us understand what that means when you say net of distribution expense where it shows up in the income statement and then would there be logically just because rates are going down a bigger potential impact as you move past just on the direction of rates michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes i think ill try to give you a little bit of the things that were thinking about related to that but so first and foremost this is going to have an impact on government funds first right as you think about where yields are and one of the variables that makes it pretty hard to estimate right now is just where tbill yields are so over the last three weeks theyve gone from negative to 20plus basis points back down a bit now over the last day or so the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 and so thats going to be a big driver of the when they start when fee waivers start to kick in and the depth of them as well and so you have to keep that in mind and as you think about the funds in our asset management business that may get impacted by it that may be distributed through other parts of the company some of those fee waivers will be offset by lower distribution expenses in those businesses so youll see the fee waivers come through the fee line and then youll see distribution expenses lower as they start to impact those funds ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike a little bit ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi todd thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey ken ill add a little bit to that its important to note the difference between prime and government funds so the yield in prime funds is can certainly support the fees initially there was avoidance of prime funds so and were starting to see some investors come back to them so that could have an impact that would neutralize some of it and mikes point is there going to be enough yield in assets and government funds to generate the fees and the huge amount of issuance in tbills has kind of surprised us a little bit and put a little bit of yield into that but that cant be certain that could come down again ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and just a followup on the cost side obviously youre adjusting to try to keep costs flat in this environment can you just talk about a little bit more about what do you shift do you push out some investment spend is it an incentive comp adjustment what are the ins and outs of your ability to hold the line there that youre attempting to do thanks guys and best of luck todd thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you mike do you want to take that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we havent seen so first we havent really seen any impact on our most important investments and as you look at the investment portfolio and you get deeper into the list theres always opportunity to reprioritize the timing of some of those things and so were doing that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 youre going to see ill state the obvious but youre going to see lower travel and business development costs that will be part of it although todd said were not going to have any restructuring or layoffs through the rest of the year were also putting a lot of discipline around new hires that were bringing in during this environment so i think its a multitude of factors that you highlighted that help us have the confidence to get there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks guys operator thank you well next move to brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc oh great thanks good morning and also congrats todd good to see you get the indiscernible with maybe todd thanks mike for giving us a pretty good outlook for the activity levels coming into the second quarter but todd maybe you can give us some perspective on what you kind of see for the rest of the year obviously extremely difficult to predict but with the government intervention and the uncertainty about the path to recovery how are you seeing that potentially impact some of the key business lines in activity and also including comments on the backstop on the fed on prime money funds to the extent you can get much more confidence in people investing in prime funds versus government thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah well first of all as i had mentioned were seeing a little bit of that so we are seeing a little bit of positive flows into the prime funds but if you look at activity levels we would expect them to obviously come down from the surge that we saw toward the end of march but probably be elevated and again anything we say theres just so much uncertainty to the environment and situation that we face and its really hard for us to look out longterm until we get on the other side of the health crisis but that being said we wouldnt expect to stay at the extraordinarily high levels that we saw in march with the exception perhaps of our clearing and collateral management business just because there is going to be so much debt issuance but in the rest of our businesses the transaction volumes component of pershing business the same thing in asset servicing we would expect that to moderate just about under any circumstances unless we just saw another couple of blips and more of a what i call a seesaw activity that could take place over the remainder of the year brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then the organic growth efforts that youre doing as well like in deposit gathering and then collateral management indiscernible is that on track or is that are they suspended in this environment thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 yeah i would say if you look at the organic growth especially around the deposits i mean we have seen some positives there obviously there were surge deposits that are just going to be associated with this interest rate environment in this financial environment but when we look out at our other businesses we have room to gain some market share i think weve done that in our payments business we had some good wins in the first quarter in our asset servicing business i would expect under this environment people are probably going to slow down making a whole lot of transitions weve got a healthy pipeline both in our asset servicing and pershing business im not sure a lot of people are going to make a whole lot of change we are seeing some new fund complexes come on but were also seeing some being deferred brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thats helpful and then mike just real quick on nii outlook into the second quarter does that exclude fx hedging activity michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean fx has not fx but the hedging activity is hard to predict because its at a point in time at the end of the quarter so were not making an assumption either way on that at this point brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great thanks very much for taking the questions operator than you operator instructions well next go to the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks good morning congrats todd quick question on pershing and kind of what youve been seeing with all the changes going on in the industry and kind of what that means for the pipeline in that business has it helped or is it too early to say at this point in time thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah ill make a couple of comments and mike can add some color first of all i think its a little early to say pershing has a different model and i think clients are quite interested in seeing a more open architected approach to what some of their competitors are doing so i think the conversations are quite healthy there i think the pipeline continues to be strong theyve come out with a very competitive subscription priced alternative to meet whatever the demand of that client base is were continuing to invest in our advisory services business so i dont think its i dont think theres any significant impact that were seeing from some of the consolidation elsewhere in the business other than its making us a little bit more of a differentiated alternative and id also i mentioned that pershing did quite well through the crisis so it was able to keep its technology up and running the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 and accommodate the surge in the growth which in some instances as we pointed out it was three to four times i dont know mike do you have anything to add to that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp and then i would just say brian more broadly outside of just pershing i think were seeing the benefits of a lot of the investments weve been making over the last couple of years and i think clients are seeing that as well i know anecdotally we heard from a client that just what we brought on to our middle office service late last year and saying im not sure how i could have done this without you and couldnt have dealt with all of the increase in the volatility on my own and so i think were seeing that sentiment really across more broadly across the client base brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just a separate question on those deposits that you saw come in and surge in march theyre rolling off the balance sheet now are those just going more so into your own liquidity products and thats been factored into the few waivers that you gave in the second quarter are they just rolling off completely thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp well why dont i take that one and then mike can jump in if you think about what happened in the ecosystem so when there was a lot of draws for example under these commitments around the country a lot of that cash had to go somewhere some of it was deposited back in banks and a lot of it went into government funds initially government funds had nowhere to invest so a lot of that ended up in the money market funds where we were the custodian so we saw that big spike thats now a lot of that spike has normalized itself out as there are other alternative investments for those government funds some of those were our own money market funds and some of them were competitor money market funds i think thats the biggest the biggest most volatile component of the cash that we saw move brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator thank you our next question goes to mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi so i guess you are provisioning times your level of chargeoffs i only bring that up because what economic scenario are you assuming in taking those provisions thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike as i said earlier we used a multiple many scenarios that go into thinking about what the ultimate reserving looks like but its a scenario where you dont see a meaningful uplift or doesnt fully recover until youre into the middle of next year so you start a recovery in the latter part of the year and you it doesnt fully recover until later in as i said earlier as well only a small portion of the reserve is related to either actual borrower downgrades or the increase in the loan portfolio the remainder of it is related to the changing economic environment and the way that flows through the new accounting standard mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess so what im getting to is its not just unique to you its the industry so it seems like youre planning for kind of a u recovery but you have an infrastructure for a v recovery like your youre retaining your employees your expenses should be kind of flat this year im going to guess youre not changing tech spending but im not sure if thats correct so help me reconcile keeping an infrastructure for a v recovery while your underlying premise is for a u recovery thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp do you want to take that mike or do you want me take it michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp do you want to start thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay yeah well why dont i start so we did give a guidance or might give guidance that we do expect expenses mike to be lower than they otherwise would have been we think that having the human resources here is the right thing to do not only for them but also to position ourselves well to service our clients through this kind of an environment trying to make any significant changes just wouldnt be particularly prudent on our part that being said we are controlling other components of our cost we want to continue to make the investments in technology that we can im sure some of that will be delayed or and could be somewhat different prioritization but were going to keep a very close eye on expenses we think we can do a little bit better than the guidance that we had previously given for a number of reasons and we are talking about a ushaped type of recovery which means you do need those resources to continue to support our people in this kind of an environment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just last followup then just on the tech spending so you expect some delay or like what was your tech spending going to be what will it be now or how should we think about that part the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we are committed to continue with spends that weve gotten and thats what weve indicated im certain that a couple of things might end up being delayed a bit but im not going to pull that out of our plans at this point in time by any means mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you well next go to alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for taking the question and to echo everybodys comments congratulations to todd question for you guys with respect to just broader liquidity in the system clearly theres been a tremendous amount of cash flows coming to the sidelines and thats both the fed action as well as the general risk call it backdrop how should we think about bks ability to absorb these deposits so changes to spot slr definitely help but theres lots of other considerations so kind of help us to think through the ramifications of this a little bit longer term and how the balance sheet could ultimately be in terms of size beyond the first quarter thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay mike do you want to take that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think the slr change is helpful thats out there but i think as you look at our constraints on the balance sheet its been tier leverage based on the overall size of the balance sheet and i think we have been able to work through that with our clients pretty effectively so far and as todd said as the environment normalizes a bit for the money funds and the rate environment settled down weve seen those real surge balances come off and so our expectation as things normalize more is that the balance sheet will either hold steady or come down from where we are right now and so we feel like we can work through that pretty effectively at with the current capital that weve got alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for that and then just a couple of cleanups around nir can you help quantify the hedging benefits in the quarter i know it hits nir and shows up in fx so just to clean that up the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2020 and also any sense of new money yield on the fixed portion of the securities portfolio as that matures and gets reinvested just trying to get a sense of the headwind to nir beyond the second quarter on that fixed sale of the portfolio thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure so ill take the first piece on the hedging benefit so this is kind of really simple we have interest rate swaps in the portfolio and the way they are valued every day creates some basis risk between ois and libor and really all were doing is hedging that basis risk thats created from interest rate swaps and that impact for the quarter is based on where it all ends up on the day at the end of one day at the end of the quarter so theres really nothing else happening there and you can kind of see the relative impact on the slide in the presentation and so thats a hard thing to predict in terms of where its going to end up at the end of the quarter as you think about the securities portfolio i mean you can kind of see where rates are right now as you think about both the fixed rate and the floating rate piece of the portfolio and i think as we look at our investment strategy going forward were doing whatever we can to try to get some yield out of it and i think the reinvestment rates are down from what you saw obviously in the second quarter but just a reminder the overall duration of the portfolio is just a couple of years right so were not buying a lot of 30year treasuries as we think about this portfolio and i think were doing our best to try to keep that spread up as best as we can while within the risk appetite were in alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks very much thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks alex operator thank you and gentlemen we have no further questions in the queue at this time id like to turn the conference back over to mr todd gibbons for any additional or closing remarks thomas p gibbons chief executive
