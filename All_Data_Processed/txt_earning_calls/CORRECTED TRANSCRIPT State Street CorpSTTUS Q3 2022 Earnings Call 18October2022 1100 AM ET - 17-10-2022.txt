to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thank you ilene and good morning everyone continues to unfold like no other year in recent memory with the challenges faced today arising partly out of but acutely different from those the world faced in during the onset of the covid19 pandemic and while the global operating environment continues to be very challenging our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our business model and our focus on maintaining and further improving state streets pretax margin which was a solid in the third quarter excluding notable items during the third quarter financial markets were negatively impacted by the adverse effects of the ongoing war in ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds including continued price and wage inflation dramatically higher interest rates significant us dollar strength and heightened fears of a global recession these factors collectively drove heightened uncertainty which contributed to meaningful declines in both global equity and fixed income markets as well as increased market volatility which in turn impacted flows state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 we continue to carefully navigate the business through this environment while the operating climate created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our business in third quarter the savings and efficiency of our alpha and enterprise outsourcing offering makes our value proposition even more attractive to asset managers and asset owners in the current market and inflationary environment we maintained a solid balance sheet and strong capital position delivered significant nii growth as well as healthy fx trading revenues and remain laserfocused on intensely managing what we can control as demonstrated by our expense management turning to slide of our presentation i will review our third quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail starting with our financial performance third quarter eps was or excluding notable items compared to or excluding notable items in doubledigit yearover year declines and average global equity market values drove most of this decrease total fee revenue for the third quarter declined yearoveryear primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees as well as the stronger us dollar within total fee revenue our global markets franchise once again continued to perform well with fx trading services and securities finance revenues increasing and yearoveryear respectively as the business was able to benefit from increased volatility while supporting our clients we also drove a solid result within frontoffice software and data with third quarter revenue increasing year overyear total revenue for the third quarter declined just yearoveryear as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a very strong nii result which increased relative to the yearago period driven primarily by higher interest rates faced with continued marketrelated fee revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures we remain focused on controlling expense growth even as we invested in our people and business third quarter total expenses were flat both yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter primarily driven by the impact of the stronger us dollar and expense management business momentum was solid in the third quarter with new auca asset servicing wins amounting to billion encouragingly our third quarter wins include expanded relationships with two existing alpha clients demonstrating our ability to broaden and deepen client relationships and drive new backoffice mandates through our alpha strategy as a result of this quarters solid sales performance auca won but yet to be installed with trillion at quarter end front office and data also experienced good business momentum in the third quarter with annual recurring revenue increasing yearoveryear to million at global advisors assets under management totaled trillion overall third quarter aum flows and management fees were negatively impacted by weaker equity and fixed income markets but we still saw positive net flows into our cash spy and us lowcost etf products during the quarter even in the volatile environment our global institutional money market business has continued to gain market share this year with aum reaching a record level in third quarter having experienced four quarters in a row of inflows we remain excited by our global advisors strategy and the growth potential of the franchise and announced new leadership in the third quarter as yiehsin hung will become ssgas new president and ceo in december i would now like to turn to the proposed acquisition of brown brothers harrimans investor services business which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions the current regulatory environment for ma transactions involving gsibs is challenging we are engaged in ongoing dialogue with us and international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory review process state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 we have developed with bbh proposed modifications to the transaction including changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and a reduction to the purchase price we anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat more complex and included delay in timing and amount of deal synergies resulting in a slower path to accretion while discussions with regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing the likelihood of a successful outcome is increasingly uncertain there can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be agreed and enter into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for a modified transaction the modifications to the transaction remain subject to review and approval by both bbhs partners and our board of directors as previously noted the sale and purchase agreement allows each of state street and bbh the right to terminate the transaction upon written notice without a contractual penalty at any time we continue to believe the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling and that has encouraged us to continue to seek an acceptable path forward these efforts are actively underway and as we previously stated we expect to reach a decision on whether the transaction can proceed forward during this quarter turning to our balance sheet and capital despite a continued rise in interest rates our cet1 capital ratio was a strong at quarter end as i have noted previously we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders and it remains an integral component of our mediumterm targets accordingly having already announced a per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend earlier this year we now intend to repurchase approximately billion of state streets common stock in the fourth quarter under the existing common stock repurchase program authorization which expires at the end of additionally in keeping with our mediumterm targets it is also our intention to return greater than of earnings in in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases subject to approval by our board of directors and market conditions at the time if the proposed acquisition of bbh investor services does not progress we would expect capital return to be significantly more than that amount to conclude the events of the last years have demonstrated the resiliencies of state streets business model during times of heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty even as financial markets broadly declined in the third quarter we delivered a healthy pretax margin of excluding notable items in addition to solid new business wins while the environment is challenging and uncertain we remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute against our strategic agenda and improve our operating model and financial performance over the medium term for the benefit of our clients and shareholders as we look ahead we will continue to adapt to the highly uncertain environment by remaining intensely focused on managing what we can control as our solid expense discipline in todate has demonstrated with yearto date total expenses flat to the same ninemonth period in even as we invested meaningfully in our people and business and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone ill begin my review of our third quarter results on slide we reported eps of or excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed in the panel on the right of the slide as you know the operating environment in the third quarter remained challenging with persistent market volatility related to ongoing geopolitical tensions inflationary pressures rapidly rising interest rates and concerns about the global economy despite these challenges as you can see on the left panel of the slide strong growth in both net interest income and our fx trading services business enabled us to partially offset the significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter additionally we continue to demonstrate prudent expense management in the third quarter even as we experienced ongoing price and wage increases while we continue to invest in the franchise turning to slide during the quarter we saw periodend investment services auca decrease by on a yearonyear basis and sequentially the yearonyear change was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across equity and fixed income markets globally a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of currency translation partially offset by net new business installations the quarteronquarter decline was largely a result of these same factors similarly at global advisors periodend aum decreased yearonyear and sequentially the yearon year decline in aum was largely driven by lower periodend market levels institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation which was partially offset by positive net flows in both our etf and cash businesses turning to slide on the left side of the page youll see third quarter total servicing fees down yearonyear largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels lower client activity and adjustments normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation partially offset by net new business excluding the impact of currency translation servicing fees were down yearonyear even with the negative impact of the market environment in the quarter i would highlight that were pleased to see good doubledigit growth in our private markets businesses sequentially total servicing fees were down primarily as a result of these same drivers lastly we recorded traditional custody wins worth billion in the quarter with attractive fee rates across key client segments and we now have more than trillion of assets to be installed a good portion of which are attributed to large alpha deals that were won over the past year given our large backlog we installed approximately billion of assets this quarter which is in line with our historical pace turning to slide third quarter management fees were million down yearonyear primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels a previously disclosed clientspecific pricing adjustment institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and positive net etf and cash inflows management fees were down quarteron quarter largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds and the impact of currency translation state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 notwithstanding the challenging backdrop in the quarter while we did see some outflows in our etf business due to an exit of a lowyielding asiapacific fund our franchise still remains wellpositioned for growth in etfs we saw sustained etf inflows into the spdr lowcost suite and fixed income funds in our institutional business theres continued momentum in defined contribution with third quarter inflows of billion including the target date franchise in our cash business topquartile performance on our government money market fund was a major driver of net inflows which contributed to market share gains in the institutional money market funds on slide fx trading services had yet another strong quarter relative to the period a year ago third quarter fx trading services revenue was up primarily driven by higher fx spreads driven by higher market volatility and the recent regulatory capital changes partially offset by lower client fx volumes quarteronquarter fx trading services revenue was down as the benefit of higher fx spreads was more than offset by lower client fx volumes which tend to be lower in the summer months securities finance performed well in the third quarter with revenues up yearonyear primarily driven by higher spreads due to higher specialty activity only partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to falling market levels sequentially revenues were up mainly reflecting higher agency spreads third quarter software and processing fees were up yearonyear primarily driven by higher frontoffice software revenues associated with crd which were up while lending fees were down due to changes in product mix finally other fee revenues of negative million in the third quarter declined on a yearonyear basis largely due to negative marketrelated adjustments sequentially we saw an increase in other fee revenue primarily reflecting fewer negative marketrelated adjustments moving to slide let me provide some details on the performance of the frontoffice software and data revenue in the third quarter on the left panel of the slide frontoffice software revenues increased yearonyear as our more durable and recurring softwareenabled revenue continues to grow nicely driven by new client implementations and continued success in converting clients through our cloudbased saas platform environment sequentially revenues were up due to higher softwareenabled revenue partially offset by lower professional services revenue our revenue backlog remains healthy turning to some of the crd and alpha business metrics on the right panel we continue to be pleased with our new bookings for the business the million of new bookings from this quarter was welldiversified across client segments particularly wealth and asset owners demonstrating the benefit of and breadth of clients the platform can now support as for middle office we continue to have extremely healthy uninstalled revenue backlog of over million which is up on a yearonyear basis as i mentioned earlier now turning to slide third quarter nii increased yearonyear and sequentially primarily reflecting the impact of higher shortterm interest rates from central bank hikes only partially offset by lower client deposits more than of this increase was driven by nonus dollar rates as we saw central banks globally raise interest rates on the right of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter as a result of a rapidly changing rate environment industrywide deposits have begun to trend lower and we are seeing some of this play through our balance sheet as well excluding the impact of currency translation average deposits were down state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 both yearonyear and sequentially primarily driven by the global tightening in monetary policy by central banks and by the impact of significantly lower market levels on auca the investment portfolio is down modestly as we continue to manage duration and we now have more than in htm as to todays results reaffirm our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to recognize this interest rate and nii tailwind and also protect aoci turning to slide third quarter expenses excluding notable items were once again proactively managed in light of the revenue environment and flat yearonyear were up approximately adjusted for currency translation and notable items weve been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts which generated approximately million in yearonyear gross savings or approximately million yeartodate which puts us in line to achieve our fullyear expense optimization guidance of to of the expense base it also contributed to our yeartodate positive operating leverage which we also expect to deliver for the full year these savings in addition to benefits from a stronger us dollar enabled us to offset some of the wage inflation we have been seeing in the industry while we continue to invest in the strategic parts of our company including alpha private markets and operations automation on a linebyline basis compared to third quarter compensationemployee benefits were down as the impact of currency translation was partially offset by higher salary costs associated with wage inflation and higher head count headcount increased primarily in our poland and india global centers as we invested in important technology capabilities and added operations talent to support new products and services in growth areas such as alpha private markets and in middleoffice servicing theres also a portion of the head count increase associated with some hiring catchup post covid we expect head count growth to start to level off information systems and communications expenses were down as we began to see benefits from our insourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments transaction processing was down mainly reflecting lower subcustody costs related to equity market movements occupancy was down largely due to currency translation and other expenses were up primarily reflecting higher securities processing costs marketing costs travel costs and foundation grants moving to slide on the right side of the slide we show our capital highlights we are pleased to report cet1 of up basis points quarteronquarter primarily driven by higher retained earnings and wellcontrolled rwa with respect to rwas there is volatility and i would caveat that they were lower than we expected this quarter we would anticipate some rwa increases that we continue to both optimize the balance sheet and efficiently put capital to work across our businesses third quarter tier leverage ratio of was up basis points quarteronquarter mainly due to the decrease in balance sheet size and higher retained earnings as the slide highlights our capital position is strong and our commitment to being stewards of shareholder capital remains steadfast in keeping with that commitment we returned million to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and as ron highlighted we now intend to repurchase approximately billion of state streets common stock in the fourth quarter this higherthanexpected buyback amount is based on our healthy capital levels and our expected future uses of capital the afs mark to market and oci this quarter amounted to million negative as compared to minus billion in meaningfully improved as a result of the management actions we took despite another strong runup in interest rates this quarter state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 turning to slide we provide a summary of our third quarter results despite the continued volatile market environment im pleased with our quarterly performance even with the current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties our strong growth in net interest income and fx trading services enabled us to partially offset another quarter of significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets highlighting the resiliency of the franchise and our expenses remained wellcontrolled demonstrating our laser focus on productivity turning to our outlook let me share our current thinking regarding our fourth quarter and some of our macro assumptions as we look over the remainder of the year at a macro level while market rate expectations have been volatile our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards which suggests the year end fed funds rate of we expect other international central banks to continue to raise rates in and beyond into as well our outlook assumes equity market levels will be flat to september monthend which would imply a quarteronquarter decline in global daily average equity markets in we also expect continued us dollar strength to be worth about percentage point of headwind to fee and a tailwind to expenses on a quarteron quarter basis which is included in our guide so in terms of the fourth quarter of given the expected decline in average global equity market levels we expect total fee revenue to be down about on a sequential quarter basis with servicing fees down to quarteronquarter and management fees down quarteron quarter turning to nii following yet another strong sequential increase in nii in we expect to deliver additional nii growth of to quarteronquarter driven by the tailwind from us and foreign central bank rate hikes this outlook includes our expectation for some continued deposit outflow in for the full year we now expect nii to increase to which is better than our prior fullyear guide of to we also expect continued good growth in nii in fullyear next we expect total expenses excluding notable items to be roughly flat quarteronquarter despite inflationary wage pressure as we continue to target productivity initiatives in the face of a challenging environment for fee revenue this focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage and a healthy pretax margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year full year expenses are expected to be flat versus last year finally we would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately to for the quarter and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator lets open the line for questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi there so maybe just a wrapup question on bbh and i appreciate all the transparency along the way but regulators hate it more complex market values have fallen i definitely am with you on the strategic merits but i guess the question people have is why not just walk away it seems like you could do some really accretive stuff with the capital now and at what point do you just say not worth it not as accretive to complex enough said ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp glenn its ron maybe needless to say we go through that calculus that youre describing every day and thats part of whats led to this i mean obviously the regulatory environment is driving the timeframe here but whats driving our work is that tradeoff the tradeoff between the opportunity to consolidate on a global basis a very attractive firm versus whats the alternative uses of the capital including returning it back to shareholders we believe theres still the possibility that we can get this we can structure this transaction in a way that it will work both for shareholders and to achieve that strategic objective but as weve said in the disclosure the likelihood of that happening is going down so i think what you can take away from this is one of the reasons thats driving that decrease probability is the calculus that youre describing glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay well i guess we dont have to wait that much longer so i can still help for another couple of months just one followup on i think you mentioned of securities portfolio has been moved into held to maturity it shows in the smaller aoci hits as rates go up whats the other side of it like do you can you calculate what the nii giveup or any other offsets to moving that large of a piece in held to maturity eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp glenn its eric weve carefully considered what portion of the investment portfolio move to held to maturity and in what amount but what we do as we make that consideration is the benefit is that you largely dont give up nii right by and large youre earning the coupon and whether there are treasuries or agencies or mbs just in a different accounting form and structure but the earnings of the corporation are the same and thats whats quite attractive about htm the reason why you wouldnt put the whole portfolio in htm is partly you want some flexibility you want to from timetotime rebalance the portfolio and you might want to rebalance yards and that takes an afs construct under which to do it and then partly you want to make sure that you always have monetization at the frontend to maximize and to maintain the liquidity construct that youd like state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 weve now put that in place we can repo htm securities in size we test that in the marketplace so were quite comfortable but theres a point where you say look id rather sit on cash or id rather sit on available for sale and so we feel like were at a good balance now that really provides a real positive nii trajectory and you see that weve guided now to to up in nii this year and ive also started to signal that were positive on the nii trajectory in and partly because of the entire investment portfolio whether its an afs or htm is contributing to that to the upswing glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks eric eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator and next well go to ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys i wanted to come back to putting the deal into context with the buyback that you announced which you have been clearly saying youd want to get back into the buyback this quarter so could you just help us understand the billion sizing and if that has anything to put in context with your thoughts around how the pricing and eventual outcome if the deal goes through might end up coming through or is it completely separate and just based on where capital sits regardless of the deal outcome eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp ken its eric as ive said in my prepared remarks the buyback was larger than anticipated and part of that is we do two things we look at our current capital levels which have trended towards that cet1 mark that we had guided to remember that discussion we had in the fourth quarter and then partly because partly as we consider the capital uses over the next couple of quarters including the possibility of the brown brothers investment services transaction and you would expect us to factor in any adjustments downward adjustments to purchase price that we would expect and thats effectively what weve done so its a mix of factors but those are the components and i think were quite pleased we can now proceed with billion as ron said we were planning on comfortably returning more than of earnings to shareholders next year quarter by quarter by quarter which is what our mediumterm targets are and that still availed us the capacity to do a deal at an admittedly adjusted price if its appropriate at the time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then on the denominator side i guess of capital can you just give us a little color on how youd expect deposits to traject from here pretty meaningful decline in both interestbearing and noninterestbearing just relative to where youre ending here just your general outlook on your thoughts around deposit mix and flows thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think our deposit trends will probably be in line with some of what youre seeing in the industry i think were within that zone of if you look at the fed reports if you look at other institutions and weve certainly begun to see that rotation out of deposits this quarter down about both yearonyear and quarteroverquarter adjusted for currency translation i think what we have seen over the last year is a series of factors that have impacted it and this is my way to say that i can give you some guidance but its going to vary depending on how the factors play out so you have us dollar appreciation and so you have a nondollar deposits are come down as a result we have equity markets falling which means the aucas that we custody for are coming down and with that investors institutions retail hold similarly lower cash amounts and so part of whats happening here is the environment is actually affecting deposits somewhat independently of where we are with rising rates and quantitative tightening now we are seeing the effects of rising rates and quantitative tightening as well so i kind of give you that as a background because i think there are four or five factors at play here which is more than expected i think as we look forward we continue to expect some deposit outflows in the fourth quarter we expect those to be somewhat less than we saw in the third quarter but we do expect some and those are factored into our nii guide and one of the reasons why we have a wider nii guide than usual is because theres a range of outcomes but were seeing what we expected were seeing what we expected as rate drops and we price carefully and maintain i think some healthy betas this quarter were seeing noninterestbearing begin to flow out because with the higher rates both in the us and internationally the us in particular you have the difference that clients can earn and then one of the things were doing with our clients is to think about the full range of offerings for them sometimes its the base account sometimes its special accounts with deposits if you remember weve historically put in place deposit initiatives to have the right balance of deposits on the balance sheet and then the other thing that this is feeding is some of our other businesses whether its the cash business in ga whether its the repo business theres a whole set of product offerings that cash flows to that were pleased to support our clients with so theres quite a bit going on in this area more to come but were comfortable with some of these forecasts and what i find particularly important to keep in mind is nii continues to rise even with some of these deposit outflows and part of that is the us rates that were also familiar with but given that so much of our balance sheet is international those foreign rate rises are particularly helpful and those deposits are at good levels as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks eric operator thank you next well go to alex blostein with goldman sachs your lines open state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey ron and eric good morning guys i was hoping we could speak a little bit more broadly around state streets capital allocation strategy if bbh does not go through whats your appetite for any other deals whether its in the services space or asset management space obviously macro conditions are pretty volatile so im sure that will impact that as well but curious how youre thinking about the tradeoff between accelerating buyback or other deals and then if you do go down the path of more buybacks should we be thinking about the upper end of your cet1 and leverage as sort of the target to which you will go to or you might need to run with a buffer sort of on top of that given uncertain macro conditions ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah alex why dont i begin on this just on how we think about ma its not like we have a shopping list here bbh is a unique opportunity to consolidate the market on a global basis and by that i mean its not just about adding to some particular geography but it really does bolster us in all the major geographies that were in having said that weve got our own what we believe is a distinctive organic strategy in the servicing area led by our alpha proposition which continues to grow there is a lot of development that was being completed this year and early next year which will lead to a lot of new onboardings and we think even make the proposition attractive to a broader set of clients so we always are looking in the marketplace to see if theres something that makes sense but its not like the money is burning a hole in our pocket and if this doesnt work were immediately going to go out and come back with something else eric you may want to talk just about how we think about in context of buybacks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah and alex i think id add that were quite conscious that we raised almost billion of equity from our investors and diluted them we certainly expect that if the deal doesnt proceed that the bulk of our excess capital needs to go back to shareholders thats deserved and i think expected and we would deliver on that i think in terms of capital ratios i had said earlier this year when the economic environment felt more benign and when we had simplified and attenuated a lot of the oci risk in the investment portfolio that we might be willing to go down to the lower end and even below the lower end of our to range i think now given the economic uncertainties we for the time being expect to operate towards the middle of that range that might change over time but for now i think our current expectation is we have reduced the volatility in the investment portfolio which reduces on one hand the need for a capital buffer to some extent on the other hand the economic environment has much more volatility in it and that pushes us in the other direction but the net of that is that i think were quite comfortable with the to range and operating somewhere in the middle there state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you thats helpful my followup question may be around the business side of things you guys have a very sizable pipeline of installations on the servicing side a lot of them are alpha mandates which obviously tend to be a little bit more complex you talked to us i think on the last call sort of the cadence of how thats going to come through on the revenue side but im just kind of curious how you would contextualize any incremental investments or expenses that will need to come with it given sort of complexity of those installations over the next to months ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah ill start alex on the investments and eric can talk through the pattern on the investments there is actually ongoing development as i mentioned earlier and that development much of some of which is being completed this year some of which is being completed next year but its all part of our medium term plan as well as our budget so there is nothing out of the ordinary that you should expect to do this and in fact much of the development is behind us or will be behind us at yearend within the trillion as you would expect its the larger more complex alpha mandates in some cases theyre development partners with us where were developing new features and functionality which will be available not just to that particular client but more broadly to the client base so these are important things to get done important things to get done right and we think are a good use of our investment dollars because theyll result not just in being able to onboard that client but to be able to broaden the offering eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and then alex id add that we certainly need to plan and begin to set up onboarding teams those are well underway and so you saw a head count tick up this quarter for example expenses though were well controlled the head count was in our hubs and some of the lowercost markets purposely so were navigating through that but some of the expenses have to be put on in advance of as were doing the onboarding in advance of the installation and the recognition of revenue and some come as the revenue comes on but i think as ron said all this is within our expense guidance itll be within our expense guidance when we get to that in january for next year and our view is that we collectively need to continue to drive margins in the right direction given our medium term targets that needs to be a mix of both the revenue lift were getting from alpha deals as well as the expense and productivity initiatives both within the alpha environment and across the traditional franchise and all that has to come together to deliver on our financial commitments alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you both operator thank you next well go to brennan hawken with ubs your line is open state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning ron eric thanks for taking the questions id like to ask on bbh it seems somewhat unusual to be getting regulatory approval before the approvals within the company so why is that happening and given that there is risk of deterioration loss of talent customers ron you made reference to this during the last quarter call when you guys first said you were renegotiating would you have the ability to adjust price further if this process drags or has that been set already ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp on the approvals our board has been actively involved in this brennan as has the bbh partners on their side throughout this process so obviously there was an approval before we announced this and in september of theres an ongoing consultation with our board and weve walked them through modifications but we dont have a final deal yet largely because we have not actually gotten through the regulatory process and figured out what the actual structure would be that will satisfy all of the regulators so its not completely binary and that were not talking to our board until its all done but obviously our board needs to see the entire thing in total and be able to make that decision in terms of the ongoing kind of risk to clients and people thats there it continues were spending a lot of time with clients as i think ive mentioned before about half the client base is a shared client base so these are clients that we talk to anyway i think theres still a strong desire on the part of our clients that if this can be completed in a way that makes sense theyd like to see it completed so i do not worry about further client attrition we obviously are worried about people attrition on both sides but largely on the bbh side and were monitoring that closely and to the extent to which we felt like after the price reduction weve already negotiated that circumstances have changed sufficiently further that we needed that again of course we would raise up if we needed to do that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that ron and then second question is maybe a bit well i would just come right out so why is this so strategically compelling i mean it seemed as though it was largely a scale deal now its deteriorated you said earlier ron that the accretion is probably going to be more drawn out and its going to be lower than initially planned its more complicated so youre introducing a lot of operational and legal complexity i get it youre lowering the price but is this really a good use of time is this really a good use of management focus why not just understand that the environment deteriorated the regulatory approvals didnt come through it couldnt work as constructed and so its better off just to walk ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp i mean again im probably repeating myself a little bit brennan here but thats exactly what we ask ourselves every day and youre right it is taking a lot of management time i think whats compelling about it is several things one is its footprint many of the things that are out there or supposedly out there rumored to be out there tend to be single geography kinds of things and if you have a strong desire to be in that geography maybe it is state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 something useful but there i would describe as a best tactical this one is add scale to us everywhere where we are and it really does set it apart from the others secondly its got some technology assets that we like weve talked about those in the past third its got a set of people and professionals that we believe are equal to and sometimes even better than some of our people and thats attractive to us but that has to be weighed against all the factors that you and others have raised here and we continue to do that which is why were not coming here saying to you yes this is were ready to go were not ready to go its also why were coming here saying to you that we recognize this has gone on long enough and that we need to bring this to a close this quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc amen to that thanks for all the color operator next well go to steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to ask one clarifying question on nii some of your bank peers theyve indicated exit rate could be close to the peak this cycle just as lag deposit pricing begins to catch up with rate hikes you noted that the nii eric will be up nicely yearonyear but do you see the potential for nii coming in above that annualized level suggesting that that fourth quarter niis guidance is not going to be representative of the peak eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think youre trying to get deeply into our forecast and i think its a little premature to do that i mean to be honest lets see how deposits flow and evolve this coming quarter lets see whether the us central bank and the foreign central banks continue to have the wherewithal to tame inflation because thats important right or are they going to or not so its quite dependent upon all that i think the reason i made my positive statements about is that we dont see fourth quarter as the quarterly peak we think theres more that more nii upside over subsequent quarters we also have a balance sheet that has a mix of usd and nonusd and in some cases we tend to have more foreign deposits and those are areas if those foreign central banks continue to hike and address the serious inflationary environments and their geographies that give us an additional tailwind then maybe different than a us bank so theres certainly momentum here i dont want to get into fourth quarter annualized versus my current view of but i did say good continuing growth purposely i think theres more to come on nii but i think well know more in a quarter or two to be honest but we see a trajectory that is good and reasonably positive given what we know in the environment today steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that eric so reading the tea leaves i may scrap my question on the expense growth algorithm and what that implies for next year but the one area i did want to unpack on expense is the margins in the state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 investment management segment theyre down about basis points yearonyear thats an area where you made significant progress over the last couple of years certainly youre going to see some pressures given the declining market but wanted to get a sense as to how much expense flexibility you have there and where you think you can actually hold the line on the pretax margin for that particular business eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think id start answering that question by saying were actually quite pleased by the progress weve made in growth and margins in the investment management business over call it the last three years i think it had teens level margins if you go back in time that we got into the some of that was the market uptick which flowed through the management fee line some of it was a i think delivering strongly on flows and net new revenues was positive across the franchise cash as an example continues to be a standout but each of the three franchises have new products and offerings have been quite good and i think what the teams done there well is as they have secured those flows launched those new products theyve also managed the expense base and so just because it was a tailwind from equity markets or fixed income markets or from flows theyve actually kept expenses remarkably flat in that environment or flattish in that environment which i think is a testament to how theyve navigated the environment i think what you should expect is that a couple of things if equity markets continue to operate at this level we need to continue to work on expenses and productivity becomes an even bigger focus there as it should be across the company i think on the flip side of that if we get some kind of rebound in equity in fixed income markets that plays through the asset management business financials i would expect expenses to continue to be disciplined there and margins to certainly go back to some of the higher levels that you saw but i would say i think at margins were quite pleased with where we are and i think there is depend on where equity markets go i think the trajectory will continue in a generally positive direction steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color eric thanks for taking my questions eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator next well go to brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is now open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much for taking my questions just want one quick cleanup on bbh can you close that deal if it all works well can you close that on december or earlier and buy back the billion and do you need to have that tier leverage ratio be within or above your target range in other words can you do this and be at say the low end of the target range just temporarily for or even below state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brian its eric i think the timing of this deal is quite uncertain given where we are weve not been able to complete the regulatory process and theres still so i think thinking about this in months as opposed to quarters brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp is premature weve done the buyback calculation though fully considering the reduced price that would be part of the brown brothers transaction and so whether the timing is quarter x or quarter y were comfortable proceeding with the billion were pleased to get it started in the coming days and regardless how that plays out be able to return as i said and as ron said comfortably more than the that weve committed to throughout next year at a minimum brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great and that is great and then just one on the deposit betas maybe if you can just talk about how you how you see them right now as they exist in terms of like how youre defining them for both the us versus the nonus and then as we move into next year maybe sort of an outlook without giving nii guidance of course but just sort of a range of where you think the terminal betas could be in the us versus the nonus even if its a fairly wide range eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me describe it this way and let me cover us and nonus to because both matter in a positive way for our books i think the betas this quarter in the us were in the range were pleased to see that those are up from about last quarter but exactly where youd expect us to be where we expected to be given the uptick in rates and next quarter if we go from this quarter to beta the next quarter wed be quite comfortable and then it just continues to inch up thats just how it plays through in euros were also in that range as weve started to cross into positive territory for central banks and we expect that to continue so part of the reason for the nii forecast into fourth quarter and into next year is that we expect betas in the to range in euros the market operates a little differently than the us but that would be in the range and then in pound sterling betas are lower they tend to be in the to range there and then you can keep going aussie dollars canadian dollars and so forth and we have a balance sheet that is prepared for rate rises across those currencies as well and then youll just see betas notch up quarterover quarter i think at the terminal level theres always some amount of lagging that you do thats just how it happens you never get to beta or anything near that because you have some noninterestbearing and you have some lagged deposits but well see were comfortable where we are in the range going to and i think itll play out well for the nii and the balance sheet accordingly state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay thats great color thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator next well go to jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning eric maybe just one last question on nii and i apologize but as we think about big picture fed funds being potentially basis points or more higher than european rates being positive versus negative back then do you see anything conceptually to suggest your nim shouldnt be higher than back then or just wanted to get your thoughts on that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp jim its eric im a little more focused on nii than on nim and the reason weve done that is because weve actually changed the shape of our balance sheet over time i mean remember weve added some deposit initiatives which tend to be at lower nims but they are niiaccretive and positive and we do that because sometimes we want to balance currencies around the balance sheet we want to raise deposits where we want to land we need to keep deposits for intraday there are lots of reasons why we have different mix of the balance sheet and weve done that purposely in an engaging way with our clients over the last two three years so i dont think as a result the balance sheet is bigger and part of the reason weve allowed it to be bigger is that the leverage ratio is not particularly constraining on us and so what our intentionality is actually to maximize nii as opposed to nim so i think as you play that out i think our nims are lower at this point than they were last time in the cycle and i think theyll likely be below the nims will be below the highs of the last cycle on the other hand i think if you calculate the forecast weve given you for nii for fourth quarter so the next quarter that were about to print that will be a new high of nii relative to what we had seen in the last cycle and thats where were a little more focused because thats what comes back to shareholders and what creates earnings and earnings momentum that contributes to the bottom line jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay fair enough and just maybe on the blackrock etf transition how much is left and do you see that as a material any kind of a material impact on forward revenues eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp our guidance has been pretty consistent on this and i think youll find it in our 10qs and ks that we estimate that the revenue outflow is about percentage points of fees so that hasnt changed you saw some of that begin to come out this quarter that was worth about million this quarter if you kind of get to the fullquarter amount itll state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 be just under million for fourth quarter and that was worth about trillion of auca so that did occur and well continue to keep you updated on that but as weve previously disclosed and talked about deconversions just take time and itll play out some time towards the second half of and then into will probably be the majority of it but well just see were working closely with blackrock we continue to be quite pleased with all the existing business we do with them and the work we do for them in the alternative servicing area which were one of the largest providers and well certainly help them if they want to evolve diversify and support their plans jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks operator thank you next well go to gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good afternoon eric and ron eric can you remind us you talked a little bit about it in your prepared remarks about fee revenues the pricing pressure that you see every year can you remind us if that number has changed a bit at all and second as part of that i think youve also indicated in the past you needed a certain amount of assets under custody to neutralize that pressure and dont remember i think it was trillion but i could be wrong of new business wins to neutralize that downward pricing pressure eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard let me start that and it is an area that we continue to work on the pricing headwinds are just a condition of our industry why because as you remember pricing is aum or aucabased and so as equity markets go up clients expect some of that to come back to them the pricing headwinds on an aggregate basis in the servicing fee line are about percentage points of headwinds a year and while we saw that bubble in thats come back down that ticked up and then its been well managed back down to that or so level and thats what we are seeing today were not seeing anything different than that and its well within our expectations in terms of wins we always want to focus on net new business and for net new business to drive a positive impact on the revenues as they did this quarter i was clear in my prepared remarks that net new business was positive we had some nice wins we actually had some nice wins and nice fee rates right because both matter to your point the benchmark ive put out there is that we expect about trillion of auca wins a year to be in a good positive direction and trajectory for net new business but to be honest as the cfo i would like to see a little more and youve seen last year was particularly strong this year yeartodate i think were already comfortably at that level and we still have another quarter to go so the sales momentum continues and what i find important is it continues to cross both our traditional custody and accounting business and our alpha offerings and so its been broadbased state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah go ahead ron ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp what i would add is on the topic of pricing we mentioned to you at the end of the second quarter that we launched a targeted repricing initiative that is well underway and its focused on the areas of high value or where costs are increasing higher than in other places and that is intended to and is to achieve margin preservation in other words to offset the cost of delivering something high value or to offset the increasing costs in areas for example where we have disproportionate market data and things like that so that initiative is well underway when we talked to you last time it just launched so we were in the dozens of clients now were in conversations with the tripledigit number so were pleased with that progress too gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and has it been wellreceived or understood i should say nobody likes price increases but are the clients understanding of why this conversation has to take place ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah i think understood is the right word gerard i think that these are sophisticated institutions themselves they see whats going on so i think its been for the most part understood gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then eric as a followup can you remind us what percentage of assets under custody or under management are variable rate priced products meaning your customers pay basis points on the assets under custody and so therefore to your point when the value goes up and down obviously it affects revenues eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah its a bit of a mix across different segments and across geographies but a good rule of thumb is are asset under custody base so move up and down with market theres another that of the pricing tends to be based on transactional activity and we actually saw transactions volumes dtcc trades wire transfers state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 derivatives transaction so forth come down this quarter and then the last tend to be relatively fixed or sometimes semifix the number of funds you custody for or some flat fees gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc gentlemen thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you operator okay next well go to mike brown with kbw your line is now open michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my questions i guess on bbh i suppose its been a while since weve gotten a financial update on the business and how its performed in this volatile environment yeartodate and clearly there is a possibility that we have a resolution that could end up moving forward with the acquisition so as we think about our models here and getting those kind of aligned with how bbh is performing anything you can share on how the company has performed yeartodate eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah were obviously monitoring the business performance closely monthly quarterly and i think its you should expect you can go back to some of the materials that we had shared a year ago september as the base case but you could take that mike and extrapolate some of what youve seen in our book of business right were an asset managementoriented custodian you can even look at some of our peers as benchmarks and i think youd find what weve seen which is that there is a sharp boost in the nii in their book or nii plus fees because of the mix of programs that they run for their clients cash partially offset id say with some downdraft in servicing fee rates equity in bond markets and then youd see a bit of uptick on the fx services kind of business so i think its ours and other large custodians are a parallel to what youve seen and so its something were considering but as we talked about earlier were conscious that we need to think about this from a couple different perspectives but its performing in line with what we and you would expect at this point michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay understood thanks for that color eric maybe just one last cleanup one for me how should we think about how the unrealized losses on the afs portfolio could accrete back over the next call it to months as we think about your capital ratio or how that will impact the capital ratios over that time period eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 yeah it is part of our capital forecasting now and it was actually included in some of the buyback and capital return estimates that we provided not only for the fourth quarter but also for our intentions related to next year i think this quarter the accretion was worth million or so of capital and thats just the reversal of that mark accreting back as the bonds mature there tends to be a little lumpiness to it but thats the start of the accretion and so it did provide some amount of modest tailwind and well certainly factor that in right because just like earnings create an opportunity to return capital to shareholders the accretion does as well and thatll be a part of that builder capital ratios which then we can share back with shareholders michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you for taking my questions eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator okay next well go to mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just to clarify so in the next weeks we should either expect you to say that youll proceed with the bbh deal or that you wont be proceeding and maybe therell be an extra billion buyback am i interpreting that correctly ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp what you should take away from what weve said mike is that by the end of this quarter we will have a decision on whether to proceed forward or not to proceed forward on the buyback first we need a board authorization for further buyback and well communicate what were intending on buybacks after that authorization mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just i know that the first question of this call was why dont just walk away and thats been the topic let me just take the flip side just im sure youve invested a lot of resources and time and thought into this is the real issue just the regulators and im just wondering its like roughly what like of your size other gsifis are times to times larger i mean when i worked at the fed years ago it all must be considered de minimis right i mean its and im just trying to figure out the change we all know the change in mindset as it relates to mergers generally but im just wondering does this put you at a permanent strategic penalty box that you cant pursue any mergers or is it something unique to this deal and i know you cant talk particulars about this deal in general but can you make any broader statements like when gsifis do this or gsifis do that it gets extra scrutiny or its not as easy to get through anymore state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah mike what i would say is that the timing of our announcement in this deal in retrospect probably couldnt have come at a worst time because if you think about the regulatory agencies many of them to some extent were going through some kind of personnel change so that itself has slowed things down in some cases its driven a very significant change in philosophy whether that change in philosophy will be permanent or not i dont know id like to think not but to answer i think the nub of your question is did anything change for us beyond the regulatory situation the answer is no i mean we have for all the reasons that weve stated to you going back to september of last year we feel like the deal is strategically compelling in terms of longer term what does this mean for our position i mean again thats something that we think about and thats something that we certainly have conversations about with our primary regulator and i think theres some sympathy to all that but i dont want to talk about something in the abstract beyond the transaction that were in which is the bbh deal its not all regulators its a subset and its a situation that were going to work our way through but work our way through very cognizant of what it means for our shareholders what it means for clients et cetera mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last followup on this is there anything that you can do to help control the outcome at this time or is it simply based on the analysis by the regulators ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp well that i mean weve talked about modifications to the transaction and the modifications are meant to meet either regulatory concern or to navigate or to do what we believe is required to navigate through regulatory concerns so thats what were up to now mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you operator next well go to betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi just a couple of quick followups one i know youve had some mi charges merger integration charges over the past few quarters i mean if any of that is for the bbh deal was there anything in a walk away that you would be refunded for im guessing the answer is no but i just want to make sure i understand how that works eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 betsy its eric no those are incurred charges that are about primarily our staffing and then some of the service providers but weve also what we have done is avoided some of the obviously there are costs that are continuing on deal closing some of the advisory fees et cetera those have not played through there and those would not be incurred so those are kind of the base level expenses and theres no tail on those by and large betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right okay and is it possible to size how much of those were for or have been for bbh or not eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp since earlier this year they primarily been around the bbh transaction work betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then weve had two quarters of very strong dollar performance here dollar strengthening qonq i see it in the deck the ins and outs on the drag on revenues the benefit to expenses a little bit of a drag on the aucaum volumes youve got some benefit from volatility in the trading line so just wanted to get your sense of how has the dollar strengthening all in impacted you and how do you think about managing that risk just generally speaking thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah betsy its eric what i described to you is that the dollar has an effect as do all the currencies on our pl and balance sheet but its relatively symmetric and ill say almost neutral and i say that in ebit terms and in balance sheet terms it dollar strengthening reduces revenues but also reduces the expenses not in all currencies and all the time but it tends to have almost an ebitneutral impact on the pl and then on the balance sheet you also have a similar effect where as deposits are revalued downwards in foreign jurisdictions so the us appreciates so are the assets in those jurisdictions and so you have some symmetry so by and large its ill call it roughly neutral which is why we dont do any particular hedging on it because we find that we can manage through it in a comfortable manner except that it makes our reporting to all of you in the analyst and investment community a little more complicated but thats just what needs to happen betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and when you think about the footprint that you have today and the effort to continue to get scale in that footprint is the international exposure strategically important from a diversification perspective or do you feel that the growth outlook for the nonus markets is higher just wondering ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp betsy its ron let me take that i would say that weve got a good geographic mix now and so the way we think about it in virtually all of our locations its not like were not at minimum efficient scale but to the extent to which we can achieve more scale there wed like that i think in general the nonus markets have continued in most state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 circumstances not all to grow faster than us markets on balance if we could get a little bit more there wed like that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator and next well go to vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks sorry to beat a dead horse but going back to bbh given that you talk about buying back billion of stock the deal value was billion thats a pretty substantial percentage would you still be buying the full entity you had intended to when you announced the deal or is there some elimination of a part of it and flip it the other way could you buy just a piece of it or is it only available as a whole thing eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp vivek its eric the kind of the outlines the perimeter of the deal with brown brothers hasnt really changed its around their investment services business thats the business that were attracted to and thats the one that theyd like to transact so theres no theres not been any real change there ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yes and vivek we were never buying the whole business and there was no vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc what i meant was the whole investment services business could you buy a piece of it since its different geographies given the regulatory complexity to sort of if there are geographies that are more attractive and more difficult to replicate on your own ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah i suppose thats something we could explore vivek then the attraction goes down even more so and not clear that that accomplishes what brown brothers itself is trying to accomplish which is theyd like to exit the business not have even a smaller bit than they already have now vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ron i want to go back to a different topic you mentioned about the price increase discussions youre having and you said the operative word is understood with your clients should i interpret understood as understood and agreeing to it or understood but not necessarily open to it and shopping it around with other providers state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 18oct2022 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp so i would say again this has been highly targeted vivek so its not like weve said theres an x percent across the board kind of thing weve really tied it to one where our costs are under the most pressure and two where theres highvalue added delivered to the client and so i think you should interpret understood as we understand why youre asking for this theres certainly some talk around it and is that the right number et cetera but i would say in more cases than not but far more cases than that were getting agreement on it vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thank you operator this concludes todays questionandanswer session ill now turn the call back over to ron ohanley for any additional or closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp well thank you operator and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call operator
