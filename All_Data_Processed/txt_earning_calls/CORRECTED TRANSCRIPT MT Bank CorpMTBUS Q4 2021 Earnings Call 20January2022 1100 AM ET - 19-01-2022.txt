darren j king chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp before we get into the details of the recent quarters results id like to pause and reflect on a few highlights of the past year while the impact of the pandemic is still being felt by mt and the rest of the banking industry the turnaround in has been remarkable weve seen a transition from economic contraction and a zerobound interest rate environment to this prospect of persistent inflation and higher interest rates in against that backdrop gaap based diluted earnings per common share were compared with in up net income was billion compared with billion in the prior year improved by those results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of and respectively net operating income which excludes the after tax impact from the amortization of intangible assets as well as merger related expenses was billion up compared with billion in the prior year net operating income per diluted common share was compared with in up net operating income for expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity was and respectively we increased the common stock dividend for the fifth consecutive year to an annual rate of per share per year mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 tangible book value per share grew to at the end of up from the end of and as we build capital in anticipation of the merger with peoples united financial our cet1 ratio increased to an estimated at the end of from at the end of while the season pardon me the year had its ups and downs it sure felt like another division championship now lets turn to the results for the quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were for the fourth quarter of compared with in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of net income for the quarter was million compared with million in the linked quarter and million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis mts fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of and an annualized return on average common equity of this compares with rates of and respectively in the previous quarter included in gaap results in the recent quarter were aftertax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to million or per common share little changed from the prior quarter also included in the quarters results were mergerrelated expenses of million related to mts proposed acquisition of peoples united financial this amounted to million aftertax or per common share results for 2021s third quarter included million of such charges amounting to million aftertax or per common share consistent with our longterm practice mt provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which weve only ever excluded the aftertax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur mts net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization and mergerrelated expenses was million that compares with million in the linked quarter and million in last years fourth quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were for the recent quarter compared with in 2021s third quarter and in the fourth quarter of net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and for the recent quarter the comparable returns were and in the third quarter of in accordance with the secs guideline this mornings press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and nongaap results including tangible assets and equity included in the recent quarters gaap and net operating results was a million distribution from bayview lending group this amounted to million after tax effect and per common share we received the ph late distribution in the fourth quarter of prior to we had generally received such distributions in the first quarter of each year turning to the balance sheet and the income statement taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the fourth quarter of marking a decrease of million or from the linked quarter the primary driver of that decrease was a million decline in interest income and fees from ppp loans as that portfolio continues to decline following forgiveness of those loans by the small business administration the net interest margin decreased by basis points to that compares with in the linked quarter we estimate that the higher balance of low yielding cash on deposit at the federal reserve diluted the margin by about basis points in the quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 the lower income from ppp loans including declines in the scheduled amortization and accelerated recognition of fees from forgiven loans contributed about basis points of the margin pressure all other factors including lower benefit from hedges accounted for an estimated basis points of the decline average earning assets increased by billion compared with the third quarter this includes a billion increase in cash on deposit with the federal reserve and a million increase in investment securities on an average total loans decreased by billion or about compared with the previous quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the link quarter commercial and industrial loans declined by billion or about that reflects a billion decline in ppp loans primarily reflecting loan forgiveness our floor plan loans to vehicle dealers declined by million on an average basis but grew by million on an end of period basis all other ci loans grew about compared with the prior quarter commercial real estate loans declined million or about compared with the third quarter weve seen a higher level of pay downs and payoffs of some of the troubled loans often being refinanced by other lenders residential real estate loans declined by million or less than as a result of principal repayments as well as the ongoing repooling of loans previously purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools that was largely offset by the retention of new loans originated and held for investment consumer loans were up over reflecting growth in indirect auto loans and positive but seasonally slower growth in recreation finance loans partially offset by lower home equity lines of credit average core customer deposits which excludes cds over grew by billion or compared with the third quarter primarily reflecting noninterest bearing products turning to net interest income sorry noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the increase reflects the million distribution from bayview lending group that i previously mentioned mortgage banking revenues were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the linked quarter as we noted on the october call we have begun to retain a significant majority around of residential mortgage originations to hold for investment on the balance sheet which utilizes a portion of the excess liquidity we currently have this includes the roughly normally held for investment as a result of increasing mortgage rates and the holiday slowdown residential mortgage loan applications during the most recent quarter amounted to billion compared with billion in the third quarter of those we recorded gains on sale on the million that were locked for sale in the fourth quarter versus gain on sale on the billion that were locked in the third quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including origination and servicing activities were million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the prior quarter the decrease reflects the lower level of loans originated for sale partially offset by gains from the sale of loans previously purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools that based on borrower reperformance recently became saleable residential servicing revenues improved slightly commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled million encompassing both originations and servicing compared with million in the third quarter recall that in the third quarters commercial servicing results they included an million fee for yield maintenance as a result of prepayment of previously securitized commercial mortgage loans mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 trust income was million in the recent quarter improved from million in the previous quarter business remained solid with very strong capital markets activity continued growth in retirement plan assets and higher asset values service charges on deposits were million in the recent quarter unchanged from the third quarter heading to expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and the merger related expenses were million compared with million in the third quarter salaries and benefits increased by million from the prior quarter this reflects in part higher levels of branch staffing as customer traffic returns to normal and our ongoing program of adding onpayroll it professionals data processing and software increased by million from third quarter tied in part to higher business volumes as well as the cost from software licensing and maintenance the million linked quarter increase in advertising and marketing reflects the beginning of the winter marketing campaign combined with incentives paid on new customer accounts the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization and merger related expenses from the numerator and the securities gains or losses from the denominator was in the linked quarter compared with in the third quarter its cliché in sports that defense wins championships in banking credit is the defense lets take a look at credit while some sectors of the economy remain challenged by supply chain and labor constraints credit trends overall continue to improve even in the most severely impacted sectors the allowance for credit losses declined by million to billion at the end of the fourth quarter that reflects a million recapture of previous provisions for credit losses combined with million of net chargeoffs in the quarter at december the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding was compared with at september annualized net chargeoffs as a percentage of total loans were basis points for the fourth quarter down slightly from basis points in the third quarter with the advantage of hindsight it would appear that criticized loans did indeed peak in the third quarter of and when we file our we expect to report a noticeable decline in criticized loans reflecting both payoffs and upgrades nonaccrual loans as of december declined to billion a decrease of million from the end of september nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans outstanding were compared with at the end of the prior quarter loans days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were million at the end of the recent quarter of those loans million or are guaranteed by government related entities in a difficult environment one might argue our credit is the top ranked defense in the league turning to capital mts common equity tier ratio was an estimated as of december compared with at the end of the third quarter this reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividends paid in slightly higher risk weighted assets as previously noted we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by this quarter to per share per quarter raising the annual dividend rate to per share now turning to the outlook as we look forward into we are pleased to see that the economy is improving evidenced by the fact that gdp is growing and unemployment is falling however these conditions are driving inflation which is impacting our cost structure as well as that of our customers it has also changed the outlook for interest rates as the forward curve now has embedded a number of increases in both and our outlook considers these macro factors also as we are still awaiting regulatory approval for our merger with peoples united we will focus our comments on mt standalone that said there are no material changes to our mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 expectations for the financial impact and benefits of the merger of course timing of those benefits will depend on the date we close the merger and complete the conversion starting with the balance sheet there are a number of moving parts that will impact where were headed we dont expect the billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of to endure through were managing deposit balances both broker and customer relationships that dont make economic sense in this rate and liquidity environment wed expect interest checking and mmda accounts balance excuse me to decline over the course of the year our current plan is to continue securities purchases to increase the proportion of our liquid assets that are held in longer duration assets and have higher yields we expect to do this by replacing maturities and principal amortization and to increase investment securities by an incremental billion by the end of the year on the commercial side ppp loans on our balance sheet amounted to billion at year end we expect a significant majority of those loans will be largely repaid or forgiven in the first half of weve seen a meaningful turnaround in vehicle inventory financing and we believe were past the low point and expect growth in although not fully back to prepandemic levels the remainder of our ci portfolio experienced growth this past quarter and we believe weve also reached the inflection point in these balances we expect this growth to continue the pandemic resulted in a slow pace of new commercial real estate transactions over the past two years putting pressure on balance growth this leads us to expect low singledigit declines in cre balances in our efforts to make this portfolio more capital efficient should result in a transition to more fee income less interest income less use of the balance sheet and higher returns over time in connection with those efforts we may seek to participate cre loan exposures to thirdparties while retaining the customer relationships and loan servicing these factors are reflected in our outlook for interest and fee income as noted earlier were retaining a large majority of the mortgage loans we originate which we expect will grow balances by approximately billion in depending on the level of refinance activity offsetting that growth are billion of mortgage loans purchased from ginnie mae servicing pools on our balance sheet at the end of more than half of which we believe will qualify for repooling over the course of on average we expect the residential real estate loan portfolio will contract during we expect more of the same in the consumer portfolios with growth in indirect vehicle financing being partially offset by continued pressures on home equity balances taking all of this into account the balance headwinds from ppp and ginnie mae buyouts will lead to average balance declines in however excluding those impacts we expect aggregate loan growth to be in the low to midsingledigits we expect net interest income to be down in the low to midsingledigits on a yearoveryear basis growth in securities retention of mortgage loan originations and a return to growth in ci loans will help but not fully offset the lower benefits from the ppp loans and our interest rate hedging program we continue to expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter of the year and grow from there that should result in a net interest margin little changed from full year in the area of our forecast incorporates three increases in short term interest rates although the third increase occurs late enough in the year to not have a meaningful impact on either net interest income or margin mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 turning to fees as we noted residential mortgage gain on sale revenues will be diminished in by our programs to retain for investment a large portion of originations although repooling of ginnie mae buyouts should be a partial offset commercial originations and servicing as well as residential mortgage servicing should still be solid we see continued momentum in trust income based on the capital markets activity continued growth in retirement plan assets and possibly higher asset values we would need to see short term interest rates rise by to basis points before we can fully recover the money fund fees we are currently waiving those amount to an annual run rate of approximately million we expect service charges on deposit accounts to be down with modest growth in commercial offset by declines in consumer largely related to changes in our overdraft practices all in were looking for low singledigit growth in noninterest revenues in turning to expenses noninterest operating expenses in grew at an uncharacteristically high rate rising over prior years lower profitability and growth led to decreased compensation costs in the recovery and profitability in carried with it a return to more normal compensation costs which accounted for over half of the increase our current estimate contemplates low to midsingledigit operating expense growth in and like salaries and benefits data processing and software and advertising are the categories that will drive the majority of the increase we would expect to see our typical seasonal surge in compensation expense during the years first quarter that amount last year was approximately million and were encouraged by the improvement in credit conditions over the past several quarters overall we expect net chargeoffs to be consistent with the average of the past two years although it could be somewhat lumpy from quartertoquarter we expect loss provisioning to normalize as loan growth offsets potential decline in troubled credits lastly turning to capital weve paused our buyback program while we wait to close the merger with peoples united since that pause our cet1 ratio has increased by basis points to leaving us positioned well in excess of what we believe we need to run the combined company our focus as always will be on deploying the excess capital we have beyond that needed to support growth in the business of course as youre aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now lets open up the call to questions before which britney will briefly review the instructions mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions and we will take our first question from john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi don i wish you all the best in retirement and darren nice division championship comments you made in your prepared remarks all the best of luck to your bills or to the bills and although im an andy reid fan so darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good luck to you this weekend and we appreciate the comments john pancari q analyst evercore isi well im an andy reid fan but not the chiefs per se darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp okay john pancari q analyst evercore isi but anyway on the deposit topic i know you mentioned that checking balances and money market are likely to decline what is your overall deposit growth assumption as you look at and then related to that what are your deposit beta assumptions baked in and maybe if you could talk about the sensitivities to basis point rate hike thanks darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah so i guess ill start with the latter when we look at where we are with rates and the first set of increases our expectation is that the reactivity early on is really low and that for the first probably basis points of increase the net interest margin would increase to basis points for each of the first and then well go from there mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 when we look at the balance growth that we expect over the course of the year were really anticipating that much of the cash that we have on hand will start to deploy or move off there are some escrow balances that are tied to the index that we expect will run off in the first part of the year and when you look at the brokered money market balances those have a term on them and we expect those to decrease when you look at kind of the core balances on the balance sheet were really expecting fairly modest decreases over the course of the year theres the usual uptick in commercial balances that you see at the end of the year thats part of what we saw in the fourth quarter where our middle market and business customers hold on to or build up their balances for distributions that usually happen in january and february we also saw an uptick again in the fourth quarter in trust demand balances which really reflect activity in the ma markets and the agency business and so those should start to come down a little bit but at the moment were really not anticipating meaningful rundown in our core operating account balances for john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thats helpful thank you and then separately on the peoples deal i know you mentioned that your forecast related to the deal remain unchanged anything else you can comment on in terms of the expected timing around the closure of the deal weve seen the bottleneck of delayed deals begin to clear here and so i would darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah its were kind of in the same boat we were in the fourth quarter john where we were pleased to see the as youve noted the bottleneck clear and that things are happening and were hopeful that well receive positive news here in the first quarter operator and we will take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning guys hey i wanted to just follow up on your comments about that excess liquidity position and the securities i think theres a perception that you might have gotten more aggressive i heard you just say that youre only expecting to build the book by about billion over runoff and i guess can you just give us updated thoughts on how youre looking at the mix of earning assets presuming that those deposits do shrink and with kind of an in and out as you mentioned in your loan growth guide how you just expect for the overall composition of the book to look from like a loans or earning assets perspective thanks darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure theres a lot to unpack in the question ken so just starting with the cash and the securities if you think about uses of the cash theres two that weve been looking at one is retaining our mortgage production and thats a way to get some duration and some yield and so were taking that on the balance sheet instead of in the securities portfolio in mbs mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 and when you look in the securities portfolio over the last quarter weve kind of shifted a little bit to shorter duration treasuries kind of two to three years as the curve reshaped and so well continue to build that portfolio but were being patient because we see where rates are headed and so were trying to trade off the incremental spread that you can get by putting more securities on the books with the downside of the marktomarket risk that goes through your oci and affects your tangible book value and so thats whats on our mind as we look through those balances the other thing to keep in mind as we talk about the brokered money markets and cds coming off that will be a use of some of that cash and we also expect to see some use with peoples when the two banks come together and so the cash were watching it closely we dont love having such excess balances that dont earn much but at the same token we want to make sure were careful with how we start to deploy it when you look at the balance sheet and the earning assets in total so given that decrease in cash that would be the largest driver of a decrease in earning assets in our forecast of over but doesnt have as meaningful an impact on nii obviously because theyre very low margin when i look underneath and what i get excited about looking into is that across all of our portfolios holding the specials which ill get to in a second aside whether its ci whether its residential mortgage or whether its consumer were expecting growth in those portfolios and we do expect a decrease a slight decrease in the cre portfolio over the course of the year for the reasons that weve talked about as we both reshape our gotomarket strategy there so that we can actually provide better service to our clients as well as just the normal course of construction loans paying down and reaching their end and so when you take that which is the core of the bank its actually low to midsingledigit growth in those portfolios what i would refer to or i refer to as the specials one is the ppp loans and so when you look at those on an average basis in they averaged about billion and that average in is down to about billion and so thats got a meaningful impact on the printed loan growth and then the same thing with the ginnie mae buyouts where on average basis in they were around billion and we think as those repool and we put them back into the servicing portfolio and do the gain on sale that those drop to about billion and so when you when you look at on average so when you look at the what i would refer to as the specials you kind of see a decrease in those balances but thats the things that have happened over the course of over and and so as we exit we start to have a more contemporary balance sheet that starts to skew a little bit more towards ci and a little less cash on the balance sheet which overall should start to see the margin increase and allow us to benefit from the rising rate environment ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it that was a complicated question and great answer so ill leave it at that thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp thanks ken mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 operator and we will take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi darren darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc im with you a strong defense does win the big games but when youre behind you have to have a hurryup offense so with that in mind and your capital levels being so high how aggressive can you be after the peoples deal in buying back your stock or using that excess capital to bring that cet1 ratio down to a more normal level darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well gerard thats a good question we could debate whether capital is offense or defense but certainly to your point holding cet1 which i think will post quite high relative to the peers when were finished with the year is a higher level of capital than obviously we believe we need to run the combined organization given the credit emphasis of both of those organizations when you look at peoples history of strong underwriting and you look at how our results have held up over the course of the last couple years and the improvements were seeing in the portfolio we definitely see an opportunity to bring that down and we will look to bring those ratios down over the course of where the actual target and how fast well get down there will be will kind of be dependent on when we close and convert the merger but as you think about targets of where wed like to be and think about where we were kind of prepandemic thats a good place to think about where we might end up over the course of the next six quarters or something like that once you get through the deal gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you touched on credit quality obviously your net chargeoffs are remarkably low similar to some others in the industry but thats a hallmark for you folks then can you share with us what you said about being taken out on some of the classified loans by competitors what were the flows in and out of the nonperformers especially with the hotel loans and the hospitality and leisure industry darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yes happy to well youll see the full print when we put the 10k out but if you look at where the decrease was over the quarter was predominantly in the hotel and retail space and when you look at the hotel portfolio what were seeing is were seeing a couple things were seeing upgrades because when we look at our at the activity thats happening in the hotel space when you get to resort oriented hotels or ones that are more suburban and drive up weve seen occupancy rates come back and being very strong mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 theres still some challenges in the larger city hotels as business travel isnt quite back to where it was but theyre off their pandemic lows and then some of the when we look at some of the properties that have been refinanced by others no matter what class it is what were finding is there are other institutions that are coming in and offering terms that might be interestonly for one or two years and not fully amortizing which for many of these properties is a very attractive alternative whats kind of interesting about it is if we were to restructure those loans to a similar thing similar setup it would be a troubled debt restructure for us but for someone else its a new loan and so its one of those things where i guess id rather have a payoff than a chargeoff and so thats part of whats helping bring down both the criticized and the nonaccruals gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and don good luck in retirement and if youre ever in boston in november for the baab conference youre always welcome don so thank you donald macleod a administrative vice president directorinvestor relations mt bank corp thank you operator and we will take our next question from christopher spahr with wells fargo your line is now open christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you good afternoon so my question is just now that youre kind of getting under the hood with peoples i mean you took a merger charge this quarter is there anything thats going to surprise you on the upside and also on a related note peoples has a larger share of securities as a percent of earning assets much larger than what you have on your balance sheet is that kind of why youre a little bit more cautious in adding more securities on your own portfolio darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp excellent question and observation chris thats definitely one of the things that is on our mind as we think about the securities portfolio not just the size of it but the composition of it now if you look within the peoples portfolio theres a large municipal bond portfolio there which gives you a little bit different duration and composition and so as we think about the cash that we have and how we want to build up our securities portfolio were taking that into account as i mentioned before were also taking into account some of the other funding sources that peoples has on their balance sheet that we would be able to reduce that funding and lower our overall cost of funding with the cash balances that we have obviously were all in the same banking industry so theyre still also seeing some cash balances grow as well and are looking to deploy them but thats absolutely part of our thought process and patience on putting that cash to work and i guess as weve gone through the merger preparation process we just continued to be excited by the combination of the two organizations the cultures between the two couldnt be more similar the focus on clients mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 and the focus on geographies the opportunity to have complementary products that is encouraging and were just between both organizations anxious to be able to go to market as one unified team because everyone can see the potential is there anything really new from what we saw going in the answer is probably no we continue to be excited about the opportunity to grow the small business segment within the peoples portfolio and bring some of our treasury management into the ci space were both pretty solid at commercial real estate when you look at what we have from peoples theres some unique segments that they serve that we can bring to our client base their leasing equipment finance small ticket leasing some of the fund lending as well as some of the niche businesses they have like the mortgage warehouse lending and so we think the combination were still excited about it theyre very complementary we love the funding deposit franchise that they have and so no real big upsides in terms of new things but certainly continued enthusiasm for what we saw back almost a year ago christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if i could just one quick followup how quickly can you close the deal say if the merger is approved tomorrow how quickly can you close it and start integration process thank you darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure so by law theres a 15day cool off period once the approval is granted and so technically days is your fastest usually youre within that time period plus or minus a week depending on trying to manage things like month ends and quarter ends and the like but thats kind of generally the timeframe and then once thats done then you try to lock down a time to do your system conversion and so the complicating factor there is when youre merging with an organization that has a number of outside contracts and outsourcing where some of their technology is provided by third party you got to coordinate with that third party to make that happen and so we think its probably in the order of to days post legal close that you can do the system conversion and then you probably try and time it around a long weekend to the extent that you can just because it helps derisk that system integration but obviously our mutual desire is for a quick close and as quickly as possible a conversion so that we can get on to the things that i mentioned before talking to customers and driving business operator and we will take our next question from dave rochester with compass point your line is now open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc quick one on the loan side it sounded like the floor plan segment was really strong this quarter can you just give an update on the dynamics youre seeing in that market and what your outlook is there it sounds like maybe you have some more momentum there so just curious what youre hearing from customers and how much you expect that to contribute to loan growth this year darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure yeah and on an end of period basis we saw the floor plan loans up just over million which typically you would see an uptick in the fourth quarter there is a pattern to that business that you see balances built in the fourth quarter and a little bit into the first and then as those inventories get sold and ultimately the dealers clear out their lots of one model a year to prepare for the next you see a decrease in the third quarter and so that pattern had shifted a little bit for the last months i would say and its mainly been a decrease so we were pleased to see some balances come back and its really about the level of production and so if you looked from a dealers perspective they love the current situation where the inventory is low and both time on lot is low thats very helpful for their profitability but you see the manufacturers ramp up and thats what was reflected in our auto floor plan growth we expect that ramp up to continue the sar last year in was the lowest its been in a while at million million or million million vehicle level i think we got as high as million million prepandemic and so well see that start to come back one of the things that youre seeing in the dealers is the shift to electric and so i think theres some changeover that youre seeing thats compromising that volume in the shortterm and so our expectation for floor plan over the course of the year is that well see balances and utilization rates tick up not all the way back to what they were prepandemic but maybe twothirds of the way back in and then the rest of the way back in excuse me about half of the way back in of the way back in and then by the time we get to the start of youre probably back to where you were prepandemic and its just going through that change within the manufacturing world that will drive the pace of inventory buildup at the dealers but long story short its a positive thing to see those volumes going its good for clients and good for the economy david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah sounds good so youve definitely hit the inflection point there on that thats great darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and maybe just a real quick one on deal timing i know youre really limited as to what you can say and appreciate the color youve given so far i was just curious if youre still kind of getting requests for information or in an info exchange or whatever with the regulators or if that process is completed and you are just waiting on an answer at this point mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah its what i would describe as by and large the normal process with back and forth with questions and whats abnormal obviously is the time and some of the things that are happening around washington and were just got our fingers crossed and were waiting to solve it fingers crossed indiscernible more dire than it is i think its just being patient that while washington gets through the backlog and the optimist is that its happening right we saw some deals get approved and we expect it to continue david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yes sounds good one last one on the securities purchases appreciated all the color you gave there was just wondering if theres any kind of sensitivity around as it relates to the steepness of the curve so if we were to see a more material steepening than you guys are looking for if maybe that could make you more comfortable with picking up some more volume there and sorry if i missed the bit can you talk about what your expectation is at this point for the long end of the curve that youve got baked into your nii and margin estimates thatd be great darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp sure weve got obviously a lot of liquidity to put to work and when we think about the securities portfolio the steepness helps what we will probably pay a little bit more attention to is not just the steepness but where the short end is when we look at some of the cash weve been deploying weve been deploying it in mortgages as i mentioned through the balance sheet as opposed to through the securities portfolio and so instead of having mbs were actually putting mortgages on the balance sheet and getting some duration in yield that way and so on the securities portfolio weve tended to skew a little bit recently towards the shorter end of the curve so kind of in the two to threeyear space and so thats really where weve been watching and looking and one of the things that well pay attention to from a shape of the curve perspective is where the forward rates are and if we start to see the forward rates move one of the other ways that well start to try and take some of that assets sensitivity off the table maybe it will be through the hedging program and restarting the hedging program depending on what we see there so theres a lot of different avenues that were thinking about both to protect and grow net interest income as well as to put the cash to work and its just thinking through all the alternatives not just mt but the combined mt with peoples and managing the assets sensitivity across the balance sheet the securities portfolio and hedging and making sure that were getting maximizing yield without over hedging at the same time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah all right great appreciate the color and don congrats on a great career at mt great working with you donald macleod a administrative vice president directorinvestor relations mt bank corp thanks mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 operator and well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just want to circle back on the loan growth i think you mentioned cre balances low singledigits in im just if you dont mind talk to us in terms of if you look beyond is it possible that this portfolio remains a drag on overall loan growth as you move towards the feedriven strategy and give us an update in terms of the growth market on the fee side how quickly will that start hitting the ground running by then you should see the revenue impact from it darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i think as it relates to the cre portfolio the way to think about it is the decrease in balances will be consistent but slow and what were looking to do is more on a prospective basis as we work with our existing clients as well as new ones and were helping them finance their properties that well look to use a mix of both our balance sheet as well as the balance sheet of others and so what will happen is the rate of growth our new originations will slow and that will be what drives the decline because theres normal amortization and theres normal payoffs that happen but obviously as we make that shift then well start to grow the fees and the fee income will come they will probably lag slightly the net interest income but the flip side of that is that it reduces the capital required to support that and so that allows us to both improve the economics of the individual deals but then to manage our balance sheet and manage our equity levels and either deploy it into other high yielding customer segments and asset types or to deploy it back to shareholders and so when we think about it from a eps perspective and return perspective while the balances might decline it is in our opinion additive to returns and additive to eps ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and is it additive to eps today or is it a year out by the time we get there darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp itll be a year before that stuff starts to happen and itll grow as we go through and mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just a second question on loan growth around retention of mortgages is there a certain level that youre targeting in terms of how big that book can get relative to the overall portfolio just give us your thought process on when you may make the pivot again retention versus selling some of that production darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i guess as we look forward i think its safe to say that for well be retaining most of those mortgages and perhaps into well look at where gain on sale margins are and what constraints if any the mortgages are putting on the balance sheet well think about whether or not we want to hold mbs in the future instead of having the mortgages on the balance sheet as rates move up then you start to reduce some of that convexity risk that sits in the mbs portfolio and we might think about shifting some of the balances there as well if you went back and looked at our balance sheet through time you would see that the mortgage balances peaked when we acquired hudson city and we came down from there so that would probably be the upper bound i dont think wed get to that level but overall our objective is to maintain a diversified balance sheet across geographies and customer segments and asset classes and so the mortgage portfolio got a little bit smaller through the course of the last few years and well look to build it back up where the ending point is again well come back with a little bit more detail there the reason im not giving a specific target is hudson city has mortgages on their balance sheet as well and when we put the two organizations together sorry peoples indiscernible on my mind im sorry im having ptsd when we combine with peoples they also have mortgages on their balance sheet so again like we talked about with the securities portfolio were thinking about not just what we look like by ourselves but what the combined organization and balance sheet might look like so were taking that into account as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks and don congratulations and good luck donald macleod a administrative vice president directorinvestor relations mt bank corp thanks operator and we will take our next question from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon just wanted to ask a few follow up questions darren on the to basis point of nim sensitivity to each i just wanted to make sure i heard it right that includes the ramp in terms of deposit repricing that you experienced in the first and is that to basis points on a static balance sheet or a dynamic balance sheet mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp good question it is on a dynamic balance sheet and its to basis points per for the first erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc right sorry yes yes and so whats the deposit beta underneath the to basis points for darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well it depends and thats why we got the range theres some part of the deposits that are pegged to the index and so if its just those that move then youre down in kind of a to range of deposit reactivity if it happens to get all the way up to to then you would get to the lower end of that range but i think we believe much like others that with all the excess deposits in the system and excess liquidity that the reactivity at least for the first few hikes with the exception of those that are tied to an index will be pretty low erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and darren the stock did turn when you gave your guidance for expenses being up low to midsingle digits on a standalone basis and if we want to take the football analogy further in a to i guess how much is offense versus defense right in terms of how much are you pulling forward some investment spend versus the cost inflationary catch up and you said was not a normal rate of growth for expenses for mt is to the new normal or low to midsingle digits the new normal darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp well i guess ill start with its hard to say what the new normal is given the inflationary environment were in if we step back and we give context if you look at our expense growth compound annual growth rate over the last two years its actually under i think its about or and so what happened was when we took the actions we did in to adjust some of our expenses given the environment we were operating in most notably compensation that we actually had a decrease in compared to most others who had an increase and so it came back in or excuse me and so when you look over the course of the average over those two years were talking expense growth which in this inflation environment is pretty good and pretty consistent with mts longterm average and so when we think about in the to theres a couple things going on there one is just when you look at the changes that happened over the course of and where we ended the year its annualizing the run rate of the fourth quarter bakes in some growth just by itself and then on top of that as we mentioned we start to come back to a more normal environment and we see advertising and promotion expenses come back closer to what they were prepandemic although not all the way back and then as we talk about investments the software and outside data processing i mean outside data processing is largely tied to volume and so as we see fee income growth were going to see expense growth and a lot of the software licensing and maintenance as we continue to make our investments in the franchise and we shift more to buying software rather than developing it ourselves and using the cloud that you see some of those expenses move up mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 and obviously as we make those investments they will have countervailing impacts on other parts of the organization notably in professional services and salary and benefits costs but therell be a timing mismatch and so those should help us moderate expense growth in the forward years but some of it is just the timing of when these changes occurred in and then their full year impact in operator and we will take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i want to come back to the balance sheet and i know youve touched on a lot of these pieces but im sitting here and im hearing deposits down the only bank i cover where theyre talking about deposits down loans down securities not really growing after you shrank it kind of and i get it right like youre the best bank at ppp relative to your size so it could be a drag you probably had the most ginnie mae buyouts which is very profitable relative to your size but it just doesnt feel right kind of where we are in the economy and i guess i come back and wonder like are you missing some things on the loan origination side right like a lot of your peers have gotten in the capital markets which create some large corporate opportunities in the lending side theyve acquired pointofsale im not sure how economically attractive all these things are but like theyre doing things to improve their asset generation and i know youve been very conservative in the past you talked about playing defense and you tend to do extremely well kind of in the credit cycle but im just wondering is there something more thats needed on the asset generation side if we get this multiyear recovery that many people think well get darren j king a chief financial officer executive vice president mt bank corp yeah i appreciate the clarification well go back through some of the categories when we look at the ci portfolio and our expected growth rate there which would include what we talked about in the floor plan business as well as other ci were actually expecting growth in on an average and endofperiod basis thats low doubledigits when we look at residential mortgage growth as we retain the balances on an average basis we think thats mid singledigit growth and the consumer business is up upper singledigits the only one portfolio where theres some decreases is the cre portfolio and thats for all the reasons weve talked about when you put all those together youve got kind of midsingledigit growth in the core portfolio which i think is consistent with what were seeing and how were thinking about the world and taking advantage of the growth thats out there its the size of the ppp and how well we did in and that is affecting the average and the total and then the other piece is the ginnie maes but outside of those things were seeing the growth that youre talking about when you talk about deposits the core deposits and the core operating accounts of our customers were not expecting material decreases its some of the deposits where theyre tied to an index and they would not be what we can consider core operating accounts that were anticipating some decline and whether thats the brokered money market and brokered cds as well as escrow balances and so were just continuing to look to optimize those balances and deploy that excess cash in a way that is additive to clients without and being shareholder friendly and so i guess when i look forward at you make it sound dire actually i feel as optimistic as ive been in the last months about the prospects for all the reasons that you talked about its just the its a little bit difficult mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 with some of the moving parts on the balance sheet but when i look forward at what weve got in front of us whether its deploying the excess cash its growing the assets as we talked about deploying the excess capital theres a number of opportunities and options that we have in front of us to continue to grow the bank and make and beyond the same mt that were used to seeing and so its just getting through some of these transitions that are happening on the balance sheet but underneath i think things look really good operator and we currently have no further questions on the line at this time i will turn the program back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks brian klock
