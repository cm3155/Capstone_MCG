your questions in the fourth quarter of we reported net income of million and earnings per share of exclusive of charges for debt extinguishment and severance adjusted net income was million for the second consecutive quarter this represents the highest level of quarterly earnings in valleys entire history our adjusted net income of million was higher than despite million increase in our provision despite a challenging backdrop these exceptional financial results were achieved through the execution of our strategic priorities as we became more efficient diversified our revenue mix and generated substantial core deposit growth i am optimistic that last years macro challenges are beginning to abate and our strategic focus on positive operating leverage and growth will position us for future success in with regard to the macro environment a more comprehensive vaccine rollout is on the horizon which will improve the economic outlook and present new growth opportunities for us with this backdrop we expect to achieve mid singledigit loan growth in exclusive of the effects of ppp the yield curve has also steepened meaningfully in recent months driving an increase in our loan origination yields we continue to believe that we will outperform many of our peers from a net interest margin perspective in despite ongoing economic pressure from the pandemic our credit trends remained strong in inclusive of loans modified under the cares act active deferrals were only of loans at and nonaccrual loans were only of total loans our net chargeoffs were a mere basis points of average loans in the fourth quarter our underwriting discipline and credit strength support our below peer allowance for credit losses which stands at of loans excluding ppp we are confident in our underwriting philosophy and the performance of our borrowers and are wellpositioned to manage the after effects of the pandemic from a credit perspective this improving backdrop sets the stage for another strong year in i want to spend some time this morning discussing how our relationshipbased value proposition and technology strategy will help us drive improved operating leverage and strong organic growth in and beyond as you know covid19 has amplified the role of technology in the banking industry valley has been well ahead of this trend and our experience in reinforces the emphasis that we have placed on building bestinclass technology solutions over the last few years while the industry has concentrated on frontend applications we are hyperfocused on enhancing our back office technology as well this unique approach will ensure that we have the infrastructure and agility to support the evolving needs of our customers and to execute on our growth initiatives our success in ppp is a great example of why our differentiated strategy is so important in the early days of the program we quickly stood up an internally developed endtoend digital process built on our own technology infrastructure our ability to execute and originate billion of ppp loans was a direct result of our technology valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 strategy and the agile infrastructure we are building ppp also highlighted how we use technology to support not replace the human element of banking each ppp borrower was supported by a valley banker throughout this process valley has always been a relationshipfocused banking institution our customers value thoughtful advice from our knowledgeable bankers our differentiated hightouch service and the comprehensive suite of financial solutions that we provide this customerfocused value proposition supported by technology will help us attract new clients and drive growth going forward our

diverse financial needs of our customers we are building a highperforming agile organization with a strong corporate culture this will allow our organization to continue to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and will drive future success for all of our stakeholders i couldnt be more proud of what our team has accomplished todate and couldnt be more excited for what the future holds for valley with that id like to turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some additional financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide you can see that valleys reported net interest margin increased to from in the third quarter of on a sequential basis our cost of interestbearing liabilities improved by basis points to total interest expense declined by approximately from the prior quarter and is down from the fourth quarter of this reflects continued reductions in interestbearing deposit cost and the significant nonmaturity deposit growth that we have experienced in recent quarters earning asset yields declined basis points as higheryielding loans continue to repay this repayment was partially offset by higher prepayment fees and ppp forgiveness income compared to the third quarter our cash balance continued to increase in the quarter as a result of strong deposit inflows we estimate that additional cash weighed on our asset yield by basis points as compared to the third quarter in middecember we deployed excess liquidity to repay million of higher cost fhlb advances these borrowings carried an average cost of and the majority were set to mature in the third quarter of all else equal we estimate this action would add basis points to our future net interest margin you can see more detail regarding the impacts of ppp income on slide we estimate that ppp income contributed basis point to the margin during the quarter the sequential increase in ppp revenue is due to the accelerated forgiveness of approximately million of ppp loans during the quarter today we have recognized ppp fees of million an additional million of fees related to phase and originations will be recognized as remaining loans are forgiven or repaid as you are aware the sba recently rolled out phase of ppp we are now encouraged again with origination volumes that our colleagues are processing in support of our local businesses valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 slide outlines our interest rate positioning and the remaining opportunity to reprice liabilities lower in over the next three quarters we have over billion of retail cds maturing at an average cost above basis points currently our highest cd offering rate is basis points for five years there are additional opportunities to reprice borrowings and brokered cds lower as well to this point weve been able to protect our net interest margin through funding cost reductions as a result of our repricing and liquidity deployment levers we continue to believe that we will outperform peers from a net interest margin perspective going forward slide illustrates the significant improvement in our funding profile that we achieved in total deposits increased more than driven by a increase in noninterestbearing deposits and a increase in interestbearing transaction accounts cd balances declined in the year this transformation is the result of both valuespecific efforts particularly with regards to crossselling new ppp customers and an industrywide liquidity increase we will work hard to preserve this mix shift going forward the bottom left chart illustrates the significant downward trend in our interestbearing deposit costs over the last few quarters in the fourth quarter our average cost of deposits was a mere basis points this is valleys lowest quarterly deposit cost in at least the last years given this already low starting point deposit cost reductions beyond the cd repricing opportunity identified earlier are likely to be more incremental going forward one side effect of our recent deposit growth is continually elevated levels of liquidity our cash balance increased to billion from billion in the third quarter this occurred despite our utilization of nearly million of excess liquidity to prepay fhlb advances as mentioned earlier as we strive to optimize our liquidity and our earnings we will continue to evaluate additional deployment opportunities on both sides of the balance sheet slide details our loan portfolio and origination trends over the last few quarters despite higher loan fees and the previously mentioned ppp forgiveness average loan yields declined basis points in the quarter on the positive side our average origination rate increased basis points from the third quarter the steeper curve has also expanded loan spreads which reached their widest levels since the first quarter of excluding ppp total loans declined slightly during the quarter we generated billion of new loans in the quarter up nearly from the third quarter and on par with prepandemic levels on the commercial side strong originations were offset by the repayment of two large loans totaling approximately million where the borrowers businesses were sold we also saw stability in our consumer portfolios which increased for the first time in four quarters our pipelines remain robust and organic growth opportunities have returned to prepandemic levels while activity has rebounded across our markets we are particularly excited by opportunities in florida where we are dedicating additional resources to meet the increased demand slide illustrates the improvement in our loan deferral since the onset of the pandemic at the end of the fourth quarter total deferrals had declined to million or just over of our loan portfolio loan deferrals in our covidexposed portfolios stand at down from in the third quarter as a reminder the majority of our commercial deferrals remain current with regards to interest payments moving to slide our noninterest income declined from the third quarter swap fees declined to million while deposit service charges and gain on sale income both improved net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased approximately sequentially reflecting gain on sale margin expansion residential valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 loans sold were effectively in line with the third quarter at million while the gain on sale margin increased over basis points to for the year adjusted noninterest income increased over and comprised of our revenue we recognize that certain fee lines will ebb and flow with market conditions however we remain focused on growing diverse revenue streams and building differentiated businesses that our customers will value to that end we recently announced the hiring of a municipal investment strategy team to further diversify our capital markets and correspondent banking businesses slide illustrates our expense trends throughout the year our fourth quarter results included nearly million of pretax debt extinguishment and severance charges these charges reflect efforts to improve our positioning for adjusted expenses increased in the fourth quarter partially related to a million asset impairment charge and elevated telecom expenses we expect both of these items to normalize going forward for the year our adjusted efficiency ratio was down from in and well below our target on a yearoveryear basis we generated revenue growth against an increase in adjusted operating expenses looking forward we acknowledge that industrywide revenue headwinds are likely to build on the expense side easily identified excess costs have been largely rationalized we have a modest tailwind from the branch closures that we mentioned last quarter and which occurred in december our team is hard at work identifying additional process improvements that can help us preserve the strong operating leverage momentum that we have established turning to slide you can see our credit trends in the last five quarters notably on the top right nonaccruals declined to of loans from in the third quarter the sequential improvement was primarily driven by the ci portfolio net chargeoffs declined to million representing the lowest level since the third quarter of this equated to just basis points of loans versus basis points in the prior quarter despite the extremely low level of chargeoffs our allowance for credit losses increased to of loans from we remain optimistic on our outlook for credit performance the quarters reserve build is related to a few specific factors first we revised our new york city taxi medallion valuation to from which contributed to our specific reserve we also downgraded certain commercial credits in covidexposed industries including hospitality retail and dining weve been very selective lending to these industries and have focused on established borrowers with substantial liquidity and diverse sources of cash flow while the properties in these specific industries warranted downgrades we remain confident in the overall performance of these borrowers valleys credit strength has long been a distinguishing characteristic of our organization our loss rates have historically lagged peers which has enabled us to carry a below average reserve while continued economic uncertainty contributed to our modest reserve build this quarter we still expect to outperform the industry on credit loss experience in any economic environment slide illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the ongoing improvement in our capital ratios tangible book value has increased in the last months driven by our increased earnings power our tangible common equity ratio increased to from in the third quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 we estimate that our billion of ppp loans reduced our tce to total asset ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter on a yearoveryear basis we have also seen a significant improvement in our regulatory capital ratios we remain comfortable with our capital levels and believe that the consistent growth in our risk based ratios illustrate our improving ability to increase our capital levels on an organic basis with that ill turn the call back over to ira for some closing commentary ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks mike i am extremely proud of the commitment and hard work of our team that contributed to valleys financial results and strategic achievements we are very excited about the opportunities that will offer and look forward to executing on our strategic priorities and driving continued success with that id now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of frank schiraldi from piper sandler you may begin frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp hey frank michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just on first question was on ph a loan you talked about the loan pipelines having rebuilt to pre covid levels and the midsingledigit growth and mike you also mentioned florida as the greater opportunity within that just wondering if you can speak to a little more color on is it sort of florida could be a high single digit growth and up north could be low single digits and then any expected change in mix in terms of loan type thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah hey frank its tom iadanza yeah the production of pipeline increased and respectively from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as mike pointed out returning us to the prepandemic levels florida valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 represents of our production today up from probably a year ago and we also experienced slightly better margins in the florida market our business in new york new jersey remained steady the pipelines continue to grow across the regions and across all different types of loans that were involved in between ci and cre our business is primarily in the suburban markets not a big reliance on the manhattan market but following our success and our growth in florida weve begun adding ci teams and were looking to increase the ci staff in florida by and weve already begun adding those people florida today represents about of our commercial portfolio we expect that to grow we expect ci to complement our already strong real estate business but we expect growth in new york new jersey to continue on the same pace it has in the past also well be adding a team of experienced ci lenders in the philadelphia market at some point during this year were actively recruiting two years ago we moved into philly with real estate lenders weve had great success it complements what we do up here the attributes of the market are very similar to the new jersey market and its contiguous and much easier for us to manage so we do expect that singledigit growth to occur this year florida will be an important component as it always has been but we get steady growth in all our markets frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and ph now if i could just sneak in one more on fee income initiatives and just thinking about the next couple of years i guess i mean noninterest income to revenues i guess could that ratio just given the strong year in could that ratio growing be more of sort of a or result just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah this is mike keep in mind that fee income as a percent of total revenue is taking a little bit of a hit because weve had such great success with net interest income and so its probably stronger than it looks on a percent of revenue basis just because of that but our commitment to either starting new businesses adding to what we already do in the fee income space which shouldnt get lost in the equation thats definitely part of what were doing one of our strategic priorities over the coming years is to increase that percentage that fees represent of total revenue and i think the comment that i made regarding the municipal business we started in the fourth quarter shows and demonstrates our commitment to do that frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos from jpmorgan you may begin valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everybody ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start first on the efficiency ratio so youre well below the target for now that youre well below that whats the target for and moving forward more general ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp we really havent given a specific target as to where we think were going to move the organization i think youve seen significant positive operating leverage we think theres still leverage that we can pull steve based on improvements and how we outline technology throughout the entire organization we continue down the path of looking at efficiencies across the entire branch platform and we think theres a lot of opportunities within the organization getting to a stronger efficiency ratio we think is going to be important as we continue to lever and grow the organization as mike mentioned there is definite headwinds coming within the interest rate environment and we think we have a good opportunity to really mitigate some of those headwinds based on what we do on the efficiency side michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and without giving a number as we look forward one of the things we enjoy today is our efficiency ratio is a differentiator for us visàvis our peers that is something that we expect to be continue to produce and we believe that thats actually really important to our future strategic success as you look at whats going on in the industry steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so if we look at another way so if we look at the pretax preprovision roa which you called it on slide wed have to back out the ppp program impact so lets say we do that which i think we could do with the numbers you gave us so apples to apples how should we think about that trending through given the headwinds youre talking about ira ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp look i think we looked at that obviously theres some headwinds when you think about the ppp income coming off as you identified we think thats still going to be strong for the first half of i think mortgage volume could potentially go down as well based on where we see interest rate environment valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 but we have a lot a lot going on within the organization when we think about the organic growth as tom mentioned were expanding our lending staff in the florida footprint we are going down to philadelphia as well with a more concerted effort and we think that we can manage the expense base to not really see significant increase as a result of these strategic initiatives so we think theres a lot of opportunity within the organization to really drive revenue growth throughout the entire footprint and we think that will have a positive impact as to how we think about the efficiency ratio as we move forward largely a function of what were doing on the revenue side and we think we have the capacity based on the operating leverage and not really have to increase expenses steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp if you just look at the steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp indiscernible that real quickly if you just look at the lending side i would direct your attention to slide one of the things were most or encouraged by is the fact that our total loan book only went down basis points and our net originations for the quarter were up basis points im not saying thats necessarily the ongoing run rate but its definitely encouraging and were not seeing remarkable reductions in loans at least on the portfolio as it sits right now and as i said the new originations are higher when you flip to the liability side of the balance sheet one of the things thats going to help us on ppp is going to be the continued improvement that we have an opportunity to reprice our liability sources considerably lower with billion in the next roughly three quarters at over bps i would expect that those would all come on at least less than half of where theyre coming off right now when they mature steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful so for my final question i wanted to ask you a big picture question so you guys had announced a fairly bold initiative and intended transformation of the franchise as part of lift but it was really when you took over the ceo role can you give us a sense where is the company now right the new valley are you where you need to be from a client satisfaction view are you still working to change the culture are you still heavily investing in the franchise where are we in this transformation thanks ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 thank you and i think we made significant progress i think from where we were to where were headed the investment in technology has been significant and youve seen that investment in technology without bringing up the overall expenses within the organization so i think weve done a really good job of managing that investment there is a tremendous amount of opportunity still left when we think about what that technology investment has and what the positive operating leverage is the culture within the organization is something ive never seen before in my years here and i think is enviable to many outsiders we are a destination without question for bankers looking to come to an organization that has consistency that has empowerment and that really drives agility as to how we think about moving forward technology is going to continue to change and bankings going to continue to change i think three years ago we started to talk about technology and everyone looked at technology and said okay we need a new front end or we need a new way to interact with our customers and we sat there and said wait technology is all about the infrastructure and the agility and we started to invest in the infrastructure not an individual core not a front end technology when it comes to a treasury or what type of infrastructure we had to enable to have plug and play technology that enabled us to really be relevant as the environment changes and then we think about just even what you think about from a physical transformation today and everyone is looking at covid and saying wow we need to now begin to rethink what our workspace looks like years ago we sold our corporate office buildings here and we began to think about at that point that the physical environment was going to change over the last five years weve closed over branches with an understanding that delivery channels were changing we didnt need covid to begin to tell us that the environment was changing and that the customer behavior was changing this is our vision this was our understanding of what was happening within the environment and its going to continue to change and we think were building an agile workforce that will be first to adapt to many of these changes and deliver outsized performance i mean i remember three years ago when we sat there and laid out these efficiency targets no one thought that we would get them right and we will surpass them and i think the street will be pleased i think with where were headed and we continue to deliver outsized performance steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for all the color operator thank you ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank you operator operator instructions our next question will come from the line of matthew breese from stephens you may begin matthew breese q analyst stephens inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 hey good morning just following up on the expense discussion clearly theres been a lot of work done and the technology at least from what ive seen paying dividends but philosophically speaking should we expect expenses from here to mostly stabilize we see revenues without added cost is that at least philosophically the way to think about it or is there actual room to bring down the absolute level of expenses ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp i think as we said in our or as i said in my prepared remarks i think the lowhanging fruit part of it is done were never done in our ability to get more efficient or bring down expenses so we will always be trying to find places to do that however we do have to admit that as weve said were going to be growing the business were going to be adding new teams of bankers and so to the extent that they produced the revenue that offsets it and continues to show the positive operating leverage that we have historically shown in this quarter we showed operating leverage we got to keep our eyes on both sides of it but i dont think were done necessarily on the expense side matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then the other one for me is i couldnt help but ask in your 10q you mentioned implementing a new deposit service for businesses in the cannabis industry can you better frame for us that business whats on the balance sheet array the overall market as it currently stands and the opportunity whether its deposits loans fees ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp ill let tom address it in a couple of seconds but i think this is happening and were burying our heads in the sand if we think that this isnt going to really impact us from my perspective its better to come in with an approach as to how we want to handle it and be well bought out as opposed to letting the market dictate what that strategy is weve had an ability over the last year to really define who we wanted to partner with from an infrastructure perspective to make sure we had the right checks and balances in place to make sure we had the right aml processes in place and we could pick the partner that we wanted to really deal with as we begin to grow this when this becomes legal and more widespread throughout the entire banking industry i think people are going to take shortcuts in how they look at garnering this type of business and in my mind its much better to be proactive in addressing something than being reactive and i think that was our approach here its not sizable at this point weve picked a couple reputable partners as to how we want to grow and we think itll continue to pay some dividends but its not moving the needle on anything at this point tom is there something you wanted to add matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah matt its a depositfocused opportunity for us were going to onboard slowly within the state to do business where its legalized we have one multistate company that weve begun onboarding in both new jersey and valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 florida well continue to add other entities as we kind of get a little more comfortable and well go a slow pace in making sure were doing all the right amlbsa work and were verifying as we go along but as ira said its not going to move the needle this year but ultimately it could be impactful ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp and i think matt just one thing i would add i think my mind reflects where the organization is headed i think too many organizations look to covid look to this environment look to that environment and say well we need to not react we have a very strong understanding and very strong belief as to where the industry is headed not just covid but banking in general and we better be damn well proactive in how we address that and make sure that we have the right infrastructure and agility on our own without somebody telling us that we need to put this in place matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood last one for me ira clearly theres a lot of energy from you and the rest of the management team on what you can do internally is ma a priority here or do you think you have enough internally to get where you need to be without it can you prioritize where ma stands for us ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp look we have amazing strategic initiatives within this organization weve hired the most amazing tremendous people as well and i couldnt be more excited about where were headed theres new businesses that were beginning to get into from an organic perspective but theres a clear understanding that we need to continue to diversify the revenue stream look at opportunities as to how we create consistent growth from a deposit and loan perspective of that maybe and looking at different expanded strategies and geographies as tom was talking about earlier and we need to make sure that were looking out to have a positive operating leverage so if theres opportunities ph from ma perspective that makes sense that dont distract us that dont reallocate a tremendous amount of resources its something we would definitely entertain that said if it doesnt happen were absolutely comfortable i think the most important thing is we have a clear understanding of who we are where were headed and what we want to be we also have a clear understanding that there are things that could potentially accelerate that and if it makes sense from an allocation of resources perspective then we owe it to our shareholders to go down the path of looking at it from a diligence perspective that said it has to align with our strategic initiatives and if it doesnt its not something were going to focus on matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay well i appreciate you taking my questions thank you ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks matt valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thanks matt operator thank you our last question will be from the line of chris oconnell from kbw you may begin christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i just want to start off with that you guys mentioned the strength in the florida franchise and allocating some additional strategic resources towards those efforts if you could just kind of like expand upon the efforts that youre having there and im assuming its primarily on the residential mortgage side as well as the deposit gathering side thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp no no its primarily on the ci side as you know our real estate business in florida is very strong we have an active ci business well be expanding ci lenders in all of our major markets going miami all the way up to orlando jacksonville and over across to tampa down to naples so its that ci emphasis in florida and i also want to say were doing similar in new york we just dont need as many in new york we have a vibrant ci business up here in new york and new jersey and well be expanding that to complement that already strong real estate business so its a ci focus and well fill in real estate lenders here and there in the markets who need them ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp chris florida is a massively growing growing market obviously as you see the demographic shift we obviously have a very strong residential mortgage program throughout our entire footprint if you look at the footprint we averaged about this quarter in what was refinanced well what was home purchased if you look up in the new jersey market indiscernible about of that was refinanced its the exact opposite in florida most of the originations are based on home purchases there is a growing economy down in florida a lot of the loan growth that we see up here is definitely from a focus of us from a relationship perspective but also taking business from other banks theres real organic growth thats happening in florida and we think theres a real opportunity to continue to differentiate ourselves and put some additional growth on by allocating the resources down there thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 and just to expand of what ira said on the consumer side the florida purchase market is and refinance is and as ira pointed out its the flip side when you get up here in new york new jersey and more importantly in a very short period of time a couple years weve built a consumer business between florida alabama to almost billion so when you look at the florida contribution its not just the commercial of the portfolio its also a growing consumer business and again its a lot of conforming its a lot of prime and super prime and direct auto business thats coming out of there christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats great color thanks and as youre kind of thinking longer term or from a broader strategic perspective at florida obviously you guys have gone down there in the past with acquisitions but its been a while would you consider ma down in that area as well ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp look i think we would definitely consider ma in that marketplace but let me be clear this is sort of what our constraints are right so the constraint certainly revolves around what our strategic initiatives are and its not going to be complementary to one of those strategic initiatives its something we dont want to deal and we dont want to allocate resources but let me also talk about tangible book value right and its something that ive been pretty attuned to as to how we think about growth and what the franchise value is and we are absolutely not going to further dilute our shareholders to a significant degree just to continue to grow down in that florida marketplace we think we have a good foothold and theres organic growth that we can do down there if its tangible book value dilutive it has to make sense it has to be very very short from an earn back perspective and something we think that we can really really leverage and if it doesnt make sense from a tangible book value perspective then were not doing it we diluted our shareholders a significant amount back in in some of the other deals that we did we are not doing that again christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood thank you and then just a couple of cleanup items for the mortgage banking i mean obviously particularly strong year i mean how do you see that demand coming into the game line going forward thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah the demand in production this year was very strong for us probably up from the refinance market has held up so far this quarter we dont expect it to hold up for the full year at the same pace the purchase market is strong the migration into the suburbs and the purchase market is doing well also so its really hard to say i mean we are focused on conforming business so i dont expect growth in the portfolio but i do expect that well continue to manage and take advantage of the refinance market while its here christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats all i had thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks chris thanks operator thank you and i have no further questions in the queue i would like to turn the call back over to ira robbins for any closing remarks ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp we just want to
