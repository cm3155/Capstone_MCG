addressing our quarter results id first like to discuss the current business environment in puerto rico and how were responding to the covid19 pandemic as outlined in the first three slides of the presentation the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy creating significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increasing unemployment level the puerto rico macro indicator that we regularly provide remained stable through the end of february however the pandemic and related economic disruption has had a very dramatic impact on the markets we serve the local response to the covid19 pandemic has been substantial on march the governor of puerto rico mandated a strict lockdown for residents and ordered all nonessential business on the island to close indefinitely most business establishments are closed and those that remain open are only operating partially causing a significant disruption to the islands economic activity only businesses involved in providing essential services as defined by the governors executive order have been permitted to remain open and even those that have been even those have been curtailed in their operations for example banks have had to temporarily suspend mortgage and auto loan origination the severe lockdown restrictions have also disrupted commercial lending additionally the puerto rico government has mandated its citizens to remain sheltered in place and imposed a mandatory pm curfew puerto rico was the first us jurisdiction to enact this scale of a lockdown moodys analytics estimates that approximately of puerto ricos billion gdp has been impacted by this lockdown they estimate the economic costs through april at approximately billion and for as long as these restrictions remain in effect they estimate an additional cost of billion per week and reduced economic output while employment trends have remained stable through february initial unemployment claims have spiked over the past month in puerto rico as they have across the entire united states and as could be expected tourism has also been significantly impacted the puerto rico tourism company estimates the total hotel occupancy to be approximately according to the operator of the san juan international airport during january and february puerto rico received more passengers than however during march arrivals dropped by when compared to march dropping over over the last two weeks of the month and they have continued to drop the curfew and stay at home order have also had a dramatic impact on the spending patterns of our clients customer purchase activity has been severely impacted like employment trends through february were stable compared to the year ago period however for the days after the curfew was enacted debit and credit sales decreased by versus the same timeframe in both the local and federal governments have begun to provide relief and assistance in response to the pandemic to date the puerto rico government has approved a million fiscal stimulus plan additionally as part of the cares act puerto rico will receive approximately billion in funds including up to billion in direct payments popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 residents of puerto rico are also entitled to receive the supplemental federal unemployment benefit of per week our management team has been closely monitoring the spread of covid19 and has taken measures to ensure the soundness of our operations and the safety of our employees and customers weve strengthened our business continuity plan and our executive team is constantly meeting to monitor and implement actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic we are communicating regularly with our employees to keep them informed of the involving business environment and to help ensure their safety we offered alternative work arrangements for a significant portion of our employee base provided incremental training added personal leave days and paid approximately million in bonuses to frontline employees branches are operating under compressed schedules emphasizing drive thru where available and rotating personnel to reduce exposure i am deeply grateful to our colleagues for the effort commitment and bravery exhibited under very difficult circumstances we are encouraging customers to use alternative banking options such as our digital services smart atms telephone banking and drive through services weve increased transaction limits for remote deposits and atms we have also waived atm and certain other fees as well as early withdrawal penalties on cds most importantly we are assisting customers facing financial difficulties offering payment deferrals for mortgage auto and other consumer and commercial loans finally following the passage of the cares act we mobilized our human and tech resources to offer sba loans to affected small and medium sized businesses we have submitted more than billion in loans representing more than small and medium sized businesses todate we have received confirmation of sba approval of million of these submissions we will continue to accept and process applications until the funding is exhausted in our communities we have committed million to support efforts in four primary areas providing medical equipment to healthcare professionals supporting locally based healthcare research projects to combat covid providing financial advice and business continuity support to entrepreneurs and small and medium sized businesses and finally assisting nonprofit organizations to ensure the continuity of their services as we continue to respond to this rapidly changing situation our plans and actions will continue to evolve please turn to slide the quarters results reflecting impact of the economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic our reported quarterly net income of million was significantly lower than our results for the fourth quarter and compared to the first quarter of last year the primary driver of this decrease was a substantially higher provision expense reflecting the newly adopted cecl accounting pronouncement and the most recent postcovid macroeconomic forecast for puerto rico and the us aside from the increased provision the first quarter results were characterized by higher net interest income lower operating expenses and lower taxes partially offset by lower noninterest income in the quarter our noninterest income was impacted by reduced merchant transaction activity the waiving of certain fees and service charges the suspension of mortgage originations as well as lower income due to the covid19 disruptions over the last two weeks of march popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 additionally we have experienced higher expenses related to expanding remote access for employees additional employee benefits increased measures to protect employees and additional efforts related to customer relief programs excluding the adoption of cecl this quarter credit quality metrics through march continue to show stable results the continuing impact of covid19 on the economy and our operations will be heavily dependent on advances in the medical arena and how quickly economic activity can safely resume i will now turn the call over to carlos who will discuss the financial results in more detail carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide for first quarter results as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the fourth quarter net interest income for the quarter was million an increase of million from the fourth quarter the primary driver of this increase was higher loan balances we acquired a million credit card portfolio at the end of saw continued growth in our commercial auto and these portfolios in bppr as well as in the construction and mortgage portfolios in popular bank our deposit costs were down basis points in the quarter due to the effect of lower market rates from puerto rico public deposits and interest bearing deposits at popular bank nim for q1 was an basis point improvement from last quarter on a taxable equivalent basis nim was basis points higher than in q4 however we expect margins to decrease in q2 previously we have mentioned that the historical sensitivity of our net interest income to rate changes hovers around million to million per quarter for every basis point change in market rates this sensitivity was not evident in q1 because the change of market rates in march happened very late in the quarter q2 will reflect the full effect of lower rates assuming no other material changes in asset mix as has been the case for the last couple of years asset mix and the level of public deposits will also continue to have a material effect on our margin as of the end of the first quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion which is down slightly from q4 we still expect public deposit balances to come down over the long term but covidrelated federal assistance may increase balances in the near term the rate of expenditure of these funds and the timing of agreements on the governments debt restructuring will dictate the amount and timing of any balance reduction our loan portfolio grew by million in the quarter with our us business accounting for approximately million of that increase given the originations associated with ppp we expect loan balances to be higher in the second quarter while we had previously anticipated slight growth in loan balances in given the current environment that outlook is now uncertain the ultimate level of loan balances for will depend on the duration of the ppp loans and the performance of the economy for the remaining of the year popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 provision expense for the quarter of million reflects the adoption of cecl and incorporates the most recent covid affected macroeconomic forecast for puerto rico and the us the quarteroverquarter increase in allowance for credit losses was million or an increase of lidio will expand on this during his credit commentary noninterest income decreased by million nearly all fee categories decreased quarter over quarter insurance fees were million lower primarily due to the cecl nature of contingent commissions which are higher in the second and fourth quarters credit and debit card fees were million lower and were ph seeing none of our markets in the last two weeks in march mortgage results were negatively impacted by the evaluation adjustment of the msr as compared to the prior quarter we also recognized million in mortgage hedging losses in part related to the government mandated stoppage of mortgage origination in puerto rico since midmarch finally we had a million unfavorable variance in adjustments to indemnity reserves on loans sold with recourse the closure of business in our markets had an estimated negative effect on noninterest income of million in q1 we currently expect that lower client activity and the waiving of various fees will have a negative effect on non interest income of about million per month the speed at which we can return to more trend like noninterest income levels which average million to million per quarter over the last two years will depend on the rate of reopening of our markets and the increase in client activity levels total operating expenses were million million lower than the prior quarter personal costs decreased by million these decreases were driven by lower incentive compensation of million partially offset by a special covidrelated incentive to frontline employees of million business promotion costs were million lower in the first quarter approximately million of this decrease reflects the traditional seasonality of advertising sponsorships and promotion reduced customer activity resulted in lower reward program expenses of million these expense decreases were partially offset by slightly higher oreo and other operating expenses in response to lower interest rates and the effect of the pandemic on our business we will be implementing various cost saving initiatives that will affect personnel related expenses professional fees business promotion and other operating expenses we expect these efforts to result in savings of approximately million in as a result we now expect average quarterly expenses for the year to be around million as opposed to our prior guidance of million our effective tax rate for the quarter was which reflects the impact of lower taxable income driven by a higher provision for credit losses due to cecl which includes the impact of the covid19 pandemic for we currently expect our effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect to well capitalized regulatory requirements on january of this year we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement or asr for million in common stock under the terms of the asr our banking counterpart had the ability to terminate the asr if the corporations stock price drops to a prespecified level the increase of our stock price resulting from the pandemic triggered this clause and our asr was terminated on march popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 this termination has two effects first we realized a price discount on the real delivery of million shares second the remaining million yet to be delivered of the contract at termination time are settled via the delivery of additional shares acquired by our counterpart via continued market purchases at march we had received a total of million shares through april we have received an additional million shares we expect the complete settlement on termination of the asr to be closed out during the second quarter to complete our capital plan we also increased our quarterly common stock dividend and redeemed our series b preferred stock our common equity tier ratio in q1 was down from and tangible book value increased in the quarter by per share to the increase was driven by higher unrealized gains on investment our quarterly net income and a lower share count offset somewhat by our million buyback the day one effect of cecl and the payment of our dividend these is many market participants are doing versions of burn down analysis in this slide we include a calculation of our pro forma capital ratios applying the loss ratios of our last published dfast severely adverse stress test from in this simulation even after a severely adverse allowance for credit losses of billion we still end up with very strong cet1 ratio of this results reflect populars robust capital position the first quarter of allowance for credit losses represents of our severely adverse dfast loss estimate our return on tangible equity was in the first quarter affected by the previously described items mostly the provisions we will continue to pursue our target indiscernible return on tangible equity before i return the call over to lidio as a result of the adoption of cecl we increased our day one allowance for loan losses by million we also recognized an allowance for credit losses of approximately million related to held to maturity debt security portfolio these adjustments were recorded as a decrease to retained earnings as of january net of income taxes except for approximately million related to purchase credit impaired or pci loans previously accounted for under sop as advanced in our last webcast as part of the adoption of cecl the corporation made the election to break the existing pools of purchased credit impaired or pci loans which in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance were previously excluded from nonperforming status once transitioned to the individual loan measurement these loans are no longer excluded from nonperforming status resulting in an increase of million in npls as of january let me remind you that this is a change in classification of these loans not a change in payment or performance risk this reporting change does not in any way increase the credit risk contained in populars loan portfolio however the accounting treatment of these loans did result in a higher reported npl level we plan to phase in the effects of cecl on regulatory capital over a fiveyear period with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 thank you carlos and good morning before discussing the cecl impact and credit trends for the quarter i would like to take the opportunity to highlight changes that have occurred in popular credit risk profile since the last global financial crisis which you can see on slide number although one might be tempted to view popular in terms of the last crisis the reality is that we are a much different company with a stronger balance sheet and better risk profile in the us we stopped subprime lending in and today have limited subprime exposure in our consumer and mortgage business our us bank is now a community and niche lender with a lower risk profile in puerto rico since our commercial and construction exposure have decreased from of our total loan book to during the same timeframe construction lending has decreased by and now stands at million on the bottom half of the slide we also present the puerto rico commercial portfolio and include a net chargeoff distribution by segment since the important message from the table is our commercial mix has significantly improved by reducing exposure to asset classes with historically high losses in the consumer portfolio we have focused on two areas mortgage and auto lending thereby increasing the percentage of collateralized consumer loans we believe popular is wellpositioned to operate successfully during diverse economic environments given our improved risk profile and changes in our portfolio mix turning to page number we are closely monitoring the impact of the covid19 crisis on our entire loan portfolio however we believe that certain portfolio segments are more sensitive and are highlighted on this slide within nonessential retail the charter in place always has curtailed activity of this segment an important part of our shopping center portfolio in both regions are owned by longterm customer with financially strong principles that can withstand shortterm disruptions in cash flow in terms of the auto retail in puerto rico this activity was deemed nonessential under the governors lockdown order and sales have decreased significantly popular has had historically low losses in the dealer segment even during prolonged periods of decreased industry sales given the collateralized nature of these loans while we expect a significant level of deferred requests once auto dealers are allowed to reopen we expect a gradual increase in demand in the healthcare facility segment the story differs by geography our puerto rico exposure is to hospitals where restrictions on nonessential procedures have impacted admission levels and cash flows hospitals are eligible for ppt loans and other federal programs over investments of healthcare related expenses or loss revenues not otherwise reimbursed we expect this segment to quickly rebound once restrictions are lifted todate there have been low levels of deferment requests in the us our exposure is mainly to skilled nursing facilities this segment is a key component of the postacute care that will continue to experience high demand due to demographic trends and the structure of the us healthcare system several federal and local government funding programs are expected to be available through the hospital relief fund included in the cares act the majority of our customers are strong regional operators with significant global cash flows our largest customers have substantial liquidity at popular bank in terms of the construction segment most of our exposure is in the us and principally in the new york metro region the majority of our projects are in the late stage of completion have low loan to costs and nominal exposure to ph offer and residential overall principals have liquidity and have historically injected capital as necessary to date we have received a limited number of deferred requests in this portfolio popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 within the hospitality portfolio which includes restaurants and hotels we are closely monitoring our hotel exposure hotel balances ph million at quarter end mostly in puerto rico this segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to travel restrictions that have reduced occupancy rates although the speed of recovery is uncertain we believe that our business focus will serve us well as we expect business travelers will be the first to recover we have received a considerable number of payment deferral requests from borrowers in this segment restaurant balances were million at quarter end this segment has experienced stress driven by the shelter in place orders the majority of our restaurant borrowers particularly quick service or fast food have continued to operate through delivery and carryout once the economy starts to reopen we expect this segment to rebound at a faster pace especially the quick service restaurants we do not have ph material carrier exposure to oil aviation or indiscernible national credits please turn to page number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets increased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by nonperforming loan increase of million the increase in npl is driven by puerto rico mainly due to loans previously accounted for as purchased credit impaired this portion of our changing npls does not in any way increase our credit risk upon being measured at the individual loan level these loans are no longer excluded from nonperforming status resulting in an increase of million in npl as of january this increase included million in loans earlier over days past due and million in loans that are not delinquent in their payment terms but are reported as nonperforming due to other credit quality considerations excluding this impact npls decreased by million mostly related to lower mortgage npls in the us npl increased by million due to the transition to purchase credit deteriorated loans of the taxi medallion portfolio at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio was compared to in the fourth quarter of please turn to slid number to discuss npl interest excluding the purchase credit deteriorated loans transition npl inflows increased by million on a linked quarter basis driven by repurchased mortgage loans in the us inflows of npls were relatively flat quarteroverquarter turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to million or annualized basis points of average loans heldinportfolio related to net chargeoff taken in the previous quarter in our taxi medallion portfolio reflecting agreements reached with the majority of our taxi medallion borrowers the corporation allowance for credit losses increased by million from the prior quarter to million driven by the day one impact of the cecl adoption coupled with changes in the macroeconomic condition from the covid19 pandemic we provide further details of the day one and day two impacts on the following slide the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio was in the first quarter of compared to in the previous quarter the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio stood at compared to in the previous quarter the provision for credit losses increased by million from the prior quarter mainly driven by the covid19 impact on the macroeconomic scenarios the provision to net charge off ratio was in the first quarter of popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 please turn to slide number to discuss details on the drivers of the increase to our allowance for credit losses under cecl we adopted cecl on january since implementation our allowance for credit losses related to loan has increased by million or driven by the day one adoption impact changes to the economic scenarios and loan portfolio growth the day one adoption impact resulted in an increase of million in the acl the day one impact was mainly driven by increases in the following puerto rico loan portfolios consumer by million mortgage by million and commercial by million the economic scenario utilized was based on the march moodys analytics s3 downside scenario this scenario assumes a double dip recession starting in the second quarter of the us stimulus plan enables gdp growth in the third quarter but the economy declines again in the fourth quarter and its not until the second quarter of that a sustained recovery begins under this scenario unemployment peaks in the second quarter with rates of in the us and in puerto rico economic activity in the second quarter declines by in the us and in puerto rico this scenario causes the allowances for credit losses to increase by million driven by increases in puerto rico consumer and us commercial to summarize the adoption of cecl mythology and the impact of the covid19 pandemic caused significant changes in certain credit metrics particularly the level of npls the allowance and provision for credit losses and related ratios and early delinquency indicators as we stopped collection efforts in the second half of march the effects of the covid19 crisis continue to evolve and the full extent of the economic disruption is uncertain the improvement over the last few years in the risk profile of our loan portfolio positions popular to successfully operate under the challenging environments we will continue to carefully review the exposure to coronavirus related risk changes in the economic outlook and the effect on credit quality with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your update to summarize our results for the quarter were impacted by a large increase in our provision expense reflecting the newly adopted cecl methodology and the most recent post covid19 macroeconomic forecast for puerto rico and the us however our operating results for the first quarter were solid given the extent of the economic acceleration experienced during the second half of march the covid19 global pandemic has exposed the fragility of our economic and social system and the need for greater collaboration between all sectors i am hopeful that it will also reveal what can we accomplish when we work together in pursuit of a common goal at popular the wellbeing of our customers employees and communities is our priority we have acted decisively to help our employees stay safe while we continue to offer essential banking services to our customers and communities during our years we have often operated in highly uncertain and volatile economic periods and have always managed through them successfully almost three years ago we faced the impacts of hurricane maria which popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 indiscernible in many cases for months we responded decisively adapted to change and delivered favorable results even under these very difficult conditions while each situation presents unique challenges we havent seen the experience and the financial resources to do so again and i am optimistic about the future of our company despite the uncertainty we are all facing as we fight this pandemic we are confident that with our strong liquidity position and capital levels we are wellprepared to successfully manage for the current challenges we are now ready to answer your questions thank you question and answer section operator well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster first question comes from alex twerdahl piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co first off just talking about the cecl provision here and kind of the assumptions and really appreciate that you laid everything out here on slide but as i look at this indiscernible former dfast assumptions from a couple of years ago can you talk about the differences in the assumptions for dfast that would cause the reserve or the chargeoffs to go that much higher lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc ill take that i think whenever you look at the construct of dfast scenarios its more id say more of an elongated u type of recovery so we have an impact of economic downturn for about four or five quarters and then you start the road to recovery and these have to be measured the losses associated with a specified period while the cecl obviously is lifetime losses will that certainly create a difference between ph what you compute versus dfast but i think the other aspect that is different is the economic scenario in which the usually the dfast is elongated u the scenario that would model today is more is sort of like a w with the recovery starting in popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co exhibit on the ph statutory to be much more elongated in more of a u versus what you have modeled so its the length of the downturn more than anything else lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i dont think that was partly obviously there has been significant changes in the credit composition and credit quality of our portfolios so those are the other things that also impact those comparisons alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful and then sort of the way that the million shares in the second quarter and then is there an adjustment to equity as well carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc no i think that the exactly the shares were going to receive will depend on the execution of the termination agreement alex i mean the best way to think about it is that when the asi was terminated the initial number of shares that were delivered to us that part of it is sort of closed out and then the contract itself requires that a settlement process that is also in shares and that is what is ongoing now the first delivery of indiscernible  will benefit from a discount on the original contract the additional purchases dont but i think the two the main the more important change here is that this program which we expected to end late this year will actually end in the second quarter so the full effect of the asr will be done in the second quarter as opposed to the third discounted for already alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co which will give you the full years benefit of the program ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc correct alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co because it will not be an adjustment in equity okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc correct under the original contract that reduction that last reduction of shares would have happened late in the year and now its going to happen in the second quarter popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co well thats great and then just final question for me and maybe this one is a little bit more forward thinking but one thing thats always struck me when i go down to puerto rico is just how unbelievably crowded the bank branches are and especially when you compare them to branches in new york city for example does the ongoing crisis right now does it cause you to rethink or give you any indications that the way the banking could change on a more sort of permanent basis down there and kind of help you rethink the way that you are allocating expenses over the next year and into ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc well im not sure over the next year this is ignacio i mean everything this pandemic will cause us to rethink almost everything but definitely were going to be looking at it but one thing people forget there are less branches per inhabitant in puerto rico than there are in the us so were not overbranched as an industry thats one thing the transaction levels have remained high now people this pandemic has led to more digital transactions whether that will be a permanent change i dont know but you dont see lines in our branches anymore but you do see lines in our drive through so therere still a lot of people transacting physically another thing i want to add is that as opposed to some of our markets like new york and south florida the cost of operating branches in puerto rico is not huge our rental expense our community expense for branches is relatively small the biggest expense is the employees but with trend toward digital well see how that plays out operator next question comes from mark palmer of btig please go ahead mark palmer q analyst btig llc yes thanks very much for taking my question first of all with regard to the deferred payments just wanted to ask about the mechanics of how that would work once we get back to a resumption of payments as it pertains to the overall loan balance will the deferred payments essentially be tacked on to the end of the loan such that the maturity schedule will be pushed back or is there some other approach that would be taken ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc thats generally how its going to work for our mortgage products for some of the other consumer products the mortgage products has precomputed interest so we just move into the auto loans although at the end they have simple interest so the mechanics are a bit different in each product but yes for mortgage it is just tacked at the end mark palmer q analyst btig llc okay thank you and with regard to the companys provision for loan losses how should we think about how that could evolve in the second quarter and beyond popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc weve had some lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc scenarios i mean theres nothing much i can add to that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes its complex to comment about the provision looking forward because we have to run the models and we dont even know what the inputs on economic centers are going to be by the end of the quarter ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc so a lot of uncertainty and obviously this is different than some of the other economic crisis we faced i mean some of the models are going to be dependent on the health outcomes right as you saw earlier today development to the health can move the markets can move economic forecast so well have to see what happens how successfully economies open up or dont open up whether the ones that open up faster have problems so theres a lot of question marks that are mark palmer q analyst btig llc okay all right thanks very much carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thanks mark operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good afternoon everyone ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc hey how are you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good afternoon popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you for the detail by the way always very very helpful and on slide looking at the sensitive segments to covid19 and you listed the deferrals can you from your experience with the hurricanes that youve been through in the past and the deferral programs youve used in those time periods what percentage of deferrals actually go back to accruing versus generally speaking lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i mean i will tell you based on our experience with maria generally most of our clients continue to accrue it so we did not have a negative experience to the deferment to the contrary it was very gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and i know you guys have discussed on the call what the current conditions are in terms of the lockdowns and stuff and i apologize if you addressed this i had to jump off the call what outlook is instructions will be lifted if there is an outlook for that at this time ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc yes its a bit uncertain the governor of puerto rico is receiving input both from a medical taskforce and an economic taskforce as you can imagine their perspective is a little bit different the medical taskforce being more conservative on what theyre recommending and the economic taskforce being little more open we are expecting her to say something i think by tomorrow saturday at the latest because the current lockdown expires on sunday so i think there will be a gradual opening more gradual than in some of the other jurisdictions for example because our lockdown has been more severe than other jurisdictions most jurisdictions for example banking and essential services exempted or she has limited some of the things even banks can do as weve mentioned in the call mortgage and auto loans are basically suspended so i would anticipate it will open up somewhat probably with construction maybe some professional services but shes going to take it i think in more gradual than some of the other state governments and as you know weve been have so far weve had a pretty successful story in puerto rico in terms of the number of deaths have been relatively low our hospitals are not overwhelmed and in fact we have the opposite problem the census in many of our hospitals is very low so i cant complain about that obviously we all want the economy to open but we dont want to be in a situation we have a big second wave and have people open to close again so i think well begin to open but i think itll be more gradual than some of the other us jurisdictions that youve seen gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just lastly on your economic scenarios on the slide once again thank you for the detail the qtoq declined in the united states real gdp im presuming that second quarter versus do you guys have what the estimate was that you used for the full year decline versus popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i dont have that handy well provide that to you gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you great thank you guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from arren cyganovich of citi please go ahead arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc broker thanks just on your kind of w forecast and i apologize for kind of hitting this third time ive kind of asked this question but have the scenarios worsened from moodys since the march i mean youre using kind of a different one i think than realized is that forecast too much since the end of march carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i havent really looked at the recent scenarios by moodys the difference i mean most of our peers i think use the baseline with our base on a benchmark analysis that the downsize scenario the s3 was more reflective of the reality and thats the one we use as of quarter end arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc broker yes i would agree with that too the other question i had was on the deferrals whats the process here for and to the extent that these that you are continued to be locked down for a while how long can these deferrals go out before you start to have to recognize them as underperforming loans ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc thats a difficult accounting question but normally if look at the mortgage loans we do have the cares act which sets the standard basically that under law any federally supported guaranteed loan we have to give a six month deferral and if the client asked for an additional six months in puerto rico theyve adopted a law for most of the other consumer products that requires up to four months i think within the terms of those limits we should be okay from nonaccrual those are statutory mandated across the board requirements other than that it becomes more of a case by case analysis of the present value of the payments how much its impacted and but within those statutory limits i think well be okay arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc broker okay thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 thanks aaron operator this
