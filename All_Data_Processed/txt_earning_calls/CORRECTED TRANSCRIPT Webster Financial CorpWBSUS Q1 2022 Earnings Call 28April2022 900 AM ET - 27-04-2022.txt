us for our first quarter earnings call it was an eventful quarter as we close our merger indiscernible with sterling executed on our integration plan and announced and completed the acquisition of bend financial all while continuing to generate solid performance in our underlying businesses ill begin with some high level remarks on the macro environment our performance for the first quarter of and ill provide a quick update on the merger ill turn it over to glenn after that to review our financials the financial effects of the merger and to provide our outlook for full year despite uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment driven by war in ukraine supply chain labor market challenges and the lingering impacts of covid and some of you may have seen the surprising gdp contraction this morning we feel that the underlying strength in economic activity remains strong demand for debt financing and continued confidence among our clients is prevalent and our base case continues to call for solid economic growth rising interest rates and positive trending in loan demand over the next six to eight quarters we are very pleased with our performance in q1 our reported net income was a loss of million and eps was a loss of these results however were impacted by various onetime merger related charges including the nonpcd double count provision for sterling excluding these merger related expenses adjusted net income was million and adjusted earnings per share was those adjusted metrics equate to return on assets and a return on common tangible equity of loans and deposits grew smartly yearoveryear driving material revenue growth we effectively manage expenses and our efficiency ratio was approximately for the quarter credit performance continues to be favorable excluding the nonpcd provision included in the merger accounting our provision for the quarter was million all credit metrics remained strong including our npl and total loans ratio at basis points period end down from basis points for standalone webster a year ago im now on slide we closed our merger on january were excited to be operating as a combined organization and believe our combination is as strategically compelling today as it was when we announced it a year ago we now have billion in assets billion in deposits and billion in loans as a combined company as was our intent at the outset we have created a commercially focused bank that we believe can outperform as we leverage our significant expertise industry verticals and broad asset generation capabilities our funding and liquidity profile is a differentiated strength for webster as our diversified sources of low beta deposits including from our hsa bank franchise should provide a competitive advantage as interest rates rise and liquidity returns to more normalized levels our loan to deposit ratio of provides ample flexibility for us going forward in combination with a predominantly floating rate loan portfolio we expect significant income improvement in a rising interest rate environment our tangible book value per share and capital levels at close were roughly in line with our expectations at merger announcement we expect to achieve million in realized cost sales in and another million of savings for the full year weve begun the consolidation of our corporate real estate footprint and expect to reduce our combined corporate square footage by over by the end of the year weve eliminated redundant operating costs were identified and at quarter end of the combined organization was operating at of its head count relative to merger announcement a year ago webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 we expect to complete the core banking systems conversion in the third quarter of all customer facing rebranding has been completed in combination with the financial merits of the deal and strong business execution we are well on the path to sustainably generating the targeted financial metrics we set forth a year ago at deal announcement including a high teens return on tangible common equity with respect to outstanding people we have seen effectively no attrition among clientfacing colleagues due to the merger or the competitive labor market and in fact weve added additional commercial bankers and have a pipeline of teams and portfolios that we believe will help us sustain our growth momentum slide covers loans we have great business momentum heading into the second quarter excluding the effects of tpp and the material contraction in mortgage warehouse balances due to the rate environment linkedquarter loan growth for the two legacy entities combined with or annualized yearoveryear growth on the same basis was growth was driven primarily by commercial categories as anticipated as we have discussed with many of you our increased balance sheet capacity allows us to immediately expand relationships with our existing customer base as a proof point at yearend the combined banks had a total of relationships with exposure greater than million with a bigger balance sheet since legal day one of the merger on january we prescreened deals and approved deals with exposures over million the higher hold trend has contributed to our confidence in reaching our to full year loan growth targets we feel good about our ability to leverage our bigger balance sheet without sacrificing credit quality and without expanding our existing underwriting guidelines of note the weighted average risk rating of our top exposures is more than half a turn better than that of our overall loan portfolio asset quality improves as whole levels increase deposits on a combined basis also exhibited solid growth this quarter up on a linkedquarter basis and up almost yearoveryear our deposit cost declined basis point despite the start of fed tightening and higher market rates broadly growth this quarter was principally driven by hsa and our government banking business hsa added new accounts and core deposits increased almost billion as mentioned earlier we closed on our acquisition of bend this quarter which we view as another proof point with respect to the merger providing additional opportunities to accelerate growth in lowcost longduration hsa deposits with that ill turn it over to glenn glenn i macinnes executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone let me start with our periodend balance sheet on slide at period end our total loans were billion total assets were billion and total deposits were billion on a pro forma basis linkedquarter loan growth was led by million in sponsor and specialty and million in ci this was partially offset by declines in mortgage warehouse and ppp pro forma deposits increased billion or linkedquarter with growth across all categories except higher cost cds borrowings ended the period at billion capital ratios continue to be exceptionally strong post merger with a common equity tier ratio of and the tangible common equity ratio of at merger announcement we had estimated a pro forma common equity tier ratio of at close tangible book value per common share was down from last quarter a number of factors contributed to the decline including merger accounting merger related charges and the impact of afs securities valuation marks on aoci webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 moving on to slide we detail the various merger and restructuring adjustments for the quarter including a reversal of approved strategic initiative expenses merger related expenses and the nonpcd double count provision in aggregate these three items attracted from eps for the quarter on slide we provided a reported to adjusted and pro forma income statement which includes the january adjusted results for sterling the january sterling performance is excluded from our reported results as it occurred prior to the closing of the merger on an adjusted basis we reported million of net income available to common or in diluted earnings per share in the quarter our preprovision net revenue was million our return on assets was return on tangible common equity was and we had an efficiency ratio of i will point out that our adjusted performance benefited from the deferred tax valuation adjustment of million in the quarter which is reflected in the effective tax rate of as john highlighted earlier we feel very good about the trajectory of our returns given where we are in the integration process on the next three slides we have provided trends on pro forma income statement categories to give you a better sense of the starting point as we head into the second quarter slide shows our net interest income for the quarter million in total net interest income includes million reported for webster and million for sterling in january this includes million in purchase accounting accretion the pro forma net interest margin for the quarter was while the net interest margin excluding the effects of purchase accounting was noninterest income is presented on slide noninterest income is again presented on a pro forma combined basis including sterlings january noninterest income when combining websters reported noninterest income of million for q1 with million for sterling in january the total is million the linkedquarter decline from q4 reflects lower investment gains of million realized at webster and million at sterling in addition we recognized lower wealth management and mortgage banking fee income noninterest expense is presented on slide webster reported million in adjusted expenses and sterlings january adjusted expenses were million which totaled to million on a linkedquarter basis the general trend in noninterest expense was driven by a decrease in q4 performancebased expenses which was partially offset by seasonal benefit expenses and intangible amortization total intangible amortization on a pro forma basis was million in each of the prior periods compared to million in q1 moving on to our allowance on slide the allowance totaled million for the quarter largely driven by mergerrelated accounting the net pcd allowance for sterling added million and was marked through the balance sheet the pcd allowance adjustment is the net of million in gross pcd reserves was million in chargeoffs recognized at acquisition reflecting balances written off by sterling in prior periods the nonpcd provision added million in accordance with purchase accounting this is recognized as a provision through the income statement this commonly referred to as the double count as the assets are both marked on the balance sheets and income statement the balance of our increase was the net effect of million chargeoffs and million provision expense slide we provide our key asset quality metrics as john indicated earlier our asset quality remains strong including an npl ratio of basis points and the commercial classified loans totaling basis points of the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 commercial portfolio this compares to basis points and basis points respectively on a combined basis at year end on slide we are exceptionally wellpositioned from a capital perspective our regulatory capital ratios exceed well capitalized levels by substantial amounts our common equity tier ratio of exceeds well capitalized by billion and our tier riskbased capital of exceeds well capitalized by billion our tangible book value per share of is up from prior year slide provides our estimated purchase accounting marks at close relative to expectations at merger announcement loan marks totaled million compared to million anticipated at announcement including march related to credit interest and liquidity our security mark of million is lower than the originally anticipated mark of million driven by the higher rate environment the core deposit intangible is estimated at million versus million at announcement again driven by higher rates weve also added million of intangibles for customer relationships related to reoccurring revenue portfolios in our commercial bank segment the property and equipment mark was million goodwill and other intangibles totaled billion in line with the announcement on slide we have provided the expected income statement impacts of the merger in accordance with acquisition accounting sterlings previously scheduled yield accretion and intangible amortization are eliminated in the first quarter we realized million of purchase accounting accretion in net interest income our scheduled accretion for the calendar year is million in the first quarter purchase accounting accretion benefited the net interest margin by basis points with respect to intangible asset amortization webster reported million in intangible amortization in q1 which includes million related to the merger total intangible amortization will be million for q2 including the full effect of the merger and legacy amortization on slide we provide our full year outlook each of these items assumes no material change in the macroeconomic or regulatory environment we expect net interest income of billion on a gaap basis excluding accretion our projection assumes the fed funds rate end the year at implying an additional basis points of rate increases our net interest income projection also anticipates loans grow at to annually beginning from our legal day one balances of billion we expect fee income of million to million and expenses excluding onetime cost of billion to billion so we continue to monitor inflationary headwinds we anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of to going forward with that ill turn things back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn when jack kopnisky and i decided to embark on the merger of our two companies in addition to the financial merits of the transaction there were several aspects to this merger that made it particularly compelling including the ability to elevate the best talents from both organizations the alignment and complementary nature of the lending verticals a uniquely valuable funding base and scale that would allow us to accelerate investment in differentiated businesses already in the first few months as a combined company we are executing on the strategic benefits we felt this merger will provide were elevating the best talent from both organizations the executive management committee is a balanced group coming from each legacy organization were committed to building a webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 contemporary and valuesbased culture in the new organization the leadership team has coalesced around and agreed upon set of core values and respected behaviors these have been followed on into a cultureshaping program already rolled out across the bank our company and our colleagues are committed to outstanding corporate citizenship and i encourage you to read our recently published esg report available on our website as previously highlighted we had solid loan originations and net loan growth in key commercial segments and we are immediately realizing on the ability to execute on larger transactions particularly on our differentiated sponsor specialty and institutional commercial real estate business we have an exceptional low cost sticky deposit base led by hsa bank and the consumer banking network of the combined organization we were able to reduce our cost of deposits by basis point this quarter and continue to explore new customer verticals and digital delivery channels that should further enhance our funding position were investing in digital capabilities we saw a couple of examples in the first quarter as previously mentioned we purchased bend financial a cloudbased solutions provider in the hsa space were excited about the technology bend brings to our platform and the business benefits its clientfacing experience will provide in addition through our innovations group webster joined the usdf consortium as a founding member the consortium will work to support likeminded forwardthinking banks as they work to integrate blockchain capabilities into their operations as an active and engaged participant in the consortiums activities we will benefit from the pooled expertise and network effects of other members we will continue to invest in our data environment and migrate our digital platforms to the cloud we expect to generate significant returns and excess capital at a combined organization as we set forth at the merger announcement a year ago this will provide us with significant capital flexibility going forward well continue to be disciplined in our capital management framework allocating capital to those businesses and activities that generate the highest return on equity we will deploy capital into differentiated and growing organic activities first and into commercial loan portfolios and select inorganic business or product acquisitions like we did with bend well also continue to return capital to our shareholders in the absence of organic opportunities through dividends and share repurchases in q1 we repurchased over million in shares and have replenished our repurchase authorization as announced yesterday finally i want to thank all of our webster colleagues for their engagement efforts and execution weve asked a lot of every colleague over the last year as we were preparing for the merger close and delivering outstanding performance in a challenging macro environment our colleagues stepped up and delivered for our clients our communities and for our shareholders with that glenn and i are prepared to take questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc glenn hey glenn maybe start on the expense the guide was pretty much in line with what we are looking for im just interested in kind of the cadence as you realize the million of cost saves this year and million next year where do expenses effectively go to over the next four five quarters and then well lift from there once the synergies are less glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah thanks chris and good morning let me give you a little more texture on the million because i can say we have a pretty clear sight on how were going to achieve that and it sort of falls in three categories the elimination of redundancies the consolidation of corporate facilities as you probably heard john note in his remarks the reduction of square footage and then operational efficiencies from the consolidation of vendor contracts operating systems and automation so we gave you guidance that sort of gets us to billion to billion and i would say that the trajectory is probably going to get us to a range in the range of like a by the fourth quarter i want to sort of preface that with that in the fourth quarter we have basically we do traditionally have a spike in hsa type of expenses somewhat offset by lower employee comprelated costs on the healthcare and things like that so thats a range i would say that that would be your jumpoff range in the fourth quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then from there theres still a little bit more i guess to go for but theres always theres also inflationary pressure so glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so look were sticking with the achieving the additional million in the big driver of that will be the completion of our core banking conversion which will generate significant savings and then well as you would expect well get a fullyear run rate of a lot of the initiatives that we executed this year webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then if i could just one more on the margin the expansion was a little bit better than we thought given the challenges of two months in the quarter can you just provide like what the march core margin was for a liftoff for q2 glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats the month of march okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp exaccretion right christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks chris operator our next question is from casey haire with jefferies please proceed casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc wanted to touch i guess slide the loan growth obviously a little bit slower this quarter but i guess could you just give us some color on the mix lots of moving parts here ci very good sponsor specialty also very good is this a similar mix that we can get to expect in the remaining quarters to get to that to and then also sponsor specialty i know john you really love that vertical what is the limit on that concentrationwise webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its great question casey and you can probably hear that on obviously the contraction in mortgage warehouse and runoff of ppe is what sort of muted the gap reported loan growth but obviously for me the underlying characteristics on page are strong because the proof point on this transaction was in our institutional real estate ci and sponsor specialty that we had a lot of momentum and with a bigger balance sheet we were going to be able to accelerate loan growth and thats why im still pretty confident mortgage warehouse is about million in balances right now we dont see that contracting much more during this kind of purchasing season and kind of our general thought is that that million would be a good average balance for that business for the rest of the year so neither a big driver of growth nor a drag but as you noted our originations were really strong across ci sponsor specialty and actually in cre we just had an inordinate amount of prepayments it sort of spilled over from the fourth quarter in investor cre so a lot of momentum there and i think as we talked about when we announced this deal our sponsor specialty business on our billion loan portfolio is a standalone legacy webster company we were sort of saying to ourselves hey are we reaching maybe a threshold of concentration and now and on the other side from a legacy sterling perspective we had a relative concentration of commercial real estate you look at this billion loan portfolio and the granular nature of all these categories we really have significant running room to expand in all of these categories so that growth in a single quarter in sponsor is terrific again some of that was because of lower prepayments i wouldnt pencil that in but we expect general ci across all the middle market businesses investor cre and sponsor specialty to continue to grow smartly from a good pipeline stronger loan demand and a bigger balance sheet so thats why i think the underlying numbers here from a loan growth perspective are not discouraging because of the geography of what sort of muted the growth casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay great and then on the buyback you guys announced a million renewal last night ahead of that million in the quarter ahead of that million or so expectation a deal announcement can you just give us some updated thoughts on your buyback appetite going forward john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure i think were going to continue to be disciplined and opportunistic the environments a bit choppy obviously we had the increased authorization which makes sense given the size of our company and moving forward and as i articulated i think our first products for us is outsized loan growth portfolio purchases team left outs opportunistic product enhancements for companies like for activities and divisions like hsa bank but obviously we look to say a to payout ratio we play a pretty robust dividend and if we dont have line of sight to organic investment and we dont feel like theres a recessionary environment right in front of us so we feel pretty confident well certainly use some of that authorization to buy back shares over the course of the next three to four quarters casey haire q analyst jefferies llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 okay very good and just last one for me glenn slide the asset sensitivity slide you guys point out a beta over the first months of the forecast does that hold for bps of hikes and bps glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp so we have we have increased that if you recall for the last call we were sort of in the range i think thats something that we have to look at and were using right now i think we do have a ramp up toward the end part of the year the wildcard here casey is if that goes and i think it may spike up but what were using in our model right now on a full year basis 12month ramp up basis is like casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and that holds for bps as well or just a bps glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah it does it holds for bps as well casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks casey operator our next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed alex yao q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd hi good morning this is alex yao on for steve thanks for taking my question john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey alex alex yao q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd as you guys integrate the two companies together what are some of your more immediate revenue synergies that youre targeting and beyond that what are some of the larger opportunities that will take more time for revenue synergies thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 yeah thats a great question i think the immediate ones ive already referenced which is a larger balance sheet to be able to have more profitable and larger relationships with our existing commercial clients potentially more capital market fees depending on market conditions so that scale of balance sheet and our existing penetration in key commercial categories is kind of the immediate revenue synergy theres obviously more crosssell opportunities for example our private bank legacy webster private bank is selling into the commercial portfolio at legacy sterling is an immediate opportunity to get more penetration in wealth management as we have broader products and services to sell into and to deliver to our clients across a bigger footprint on the one hand side theres a lot of exciting things because were working through our innovations group to think about ways we can digitally serve million retail clients at hsa bank and digitize other products so we feel that were spending a lot of time on our longer term strategies around are there opportunities to digitize and sell cards or shortterm loan products into hsas can we use our bigger balance sheet and larger corporate relationships to leverage more sales of hsa of our standard and basic hsa products into a larger corporate client base at webster so i think immediately what youll see is in our core commercial relationships broader deeper more profitable relationships and over the longterm our ability to create more crossselling products across the bank and hsa through innovation and digital products alex yao q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd thanks john and one question on the hsa business so coming out of the pandemic can you talk about the hsa business and if youre seeing some return to normal for that business such as for balanced growth and fee income thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah another great question alex and we have not back to prepandemic levels but there was muted activity you probably heard us over the last several calls talk about one of the dynamics was that most of the deposit growth and account growth came actually from existing clients so further penetration into existing clients that sort of waned a little bit as general activity slowed during the pandemic as you heard me mention in my script we had new accounts and obviously net account growth reported was a little bit muted by the tpa account still running off but that was an increase over last years account growth and so that was healthy almost a half a billion in new core deposits which was also a positive trend line and what we did see underlying that was more of our existing clients were signing up new employees to high deductible health plans and hsa accounts so id say thats trending in the right direction towards prepandemic levels and i think we saw the same thing as well in our card swipes and activity just from discretionary healthcare activities and the like so definitely encouraging not yet back to where we like it glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah let me just add a little bit color on a debit transactions as an example i think we did million in the quarter thats versus million so thats the transaction volume is up yearoveryear a little over so we are seeing some of that on a light quarter basis prior year webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 alex yao q analyst jpmorgan securities asia pacific ltd thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks alex operator our next question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning just to follow up on the hsa questions i noticed the onbalance sheet deposits your offbalance sheet funds are growing significantly faster is that the kind of mix we should expect going forward and can you compare the economics of the two john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure were happy to we talk about this a good amount so the answer is the trend line obviously well overall penetration in the investment category is still relatively low its increasing but relatively low obviously the larger balance accounts are the ones that transition into investments and obviously when you look at that number theres also the benefit or detriment of market performance that moves that around and so obviously over the course of last year there was significant expansion in the value of those investments as well as more people going into those investments its no secret and were very transparent about the fact that for us and i would say particularly in rising interest rate environment the deposits are more valuable to us because we get the full benefit of the value of those deposits to deploy directly into loan and asset growth and with respect to the investments through both our proprietary offering and indiscernible and our vendor we only get really fees from that so were talking you know somewhere between basis points and basis points depending on which avenue that runs and so it is less profitable on its face however what weve always said is the investors in our hsa client base tend to have high average deposit balances as well and tend to be among our stickiest depositors so we obviously want to provide our clients with as much flexibility as we can there and so i think at the end of the day theres a nice virtuous cycle that allows us to keep deposit growth running albeit for its not as profitable webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and as a follow up can you give us sort of a level set range now assuming relative stability not a recession ahead in terms of net chargeoff range for the combined company going forward john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its a tough one ive been surprised as you know as a former credit guy about the way credit has performed even leading up into the pandemic period i would say we were experiencing that kind of 20basis point give or take annualized net chargeoffs before the pandemic i think that if you think about commercial categories if there ever is kind of a return to normal maybe think about that basis point to basis point annualized chargeoff rate as more of a normalized commercial chargeoff rate and obviously we still havent seen it theres been a lot of stimulus and other reasons why but thats probably in our minds where we think it would normalize on a commercial basis brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks for the questions john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you brock operator our next question is from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting with the nii guide does that assume sort of a stable mix of loans and securities in cash from where we are right now or is that loan growth acceleration we assume that a lot of that is funded or some of thats funded out of cash and securities glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so it assumes somewhere between to of loan growth so you could say right in the middle it does assume that some of our securities portfolio will help fund that but i think all in thats where we are so theres some borrowings as well that you would expect to see we have drawn down our cash levels as you know for the last couple of quarters so our securities portfolio is about billion so as we now reach the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 phase where well start to realize that loan growth youll probably see the securities portfolio start to temper down a little bit jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay thats good color and then what was aoci on a combined basis at quarter end glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp so the total aoci jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp from securities so jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes please glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp so the impact of the securities if thats what youre looking for the impact of the valuation of securities after tax million and so that impacted we started out i mentioned the tangible common equity ratio of really strong that includes that basis point reduction from the unrealized loss on the afs portfolio jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay got it thats great thank you and then when we look at the accretion this this quarter what were the you had mentioned the accelerated pay down glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess on carry what was the actual balance of pay downs and was that more than you were expecting glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 so it was about million in accretion impact as i think as i mentioned in my comments im sure that we had the balances associated with it jared but ill circled back with you on the actual loan balances that prepaid on jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good thanks and then just finally for me sort of following up on brocks question about the charge offs whats the expectation for the ratio of the allowance for credit loss as we move forward is there still a larger qualitative reserve tied into that or are we sort of good with that glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc in the current year glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp i guess were coverage and i think were expecting like a stable acl ratio and well continue to monitor credit quality macro loan mix loan growth as well i think john hit on it in some of his comments that there is a qualitative portion and were being somewhat conservative on that until we see how things play out over the next couple of quarters john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think thats spot on i think we feel really good about the reserve as glenn said another way to say we think its relatively conservative i think there is enough choppiness going forward that its the right reserve level now but if we do see some of the uncertainty going forward the war or some of the other choppiness kind of settle down we do think there may be an opportunity to lower that reserve a bit jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot operator our next question is from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please proceed david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks for taking the question you mentioned at the outset about the economy contracting and a question i always seem to get whenever recession enters the narrative related to webster is your leveraged loan exposure could you talk about what the exposure is there and any details you can provide to giving investors comfort related to historical loss rates leverage multiples equity contribution by private equity sponsors to provide cushion for you guys can you rattle off some stats there webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp david you love to ask me that question i could stay here for the next hour and talk about it but i promise i wont and i weaved in that contraction in the gdp from one of my colleagues here last minute because it wasnt in my script but i dont want to seem like we were blind through what was going on hey one of the other reasons we talked about another benefit of doing this transaction and having a bigger balance sheet is that again from a concentration perspective it gives sponsor specialty more running room under a prudent portfolio approach to management to the way we manage it so i will tell you that as of quarter end our kind of regulatory defined definition of leveraged loans was a roughly of the entire loan portfolio of the organization with like credit performance to the rest of the portfolio as weve said before thats kind of held historically through both the great financial crisis through the pandemic in that while there may be volatility in risk rating at times it performs at or better than the rest of the portfolio and it goes to some of the things youre talking about we feel like were not involved in kind of not that much involved in market level large syndicated deals we have a lot of really good longterm relationships with private equity sponsors we tend to play in areas that have repeatable protectable predictable cash flows like our technology group like our data center and infrastructure group like our healthcare and healthcare services group so they tend to be companies that during normal cycles actually have predictable cash flow and obviously during the pandemic those did well we dont do a lot of covenant life like transactions and you are right to say that one of the benefits are in these deals is there is a lot of cash and equity underneath your senior debt so it takes a real paradigm shift in any companys performance to have that private equity firms say hey were out of here or we want to give you the keys and so weve tend to work with these private equity firms for literally more than years in some cases and have a really good relationship where the senior debt and the equity work to get a great outcomes and so it is enterprise reliant it doesnt have hard collateral underneath it and i think thats why sometimes the markets always ask the question but i think weve had a long and durable time to kind of validate our strategies and underwriting in that area and again its of a billion loan portfolio so its also rightsized i believe where we are david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc very helpful thank you and then shifting over to you guys spoke about the usdf consortium i was curious can you talk to the opportunity there particularly on that deposit front john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure let me take a step back so were excited about this innovations group we have a great leader there in bea ordonez the former cfo of sterling and the group were looking at a number of things there in terms of banking as a service including the direct bank activities and this consortium around distributed ledger and blockchain the reality is from an analyst perspective its not a significant drag on expenses and we dont really have any builtin revenue in the shortterm what our goal is ultimately is i guess twofold which is to help to augment our existing businesses through digital strategies and the like obviously to look to continue to digitize consumer and retail banking try and discover an effective and efficient way to get to new profit pools and then for example on the consortium and distributed webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 ledger applying through a lot of use cases so you could think of endtoend process in correspondent mortgage or you can think of trading and storing loans on chain you could think of 24hour cheap effective and efficient payment strategies as it relates specifically to the consortium theres going to be a little bit of a slow walk as we work with the other banks as we work with the technology providers and we work with the regulators quite frankly on kind of moving forward so its all of those use cases i just mentioned but the expectations are that we wont see immediate direct benefit just because of kind of the nature of the development of the technology the figuring out all the risk aspects and also working through the regulatory landscape so a lot of exciting things that we think will benefit us and beyond but from a perspective its not factored into our financial statements david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks very much operator our next question is from mattew breese with stephens incorporated please proceed mattew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt mattew breese q analyst stephens inc i want to go to the nii guide the billion for the year given expectations for higher rates and the asset sensitive balance sheet could you help me with the exit rate of core nii in the fourth quarter it feels like it should be north of million but curious with your thoughts and maybe you can help me hone that down glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp youre looking for the exit rate of net interest income in the fourth quarter mattew breese q analyst stephens inc exactly glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah so im not going to be real prescriptive but it is in the range slightly above the range of million so i would say in the range of million to million ill use that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 mattew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay and then what are the blended new loan yields youre putting on the books today commercial real estate traditional ci and then oppositely have you started to feel any pressure even exception base pricing on the deposit front at all john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp so on the deposits not really maybe a few select circumstances on the government side but otherwise no thats easy ill take that the second question first and then the first question is on rates and spreads and its always been for i think both legacy organization we try and remain pretty disciplined but there is some variability as you go through the different asset classes so i would say im looking at commercial real estate high quality institutional commercial real estate being done ph l175 to l3 in the range obviously on sponsor specialty we talked about youre getting much higher yields on some of those leveraged loans so when we talk about originations in any one given quarter its usually based upon kind of what the mix is in that quarter obviously its very competitive out there but weve not seen dramatic rate compression we saw some before the pandemic it kind of evened out and while it is very competitive were still able to meet our return on capital hurdles on these loans and it really is just a question of in which loan category in which business were booking them and obviously the ones that have lower yields are the ones that have better risk ratings and so the capital allocation is lower mattew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then the last one from me is just more out of curiosity you said you were going to reduce corporate square footage by is that predominantly the double headquarter or sterlings legacy headquarters or could you just frame for us what the corporate square footage is and how much in the way of cost savings is from that john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think its around million on an annualized basis and it really is not related to either exiting markets or changing headquarters were actually we have more people in our waterbury headquarters than we did before we moved our official headquarters and were kind of rejiggering where everybody is we have multiple locations in new york that well consolidate in terms of the overlap between the two banks and that is really just reduction in square footage in a lot of our markets in terms of taking less space in an existing building or moving to a more efficient building because of the future of work because we have a hybrid model going forward and because were using kind of a campus model where people are going into different offices and a lot of our call center activities matt were in the process one of the things were trying to do from an efficiency perspective we have basically working through an hsa bank call center a legacy sterling call center and a legacy webster call center and even before the merger all of those call centers have started to move significantly remote which is an industry trend so were also able to reduce sort of big footprint office space housing call centers over time webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 mattew breese q analyst stephens inc great well i appreciate it thank you thats all i had john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks matt operator operator instructions our next question is from laurie hunsicker with compass point please proceed laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc i wanted to go back to jareds question on aoci john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yes laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc can you tell me what is the actual dollar aoci lost if youre billion of equity glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp sure so it was two aftertax loss of million unrealized loss laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc right got it glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp and the way i would look at it laurie is but i would just reiterate i mean this is a lot of talk about this and im not sure that were as concerned as maybe some of you are were coming from a tangible common equity spot of for every basis point immediate shock to the curve basis point you can expect it would probably impact the tangible common equity ratio by basis points so if you put that in perspective you got webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 basis point rate shock basis point shock you would still be above on your tangible common equity ratio so i think understand the concerns and i understand the talk about it but were not as concerned about it to be honest with you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp and from the economic perspective obviously that rate increase would on the revenue side would help us significantly glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp exactly laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc right no i hear you i hear you your deposits obviously just became more valuable its only marking one tiny piece but obviously we follow it because we look at tangible books just wanted to get clarity on that on net interest margin net interest income and i appreciate all the slides and the clarity youve given i just want to make sure that i have got this right so your guide on accretion income for the full year is million of which million was in the first quarter dropping to million in the second quarter did i hear that right john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp you did glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp and i will just add laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp this is spread out based on schedules based on contractual the loan if theres prepayments and stuff like that so therell be lumpiness in this you can expect that thats for sure laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah absolutely i appreciate the guide okay so just putting that together so again it was basis points on your headline margin this quarter john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc and next quarter it dropped to basis points on your john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp exactly laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc headline margin john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp exactly laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc is that right okay john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp no that reconciled laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc and then just extrapolating then your million to million youre falling to million to million or so per quarter by the third and fourth quarter so then thats going to be a basis point or so john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc basis point okay okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp i think by the fourth quarter so let me just i think by the fourth quarter my calculation is its probably about basis points in accretion somewhere between basis points and basis points laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 somewhere between okay thats super helpful okay and then ppp fees what was that this quarter in terms of dollar amount of net interest income glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp so it was million laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and do you know how much youve got remaining of glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp i think its million left in balances which will run off probably just even in the second quarter so we should be through it all by then laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay so you probably have just about million or million left of ppp fees is that enough glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah its very small very small laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great great okay and then on fee income can you talk to us a little bit about well just two questions first just specifically on boli i was looking at that i know sterlings got a higher boli than you was there some sort of drop pro forma or theres some sort of mark or anything like that glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp no no no theres no mark there if youre looking you should not see a change i mean theres no adjustment there laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay okay okay great and then on fee income could you just comment a little bit about nsfod fees how much that was in the quarter how youre approaching a more customerfriendly change to that when we could see timing and when we could see that maybe impact the noninterest income line glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp sure i mean like the rest of the industry obviously were working as we combine the two banks and integration on harmonizing the product set so were actually working on creating a product thats obviously consumer friendly and meets consumer needs and is consistent with everyone else in the industry i would say it will not webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 have an impact in the other important thing to recognize is that our total aggregate od fees are less than of revenue so less than million across the two organizations and so i think youll see that go down over time as we roll out new products but it wont have a material impact on our financial performance and it wont have really any impact on our financial performance in john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp i mean let me just double back on some because i may have misunderstood your question on volume when youre looking at the income statement from our press release because that would only have two months of sterling in it and that could laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc right john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp so thats probably indiscernible okay i thought you were looking at the balance sheet laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc no i was looking at the income statement you know what maybe i grabbed the sterling number wrong ill go back and look at that john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp okay laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc so theres no change to that john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp okay laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc and then on the odnsf piece i just want to make sure i heard that right so thats running on a combined basis for both of you at about million annually is that right glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah in aggregate webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc in aggregate okay perfect great and then just one last question for me this is small obviously your credit is looking so great your gross commercial charge offs gross not net of million was such a jump from last quarter and from what its been running last quarter was was most of that sterling or was some of that vintage webster anything one specific any color around that john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah laurie i dont talk specifically about that it was one credit yeah i will say it was legacy webster and it was one commercial credit that made up the vast majority of that charge with no laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah theres no other interesting aspects or correlation in it laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then just sorry one last question here with respect to sterlings multifamily book can you just give us a little bit of color around that a little refresh it gets around billion anything youve got on ltvs if you could remind us whats rent controlled what your plans are just any color around that would be helpful thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you laurie its about billion it has a weighted average ltv at origination of and the debt service coverage ratio on average is about performing very well and generating economic profit so i dont think there are any strategic changes obviously we actually have a nice business there and well continue to originate where were opportunistic thank you laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc do you have how much is rent control there john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp i dont ill let emlen get back to you on that later glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp well get back to you webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay perfect thanks for taking all those question there john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah thank you operator and our final question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for squeezing me in john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey i only have a couple john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp anytime jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i only have a couple of questions the growth rate youre talking about john the to how much of that do you think is environmental versus the longterm potential of the company over the next couple of years i guess my question is can we see this kind of growth rate for a couple of years from the company john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thats a great question and im not look it may be simplistic because for those of you whove followed us i kind of fundamentally believe that weve got enough levers enough geographic opportunities a bunch of interesting business niches and verticals that historically weve been able to grow commercial loans which now make up the predominant portion of the balance sheet at roughly cagr and its been about six or seven years obviously in any one given quarter you saw mortgage warehouse have an impact on the annualized growth rate in the first quarter that could change but particularly this quarter on a bigger base this year we felt like all of those things remain true although the levers we can pull without having a push on risk and we have the benefit as i mentioned in my script in earlier the bigger balance sheet to at least in the shortterm kind of accelerate some growth through single point exposures webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 going forward obviously as the balance sheet gets bigger market conditions dictate it may get more challenging but i still think and my head of commercial banking is here chris motl right now and hed probably smile is that we try and say to ourselves how are we going to get close to double digits high single digits loan growth on an annualized basis so my guess is with what we have with the teams we think we can attract with the various businesses we have that in my mind at least as the leader of the company were kind of targeting commercial loan growth now sometimes on mortgage and some of the other consumer categories which are less thats not a realistic expectation because the market just wont allow which could drag down overall loan growth but i still think to should be our bogey in a normalized economic environment as we move forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then last one its a real question kind of a soft question but maybe a good way to end the call but you talked about the cultureshaping offsite and im just curious what youve learned from that what do you guys need to work on and thats serious what do you need to work on and then whats gone well so far from those activities thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its a great question i think its the hardest thing and i couldnt be more pleased and i say that i would be more guarded if i wasnt i mentioned on a couple of nondeal roadshows youre in a situation where it sucked i know that technical term it sucks to have to wait for four months from our originally anticipated close date but i think if you ask any of the executives or level two or level three folks across the organization what the silver lining was it was the fact that we had four more months to work together in terms of planning and meeting and figuring out each other and building trust and so i think that actually helped we hit the ground running ive been really pleased theres no question about the fact that itll take time to make sure that you get rid of the us versus them or people are still referring to things like legacy webster and legacy sterling but i have to tell you that weve really coalesced around what it means to be a webster banker about the behaviors we expect when we went in and i dont want to get too granular when we went into the sort of culture practice as a leadership team we realized that while we believe that all of these values were what we wanted to do we had different definitions of what those behaviors were different expectations and so we spent a lot of time saying we really need to be careful about making sure were all on the same page we all understand what were trying to accomplish we all understand the banks mission and purpose and weve come together really really solidly half my direct reports are from each of the legacy banks and i think were operating as well as either bank was operating before from a trust and collaborative perspective so well keep working it reinforcing it but i couldnt be more pleased with where we are days into this project jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks a lot guys webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2022 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster
