good morning everyone and thank you for joining us i think what our company and our associates accomplished in was nothing short of extraordinary dealing with a significant shift in the banking landscape and the termination of our planned merger weve detailed some of our highlights on slide five despite all the disruption this year our preprovision net revenue was essentially flat to the prior year we saw the benefit from our assetsensitive balance sheet with the margin expanding basis points versus this offset the decline in revenue from our countercyclical businesses demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model most of you heard me say that we manage our company with three top priorities in mind safety and soundness profitability and growth you saw the benefit of that when our balance sheet was wellpositioned to weather the crisis of a few banks this spring this prudent balance sheet management enabled us to better serve our clients and strategically expand market share we grew both loans and deposits at significantly higher rates than the industry as a whole supported by our exceptionally strong capital levels our deposit growth was kickstarted by our second quarter campaign we raised over billion of new to bank customer funds and we have retained of that money as of yearend we have long tenure deep relationships with our clients and were excited to continue to deliver on the ph promo to primacy efforts with the clients we acquired in we have some of the financial highlights for you on the quarter of financial highlights for the quarter on slide six we delivered adjusted eps of per share or preprovision net revenue of million resulting in a return on tangible common equity of we grew the net interest margin basis points from the third quarter as we improved our asset pricing and balance sheet mix we anticipate the continued expansion into the first quarter as we successfully normalize pricing on our promotional deposits reducing our interestbearing deposit cost by approximately basis points at the end of the quarter we generated basis points of common equity tier capital this quarter bringing us to at yearend as i reflect on im incredibly thankful for the dedication of our associates as they continue to deliver value for our clients communities and shareholders with that ill hand the call over to hope to run through our financial results in more detail hope hope dmuchowski senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you bryan good morning on slide you will find our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter we generated preprovision net revenue of million this quarter net interest income grew million from third quarter benefiting from asset repricing and our ability to improve the funding mix this expanded the margin by basis points from the prior quarter we expect to build upon this momentum into first quarter which will benefit from our deposit pricing efforts in late fourth quarter fees excluding deferred comp were flat linkedquarter benefiting from higher fixed income which was offset by the timing of a couple discrete items as expected expense excluding deferred comp were up million driven by higher variable compensation tied to revenue and increased strategic investments in the quarter which we expect to moderate in first quarter first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 provision expense was million this quarter increasing acl coverage by basis points which was largely driven by modest deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios used for cecl modeling primarily within commercial real estate and consumer tangible book value per share increased to on slide we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by per share fourth quarter notable items include the fdic special assessment of million a pretax gain of million from the net of a small opportunistic fhn financial asset disposition and equities valuation adjustments additionally we had one notable tax item a million discrete benefit primarily attributable to the resolution of mergerrelated tax items related to the iberiabank merger on slide you will see that our margin expanded basis points from the prior quarter to improving nii by million fourth quarter benefited from a full three months of the rate hike that occurred in july which improved asset yields we were also able to use customer deposits and excess cash to pay down a significant amount of brokered deposits improving our funding profile the average rate paid on those brokered deposits was though the impact of fourth quarter was modest our success in repricing the promotional deposits gathered in our second quarter campaign will benefit margin as we head into as you can see on slide weve been successful in executing our deposit strategy this year periodend deposits are up yeartodate compared with a decline in the feds h8 data retention of the promotional deposits acquired in the second quarter campaign has been exceptional so far at those promotional rate guarantees expired late in fourth quarter and we were able to reprice those deposits down by an average of basis points this strong retention allowed us to pay down billion of highercost brokered deposits though were continuing to see some rotation out of noninterestbearing weve been able to acquire just under billion of new tobank interestbearing accounts at a blended cost of which is down from the acquisition rate we saw in the third quarter the interestbearing rate paid of this quarter was essentially flat to the prior quarter rates peaked in october and came back down as the promotional accounts were repriced in the back half of the quarter the endofperiod rate on interestbearing deposits declined to approximately while the total deposit rate fell to roughly we expect this to provide upside to nii and margin next quarter we have an overview of loans on slide our strong capital position and ability to grow deposits supported yeartodate loan growth loan demand softened in the fourth quarter with periodend loans declining from the prior quarter about half of that decline was due to typically seasonality of loans to mortgage companies this business experiences some seasonality tending to peak in the third quarter then decrease until hitting first quarter lows ci production was fairly muted as we entered into the quarter though we saw that stabilizes a bit in the back half of the quarter cre growth continues to be driven by fundups from existing loans primarily in multifamily and as you would expect total commitments have come down slightly as theres not a lot of new production in that sector consumer balances are relatively flat as were focused on using the balance sheet for customers like our medical doctor program where we continue to build deeper relationships we are continuing to improve pricing with spreads on new loans increasing basis points since last quarter and basis points yearoveryear on slide you can see that fee income excluding deferred comps remain stable at million our fixed income business saw an increase of million as the markets expectations that the fed has finished raising rates brought some participants back into the market mortgage revenue was down million largely due to seasonally lower volume brokerage income increased million driven by higher annuity sales card and digital banking fees were down million driven by a methodology adjustment on interchange rebates resulting in a onetime impact to fourth quarter lastly other noninterest income declined million mostly due to elevated fhlb dividends in third quarter as well as a modest reduction in boli revenue first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 on slide we show that excluding deferred compensation adjusted expenses are up million personnel excluding deferred comp was up million from last quarter with a couple of drivers first there is about million of incremental incentives in our variable revenue businesses driven by higher production this quarter we also accrued million of additional expense primarily related to the retention awards as the stock price rose almost this quarter lastly medical expenses were up million linked quarter due to seasonality and a couple of large onetime claims moving on to our strategic investments you can see the technology investments entering the run rate in occupancy and equipment ph there should continue to be modest growth here as we make progress bringing these projects online outside services increased this quarter driven by a couple of items marketing was elevated from seasonality and sponsorship and client events that typically occur in fourth quarter as well as the impact of some of the delayed costs we mentioned last quarter primarily related to client acquisition and brand campaigns we initiated in late third quarter we also engaged additional thirdparty resources for consulting and resource augmentation on key projects fourth quarter had elevated expenses due to these items that will moderate next quarter expenses will stabilize as costs and technology investments increase throughout but are offset by lower retention expense and other operational efficiencies ill cover asset quality reserves on slide loan loss provision was million this quarter down from million in third quarter which includes a million idiosyncratic credit loss last quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points across multiple industries and sectors the acl coverage ratio increased basis points to driven by marginal deterioration in the macroeconomic scenarios used for cecl modelling primarily in cre and consumer as well as modest grade migration we continue to see credit migration but we are not seeing any specific pockets of stress and what we are observing in this environment feels manageable on slide you can see that we have continued to build on our strong capital levels we generated basis points of cet1 this quarter bringing us to adjusting for their marks on our security portfolio and loan book our pro forma cet1 ratio would be total capital remained strong reaching this quarter tangible book value per share was increasing driven by from lower marktomarket impact and of net income partially offset by of dividends on slide we reiterated the outlook we gave you in december we expect to grow preprovision net revenue from levels as our ability to generate revenue more than offset our strategic investments and we continue to look for operational efficiencies to offset rising costs our interest rate outlook assumes four rate cuts with the first cut occurring in may given our ability to reduce funding costs continued asset repricing and modest balance sheet growth we expect net interest income to exceed levels fee income improvement will be driven by a modest rebound in the countercyclical businesses the expense outlook includes continued progress on the strategic technology investments as well as a modest amount of incremental investment in personnel including the annual merit adjustment that went into effect at the beginning of the year the net chargeoff guidance reflects continued macroeconomic uncertainty as we have previously communicated we do not see a need to continue to build incremental capital giving us the opportunity to deploy capital in excess of that cet1 target i will wrap up on slide we have shown you this slide several times this year and bryan opened with a version of it that listed a few of the things that this team accomplished in it is remarkable to reflect on everything that occurred this year and when i look at this slide im proud of everything the company did to serve our clients amidst significant industry disruptions and uncertainty to deliver on the expectations we laid out during investor day in second quarter to recap our investor day guidance for net interest income was a growth range of to with actual growth coming in at similarly our fee income guidance was a decline between and with actual fees down lastly we gave an expense growth range of to first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 at we came in favorable to that guidance as we found efficiencies to offset other investments despite a challenging environment our dedicated bankers delivered on our commitment to clients and our diversified business model producing consistent preprovision net revenue yearoveryear in which we anticipate building on in we have a strong balance sheet which weathered the challenges the banking industry faced earlier this year sorry earlier last year demonstrating our ongoing commitment to safety and soundness first as always we stay focused on our clients communities and associates which result in strong client and associate retention we are well positioned to capitalize on 160year legacy and i am excited to continue to demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our franchise in and beyond and with that ill give it back to bryan d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you hope our results reflect the strength of our franchise and im incredibly proud of everything our associates accomplished this year their commitment to serving our clients enabled us to navigate an uncertain environment and come out of the other side stronger i continue to remain confident that this company has the people the clients and the dedication to build an unparalleled banking franchise in the south my expectation for is much like with all thats going on in the world the economy continues to perform well and it still looks like a soft landing is possible thank you to our associates for all that you have done for our company our clients and communities and our shareholders in bruno we can now open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we do have our first question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets jon you may proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thank you good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah maybe a question for you hope on the net interest income outlook you made some comments on performance against your guidance and i just i wanted to ask about the nii outlook range and curious first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 what kind of an impact do the four cuts have on your net interest income and margin outlook and what kind of puts and takes do you have for getting the company to the kind of the lower end to the higher end of the range thanks hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks jon appreciate the question and good to hear from you in as we look at i know i think guidance out there from other different rate scenarios we did use a four rate cut scenario so the biggest impact in that range is how many cuts do we get and when so our first loan is in may it happens later in the year than that we would have a benefit to our margin the biggest factor that we need that we have that in the range when we look at a couple of different scenarios is how quickly can we reprice down those client deposits weve shortened the duration of the promo rates and the deepening rates that we have as our anticipation would be that as we saw rates decrease we quickly would be able to offset that in our funding costs jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so its safe to say if were less than youre probably at the higher end of that range if were at were mid to lower end is that fair hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thats correct jon and also we could be on the higher range higher end of the range with if we can bring down deposit pricing quicker with the rate decreases jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee depends on what that lag is jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc got you on that and then just yeah okay and overall thoughts on loan growth for i was looking for it in here and i think i may have missed it somewhere but how are you feeling about overall loan growth expectations d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee jon this is bryan we feel pretty good about loan growth expectations we expect to see the balance sheet grow so we think as i said in my closing comments that the economy is still growing consistently with the end of financial conditions have sort of ebbed and flowed but id say overall theyre still on the tight side and i expect that loan growth will be more muted this year as a result of that our balance sheet benefits a little bit from the spring loaded nature ie we have some fund up of some commitments for construction et cetera that was set up a couple of years ago or originated a few years ago and we feel very very good about the opportunities were first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 seeing were being very selective and the opportunities that we choose to put on our balance sheet so we expect a little bit of modest growth but we dont expect it to be outsized given our outlook for the economy now to sort of go back to comments that hope was making about the margin our modeling is just based on taking a forward curve thats implied in the market at some point in time it could have been ph on december its moving around a whole lot which tells you theres a fair amount of uncertainty about what interest rate will actually do and the feds comments were interpreted as pretty significant cuts and the market implies we dont i personally dont feel that strongly that the feds going to cut rates early in the year i think rates are going to hold up better or higher than the markets expectations right now but i wouldnt substitute our judgment for the market so we just use a market curve that ultimately reflects what is a slowing economy and interest rates coming down jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats helpful im more in your camp bryan but the framework you provided helps so thank you for that d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee sure operator our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james michael your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to go to the slide in the appendix as it relates to fhn financial i appreciate you guys putting that in there you guys had a nice uptick in adrs this quarter certainly understand the way this business works but can you just give us kind of what your baseline expectation is for adrs as we kind of move through the year assuming your rate cut expectations and then what it could look like in your estimation if we move a little bit slower thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah fhn is as you just implied very sensitive to what interest rates do we did see a little pickup in the fourth quarter of this year and that was really based on the market reaching a conclusion that the fed had reached peak rates and that were more likely to see rates falling and falling rates tend to be good for our fixed income business our expectations are for somewhat slightly higher average daily revenue next year we think the markets will continue to stabilize and improve particularly if it follows the path market follows the path that is sort of laid out in terms of rate cuts next year we dont expect that fhn financial is going to bounce back to levels but we do expect some modest improvement next year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats helpful and maybe just as my followup question just assuming that i just want to get a sense for how much flex there would be in the expense base if the revenues dont necessarily come through for instance like first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 is there some technology costs that you could maybe push out or what other areas could you look to maybe kind of address the revenue expectations coming at the lower end of expectations thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah yeah our expense base at fhn financial is very heavily tied to revenue ie we have a system that is scalable cost with scalable revenue our team has done i think a fantastic job in controlling costs and even when you reach the lows in the cycle we still make money in the business and clearly its not as profitable indiscernible higher points in the cycle in terms of average daily revenue but weve got the ability to control those costs and we will flex them and we expect that no matter how low adr is likely to drop in the near term we think we can eke out profitability even at the lowest levels and with some expectation for higher adrs we expect to be in a much better position through the course of michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc bryan i appreciate that color i meant holistically for the firm not just fhn financial d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee oh okay michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc sorry for if that wasnt clear d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no but well yeah so expense levels are something that we have acknowledged that we have most control over its something that we will stay focused on we have demonstrated over a number of years the ability to control costs and take our costs out of the organization in terms of the levers that are at hand we think we have a number of levers and in terms you mentioned specifically technology costs and while were investing in technology we think those investments are important particularly the what i described as deferred maintenance or remedial investments from last year there were some things that we had ph that get caught up so thats a potential lever but its not one i expect us to pull our overall cost consciousness and the effort we have in the organization i think gives us the ability to control costs as we sort of move through an environment if revenues dont play out the way we expect so again i think that overall cost consciousness will serve us well in michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate the color thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no my pleasure and sorry i misinterpreted the first time first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 operator our next question comes from casey haire from jefferies casey your line is now open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone quick followup on nii specifically the funding side of things so first off is the billion deposit promotion is that fully rolled over and then what kind of deposit beta are you expecting along these four cuts hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning casey good to hear from you in yes we are fully through that repricing of the second quarter promo campaign and that retention is a uptodate number as of yesterday and so its not a december number it is an uptodate number of what weve seen the retention on that through the cycle when we think about deposit rate rising it through the cycles when do you start cutting rates and wed probably be right around if we see a may cut we would end our beta cycle about if it got later in the year the first cut and the cycle continued we do think that we can continue to moderate by bringing in client deposits paying down a little bit more on the wholesale as well as we mentioned in my prepared remarks we saw a fourth quarter newtobank money at a significantly lower cost than we saw the prior quarter so we are seeing the ability to step back not just existing money and retain it but also bring new money in about billion and each of the last two quarters got lower rate than we saw in the second quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and just as a followup trying to gauge buyback appetite its at cet1 at youre comfortably above your target you do mention organic capital deployment but it doesnt seem like i mean to bryans point loan growth sounds kind of muted is there it just seems like you guys are being a little vague on the buyback given the strength do you manage cet1 back to that level or are you going to run above that d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah casey this is bryan at this point we dont have an authorization with respect to share repurchases i expect that thats one of many things that the board will evaluate when we work through sort of our continued outlook for the remainder of the year and so it is one of the tools that we will consider but ultimately thats a board decision that gets made in the context of safety and soundness outlook on the economy and so we expect to have those discussions and again thats one of the leverage we think that is on the table to manage that capital level operator the next question comes from ben gerlinger from citi ben your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ben hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i was curious if we could talk through i know its just kind of more philosophical in nature but for the cd campaign you obviously got a lot more money coming in than previously expected or at least kind of what the implication was so from that i get that theres a retention but how much of that is actually turning into new business ie something along the line of the income line item or bringing over a relationship in general in terms of a lending opportunity d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah in terms of the retention the retention has been very very good and our bankers are i think executing very very well on what were referring to as ph promo to primacy and while it is still early we think we are making good progress in taking those newtobank relationships and broadening and expanding those relationships and that doesnt happen instantaneously but we see early indications that are encouraging benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and then is that embedded in anything or is that kind of just icing on the cake for if they start to bring over wealth or something like that d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee but inherently thats embedded in our estimates of fee income and net interest margin so yeah inherently it is embedded but theres not a specific addon at this point in terms of the way we manage our forecasting and budgeting benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and then lets completely switch gears here in terms of just lending appetite i guess theres so many competitors here in southeast are they pulling back or reorganizing or something that might have them take their eye off the ball are you seeing additional client add potential just from a commercial perspective if you could highlight any areas within any lending category where youre seeing better riskadjusted spreads or conversely kind of shying away because it really just doesnt make a lot of sense i get office is an easy low hanging fruit to call out but if theres anything more granular than that would be helpful d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 yeah ill start then ask susan to sort of pick up we sort of get varying degrees of information and a lot of it is anecdotal i would say in the middle of and in the early fall you saw more people actually pulling back from the markets in terms of lending appetite and getting out of lines of businesses which we think created a number of opportunities for us in things like mortgage warehouse finance and mortgage warehouse lending and restaurant finance and things of that nature the markets seemed to stabilize a little bit as you got into late and whether that was the feds essentially loosening financial conditions by talking about the picking of rates and potential for rate cuts being the topic of the market seems to have stabilized a little bit in terms of lending appetite it has probably gotten a bit more competitive therere one or two examples of folks who are not taking new or newtobank relationships that are now back into the market so it ebbs and flows all of that said we feel very good about the opportunities that we are seeing we try to execute with a very consistent and steady gotomarket approach we try not to pull into and out of markets based on whats happening in the next or days by our estimate and essentially what we believe is is how we conduct ourselves in those periods of volatility are the things that define us for the next years with our clients and our customers so weve literally tried to just be very steady and very stable and as a result i think we continue to see a number of attractive opportunities its not a high volume because the economy doesnt support that but were very encouraged by what were seeing in the market susan susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i agree with what bryan was saying and we do take it through the cycle approach and bryan says we try not to have the pendulum swing too much either way when times are really good or when things are a little slower and more challenging like they are today with the higher interest rate environment we want to be there for our clients and communities and we have there and there were some instances this year where we were able to step up for existing clients when others were not but it is a market where were able to get good core underwriting metrics good structures and some good risk adjusted returns on the pricing as well so again we want to be there for clients we also do think i think there are some opportunities in our specialty lines as well as in our markets to take some generational opportunities potentially away from some competitors who might be having some kind of disruption in their ability to execute benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats really helpful color ill actually email hope i have a couple of just real small modelling questions but ill fall back in the queue thanks d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee all right thank you ben operator our next question comes from brady gailey from kbw brady your line is now open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys i wanted to start on the credit quality fraud last quarter we saw a little blip with the shared national credit loss this quarter we saw npas increase by about theyre still on a relatively low level but maybe just updated thoughts on it feels like credit is normalizing here but just updated thoughts on how youre thinking about credit into first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee hi brady its susan ill take that we are being as i just said on the answer to the last question very disappointed in our approach and we have been for years and so i do believe that that this disciplined approach to client selection the fact the markets that were in are very strong will continue to serve us well as you pointed out weve had some downgrades into nonperforming and classified but its very manageable at this point were not seeing any specific things related to markets industries product types at all we did a lot of deep dive work in well continue that in we do it really do it all the time especially in the higher interest rate environment were making sure that were touching look touching the portfolio and even at a higher level where more executive management is involved in portfolio reviews so i feel very good about the fact that weve got discipline in how were grading and servicing credit so i think the outlook is one where we will perform well our eyes on the ball and will continue to be conservative both at origination but also in how we think about grading and marking our lens each and every quarter brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then first horizon is about billion in assets now so you still have some time until growth takes you to billion but maybe just an updated thoughts on how youre preparing for that or what you think the impact will be and when you think first horizon could see that billion mark organically d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee brady good morning the way were preparing is were practicing treading water right now yeah we think at the end of the day that we have some flexibility in terms of managing the balance sheet and while its not clear what the coming billion in ph lfi entails and particularly with the proposals that are out on basel iii so were taking the time to understand that and to navigate through it some aspects of it were likely to have to deal with earlier particularly if the final rule gets issued on resolution planning for billion to billion organizations some of those things will start to work their way into the system but right now were studying what becoming an alibi looks like were preparing the groundwork for it but at the end of the day were not going to just stumble across billion and we have a few years of flexibility and as ive alluded to the ability to tread water and keep our balance sheet at a level that doesnt push us over a bright line threshold accidentally brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right great thanks guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from timur braziler from wells fargo timur your line is now open first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thank you maybe a followup to bradys credit quality question just any color on what the increase in non performers was in the fourth quarter hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah it was really we had several different industries reflected on the top kind of four that were added you had one thats kind of an online retailer we had one cre hotel project that was added and then a couple of other just kind of general ci credit was kind of the drivers of the bigger drivers of the increase one was a and then one franchise financed restaurant credit d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee it looks to us like as we seek the credit portfolios performing that its still largely driven by idiosyncratic trends as opposed to broadbased this category of asset or that category of asset so what im really sort of suggesting is borrowers that start in a more stressed position more levered inability to take price higher cost pressures interest rates are getting some thats stressing some borrowers more than its stressing others and so were not seeing broadbased trends in the portfolio right now were as susan said were spending a lot of time doing deep dives and analytics but at the end of the day the trends seem to be driven by more idiosyncratic stories than anything susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah as an example the hotel project that we added experienced some construction delays and so theyre just a little behind on where we thought they would be according to plan so thats an example like bryan said where it was related to something not necessarily industryrelated and the others would have similar stories of kind of one off situations timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for that and then going back to expenses and the technology spend specifically i think the commentary prior had been around million in technology spend over the next three years can you provide maybe some greater clarity on the cadence of that spend is that pretty even over the next three years or some of that remedial spend as you called out is that something thats going to be maybe a little bit more forward skewed hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee timur thanks for the question technology spend tends to be kind of the backloaded and so as the project is gearing up youre capitalizing costs software doesnt go into maintenance yet and so it is a little bit more back loaded we started to as we talked about in q3 kind of undershooting our expenses in the quarter weve seen that hit in q4 those projects have started up and i said in my prepared remarks we expect at the back half of next year we will see those costs increase and then increase going into as the bulk of what we started in the second half of this year starts to hit the run rate indiscernible and that being said we are as we continue to say looking at operational efficiency just to figure out how we can offset some of that investment first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 but we do expect in we expect that in the back half of the year were going to offset on a pl basis the increased technology spend with the retention dollars that are running off that we have somewhat flat expenses throughout the year and well continue to focus on looking at how we do that timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color and then one more if i could just on the promo deposits rolling off that retention is impressive at i guess what did those borrower or those clients roll into are those back in cds did that move to money market and i guess what is the current cd specials out there right now for you guys hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee that was all money market that repriced in q4 our cds were actually ph a or on cds but were not as material indiscernible in q2 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee those rates were down basis points from the special rates hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee the second part of your question was what was the current offers so our current offer is a deepening relationship of ph and so as youre coming off promo if you bring more money to the bank you deepen your relationship with us the offer is ph you can see we ended up at about basis points down so weve gotten pretty far to kind of that ph right theres always some negotiation in the discussion but we believe that overall that ph is the target for new money coming in timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks hope operator our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott christopher your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning just one more further question for susan do you think that the ci specifically would see some deterioration this year or should this quarter still kind of stay intact susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee hey i think that chris the interest rate outlook of kind of stable rates may be going down again i think youll see mostly stability as well based on the fact that weve done a deep dive of portfolio overviews really throughout different sectors ci increase im not i feel like weve got things graded in the right place were continuing to first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 talk to clients were stressing doing stress projections in the underwriter service credit and so i think absent some things really changing in the economy if it were to worsen obviously wed take another look and it could impact clients but based on what we know today i feel good about kind of a stable outlook at this point based on what were seeing now christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you for that and then bryan for you do you think well see consolidation in the industry this year and is there a scenario where first horizon would be interested in buying other banks even something small to fill in in the footprint d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning chris i think you might see consolidation start to pick up later in the year i dont think that its going to be a robust environment personally i think theres still a tremendous number of headwinds the purchase accounting mark being the largest at this point and then i think some of the uncertainty around what the regulatory landscape looks like both in the context of what it takes to get the deal approved and how long that takes as well as what does it mean if you deal with some of the bright lines like billion in the ph lfi so i dont expect a tremendous amount of pickup during the course of this year in terms of first horizon our priorities are executing on the things that weve talked about and thats dealing with the investments we want to make in technology and continuing to grow customer and client relationships if you look backwards we had spent roughly three years maybe closer to four depending on how you counted in the merger of equals integration and then the pretermination period so we really want to use this period of to continue to prove out the power of the franchise that weve built and we think we have plenty of opportunity to deploy capital there christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great bryan thanks for sharing that i appreciate it d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee sure thing operator our next question comes from brody preston from ubs brody your line is now open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted to circle back on the buyback commentary bryan if i heard you correctly you said you dont have an authorization and youre expecting to discuss it with the board i guess id ask when is your next board meeting and will it get addressed at that board meeting d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee well as a matter of fact our next board meeting is next week so we always cover financial outlook capital management our capital outlook with our board so thats a meeting to meeting thing i dont want to prognosticate what the board is likely to do or not do at our next meeting but capital management is one of those things that we always spend time on we think about it from the context of adequate capital as we stress test our balance sheet and we continue to do that and report it publicly so i dont want to get into what the board may or may not consider next week but its always a topic in terms of our balance sheet and financial outlook brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc understood hope maybe i could ask you could you speak to the noninterestbearing mix thats underlying the nii guidance that you provided hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee brody we do have a small you know so nii got the small increase in noninterest bearing for we went out pretty aggressively at the end of q4 and starting in q1 with a newtobank cash offer for new checking accounts we havent done that before and so we are seeing some positive momentum which i had in my prepared remarks but i wouldnt say its meaningful brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and what does it take it to pay off further further pay down broker deposits is it an ability to grow other deposit sources or would you look to kind of pay down some of that with the securities cash flows that you have on a quarterly basis hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee the answer is yes to all of that we want to continue to bring client money in to offset our loan growth we do have loan growth projections next year and so we are focused on it and you saw us have large push in q4 on the marketing front as we get into or q4 as we get into and we have paused reinvestment on securities portfolio we used our securities portfolio to hedge your interest rate sensitivity were happy where were at and expect that that cash flow will continue to come back for us number one is creating client deposits so we can lend them to clients and if we have to be a little bit in brokered for that we will be so the bigger thing for us when we look at brokered going into is the mortgage warehouse as you look at the seasonality of there first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2024 you can possibly see some brokers have to come back in and then out the next quarter but being our highest yielding asset and being shortterm on the balance sheet it is a great target for us brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then one last one for me and im sorry if you totally addressed this question i think somebody asked about it a little earlier was just on that spot deposit cost is that where we bottom out unless we get rate cuts or will it incrementally decline from that level in the first quarter as the last of the promo stuff kind of rolls off hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee were anticipating it to decline in q1 modestly we do have additional brokered we can pay off that was laddered out if you look at our cash balance at the end of the quarter the bigger piece will be what is indiscernible back in q1 right so we pay down brokered with the excess money when it comes due or we put it into loan growth but i would say is definitely brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee the high point and well be bringing it back down till we see rate decrease we do believe weve hit the peak of our betas last quarter and that will continue to bring it down again not meaningful but basis point here and there each quarter is what were targeting brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it all right thank you very
