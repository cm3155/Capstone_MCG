executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks heather and thank you everybody for joining us this morning let me begin with page of our strategic update presentation im pleased to report that was a year of strong performance for goldman sachs as we successfully navigated an unexpected operating backdrop characterized by nearrecord volatility and correspondingly high client activity this year was marked by an extraordinary decline in economic activity in the second quarter brought on by covid19 and a dramatic reversal in the third and fourth quarter as economic output and unemployment partially reversed course this volatility contributed to severe dislocation across asset classes which was met by profound fiscal and monetary action taken across the globe goldman sachs met the needs of our clients relying on dynamic management of the firms liquidity and balance sheet to provide complex risk intermediation financing solutions advice and innovative thought leadership momentum remained strong into yearend as we produced record revenues for the fourth quarter of billion resulting in record quarterly earnings per share of for the fullyear we grew revenue by to billion our highest revenue production in more than a decade which allowed us to generate meaningful operating leverage we delivered a fullyear roe of notwithstanding a nearly percentage point impact of litigation expense this revenue growth was clearly driven by a larger opportunity set given the extraordinary activity throughout while industry wallet grew we also took meaningful market share across businesses and geographies we continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 we maintained our leading global position in completed ma as we have for of the past years and strong league table positions in underwriting including the number one ranking in equity and equitylinked offerings and a top three ranking in high yield we delivered robust performance in global markets in both ficc and equities on solid client activity across our global platform and grew market share across businesses and client groups our next generation trading talent now in positions of leadership demonstrated strong risk management discipline and client focus in executing against an expanding opportunity set in asset management we had record management and other fees as well as continued growth in our assets under supervision we also generated solid revenues from onbalance sheet investments driven by public marks and eventdriven gains on our portfolio we continued our broader effort to reduce the balance sheet intensity of this business as we transitioned to more thirdparty investing we continue to provide high quality advice to our wealth management clients producing record revenues and generated strong growth in our consumer business finally and perhaps most importantly we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet and demonstrated agility in the deployment of capital to serve clients amid high levels of market volatility and evolving regulatory constraints while we are cautiously optimistic given improving macro trends we recognize that the operating backdrop will continue to evolve although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the us uk and other nations there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence vaccine distribution and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risks let me underscore that progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally i urge political leaders at all levels and across all jurisdictions to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan in its absence economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed economists continue to anticipate a mixed outlook for nearterm growth the expectation is that itll take until at least the second quarter to return to prepandemic levels of output our economists expect gdp growth this year of roughly both globally and in the us which would suggest a more rapid recovery though circumstances around covid19 remain fluid and we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weaknesses in the broader economy looking ahead the extreme volatility of is unlikely to repeat given the government actions taken last year nevertheless i am confident that goldman sachs will continue to benefit from the established wallet share gains made in across an expanding client set particularly in investment banking and global markets and continue to develop more durable revenue sources across asset management and consumer wealth management with that let me turn to page in the months since our investor day we have made steady progress towards our mediumterm goals and we remain confident that we will achieve these targets as well as our longer term goal of midteens or higher returns our roe when adjusted to exclude the impact of litigation comfortably exceeds our mediumterm target we are pleased with our progress on funding diversification as we grew deposits by billion in while the fed funds rate declined faster than the reduction in our deposit rates weve since adjusted our pricing which should allow us to achieve our funding optimization goals by we are making headway in realizing expense efficiencies throughout the organization and have achieved approximately half of the billion initial target we presented at our investor day we will continue to make progress from here and will evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 finally with respect to capital our cet1 ratio stands at this positions us well to serve clients and accelerate capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter we continue to believe that a to ratio is appropriate for the firm over the mediumterm we are encouraged by the results of the recent midcycle stress test that said we will continue to proactively reduce the stress capital intensity of our businesses including through continued sales of our onbalance sheet private equity investments as john stephen and i have emphasized many times we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and being transparent with our stakeholders on our progress we are tracking roughly firmwide kpis and many additional businesslevel metrics on a regular basis to measure our success as we execute on all aspects of our strategy let me now turn to page while last januarys investor day seems distant given the events of the past year the pillars of our strategic direction remain unchanged our strategy is simple first to grow and strengthen our existing franchise and capture higher wallet share across a wider client set second to diversify our products and services in order to build a more durable earnings stream and third to operate more efficiently so that we can drive higher margins and returns across the organization we are seeing early success in each category moving to page the strength of our firms culture is the foundation for our performance as individuals in the firm and is central to the success that we achieved in delivering the entire firm to our clients through our one goldman sachs approach is crucial to our mission and clients remain at the center of everything we do the investments we made to break down internal silos and motivate better collaboration across the firm have been critical and will continue to guide our approach going forward equally core to our mission is delivering on our firms purpose to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity this purpose is fundamental to our 10year billion sustainable finance commitment that cuts across two broad pillars climate transition and inclusive growth during the year we have worked closely with our clients to deepen knowledge and expertise develop capabilities and accelerate commercial activity we are delivering integrated esg solutions across our client base and im proud of the firms leadership on this topic and optimistic about the benefits that these opportunities will bring to our clients as we pursue these ambitious goals we will also continue to focus on our people diversity is an imperative for our organization for goldman sachs it is about bringing diverse people perspectives and abilities together to best serve our stakeholders it fosters more creative thinking and supports the inclusive sustainable growth that is core to our longterm business strategy while our recent progress is encouraging including the most diverse campus analyst class ever to join the firm this past summer and improved diversity of our most recent partner and managing director classes the events of the past year have reinforced how much further we have to go to enhance diversity and inclusion throughout the firm this remains a personal priority for me and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable to make further advancements including through our new aspirational goals to drive diverse hiring at more levels of the firm let me now take you through each of our four operating segments and well start with investment banking where we remain the advisor of choice for corporations around the world in as measured against the goals set out at our investor day we maintained our number one ranking in announced and completed ma and equity and equitylinked offerings we also ranked in the top four for wallet share on global debt underwritings through the third quarter we spoke last january about our aim to grow share in our core business we began to execute on this goal in as announced ma deal count was up along with our equity underwriting wallet share the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 our footprint expansion efforts on our footprint expansion efforts we have met our investor day target for client coverage we generated in excess of million of revenue in from this client set and we expect this to be an important source of growth going forward across the business we have added approximately net new clients since and we will continue to add new clients to sustain this pace we are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for investment banking given the robust activity revels in the capital markets and the elevated strategic activity on the back of improving ceo confidence reflected in our nearrecord backlog at the end of the year we are also pleased with the early success of our transaction banking platform with which since its launch last june has attracted roughly corporate clients and nearly billion of deposits and is wellpositioned to drive growth and more durable revenues for the firm the combination of our attractive product offering strong client receptivity and tailwinds created by the macroeconomic environment drove deposit growth ahead of expectations as we work to deliver greater functionality to clients and continue their onboarding we will convert more of these deposits to operational providing increased funding utility to the firm we also continue to look for innovative ways to expand the reach of our platform to new clients as we did with our recent partnership with stripe which embeds our transaction banking payment and deposit solutions directly into stripes platform making these products available to its millions of small business customers let me now turn to page in our global markets business posted its strongest net revenues in a decade exceeding the return targets laid out for the business at investor day global markets is a business that many believed should have been downsized when john stephen and i took our seats while its only a single year the performance of the business in is an early validation of our decision to stay the course our teams worked diligently to serve our clients through the challenges of providing liquidity across asset classes intermediating risk and engaging in structured solutions while also supporting significant volumes across expanding digital platforms we also advanced on our investor day objective of moving into a top three position with more of the top institutional clients we are now in the top three across of these firms up from a year ago we gained basis points of wallet share through the third quarter of which we intend to maintain through our deepened client relationships superior risk intermediation and ongoing investment in technology platforms we set a goal in january to increase our client financing activity our record ficc financing revenues for demonstrate our ability to meet this target additionally we continued to strengthen our prime business where we closed the year with record balances the result of a multiyear investment in platform enhancements and other clientoriented initiatives particularly in the quant space finally while we saw meaningful revenue growth in global markets we remain focused on operating efficiency we achieved roughly million in expense efficiencies last year and allocated billion of capital in that business to more accretive opportunities both ahead of schedule across any level of industry wallet the progress that we have made in global markets has improved the business structural return profile let me now turn to page our asset management business experienced solid performance in marked by continued growth in assets under supervision driving record management and other fees our status as one of the worlds leading global asset managers has served us well during this volatile period our asset management business provides clients with offerings across the spectrum from liquidity to alternatives and we will continue to grow this business opportunistically by serving our clients needs and differentiating our offerings with holistic advice investment solutions and portfolio implementation the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 we are progressing well towards our longer term objectives of billion of growth in traditional equity and fixed income products and billion of net inflows to alternatives to that end we spoke at investor day about growing our thirdparty alternatives business and we are pleased with our early achievements we have raised approximately billion in commitments todate across asset classes including private equity private credit and real estate this is good progress toward our goal of billion in gross fundraising over five years additionally were encouraged by the expanding number of institutions that are investing with goldman sachs many pension funds and international institutions participating in recent fund offerings are new investing clients to the firm as we shift towards a greater emphasis on thirdparty funds we also continue to work to optimize the capital consumption of our asset management business to that end we sold or announced the sale of over billion of gross equity investments in with a related billion of expected lower capital we will continue to advance the selldown process in and beyond to achieve the objectives we set out in our investor day importantly as we highlighted at investor day incentive fees on portfolio remain unrecognized until investments are sold and fund return thresholds are achieved our estimated unrecognized incentive fees currently stand at billion turning to page we made meaningful advancements this year in growing our consumer wealth management segment particularly in expanding our customer base building our technology platform and leveraging our corporate franchise we remain committed to delivering tailored advice and simple and transparent financial solutions to our individual clients across the wealth spectrum and our goals here remain integral to our strategic priorities our wealth management franchise remains a crown jewel for the firm revenues grew yearoveryear to a record billion as our clients largely remained invested through uncertain market conditions in our private wealth management business this success has long been built on the strength depth and trust of client relationships which became even more relevant as covid19 limited facetoface interaction throughout this period our private wealth advisors have continued to maintain high levels of client engagement and delivered trusted advice while the environment has caused us to slow some of our hiring efforts in this area we remain committed to the growth potential of this franchise we also continue to expand our highnetworth platform through ayco and personal financial management our rebranded united capital business our ayco platform achieved its annual goal of bringing more than new corporate clients on to the platform in as corporates of all types increasingly look to ayco for financial planning and wellness solutions we remain wellpositioned to meet this ongoing need given aycos broad spectrum of offerings as well as its connectivity with our investment banking franchise and our new personal financial management capabilities we have already begun to see significant synergies as a result of these advantages with over referrals in representing over billion of aus opportunity across these channels moving to page i want to provide some additional detail on our consumer business which continues to perform well and deliver strong growth the pandemic has reaffirmed our view that traditional banking has not kept up with the way people live their lives today and that goldman sachs is uniquely placed to step into this gap weve had early success launching online savings lending and credit card and we are now moving to the next phase of our growth plan taking us from a series of singular products to a more comprehensive offering the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 we are particularly excited about the launch of marcus invest platform in the us this quarter which for the first time brings the investing expertise of goldman sachs directly to mass affluent customers following our us launch we plan to expand to the uk in the second half of the year marcus invest will offer individuals the ability to invest as little as in our proprietary asset allocation strategies with options ph ranging from index funds to esgfocused etfs digital investing features will be integrated into the marcus app and website and will combine the accessibility simplicity and transparency of marcus with our leading investment advisory capabilities in addition our new digital checking offering also scheduled for launch this year will deliver an enhanced customer experience that is simpler and more transparent than what traditional banks have historically offered providing smart money management tools that help consumers take control of their financial lives as we grow we will not only serve customers directly through the marcus platform but we will also serve customers through our growing partnership channels in we launched four new partnerships with amazon walmart jetblue and aarp all following our first partnership with apple we also recently announced our second cobranded credit card with general motors another sign of our ability to be the banking partner of choice for leading corporations across a variety of industries our partners value our scale innovation engineering prowess robust infrastructure regulatory status and importantly the power of the goldman sachs brand the opportunity set here is very large with each partner reaching tens of millions of individuals through their existing customer bases with that as background let me also comment on consumer performance which exceeded our expectations but which also has implications for our financials as we go forward we proactively adjusted our strategy beginning in march as the impact of covid19 and the evolving market conditions began to take shape we tightened underwriting standards to reduce risk deliberately slowing our consumer loan growth across both unsecured loans and apple card given the economic outlook we also significantly grew our reserves for potential future losses at the same time we continued to raise deposits at a pace meaningfully higher than we had expected as clients remained attracted to the value of our products and the strength of our brand taken together our pretax loss in consumer excluding reserve build was reduced versus levels and lower than our expectations for looking forward we have a clear opportunity to achieve breakeven excluding reserves for existing product set including checking and investing in that achievement would be one year later than initially anticipated due to business adjustments driven by covid for pretax loss for our consumer business excluding the impact of reserves is likely to be higher and look more like what we had initially expected for this is driven by lower value on deposits tighter credit standards and additionally the investment in our new general motors credit card beyond we will continue to invest where appropriate and opportunities to build additional functionality with our digital bank as well as to pursue further growth in our partnership channel in terms of broader functionality we may look to develop additional products driving more comprehensive customer experience over time these investments if pursued may delay our planned breakeven for the business i want to emphasize however that should we choose to invest in additional products to broaden our consumer capabilities it will not affect our ability to meet our enterpriselevel targets with respect to partnerships these opportunities with corporate clients of the firm allow us to commercially engage with a broader consumer population and are designed to build on the platformbased architecture that we the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 have built for our proprietary marcus business just as we did with apple card our intent is to develop differentiated products and service offerings that are embedded in our partners ecosystems and tailored to the spending borrowing and investing needs of their customers from an economic perspective these opportunities are designed to materially reduce our customer acquisition costs and leverage the embedded cost base of our systems furthermore partnerships we seek to pursue offer the firm potential for midteens returns at scale each partnership is intended to extend beyond a single product and bring scale to our business on favorable economic terms goldman sachs has a history of building businesses with a longterm orientation our investment in our consumer business will continue to be dynamic and appropriately sized to support our ability to achieve our long term financial targets and in the interim it will not prevent us from reaching our mediumterm firmwide goals before i close let me share that im incredibly proud of the progress weve made in which was a transformative year for goldman sachs our success could not have been achieved without the extraordinary efforts of our people who continue to put clients at the center of everything we do i am humbled by the level of commitment i see across our organization every day knowing many of the personal and professional challenges our people are navigating as we look forward i know there will be further challenges but im optimistic about the potential for goldman sachs in the coming years i believe in our strategic plan in our leadership team in our culture and in the raw talent of our people taken together these attributes will better enable us to achieve higher and more sustainable returns for our shareholders let me now turn it over to stephen to review funding expenses and capital as part of the investor day update stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning let me continue the presentation on page we are pleased with the progress made todate on the diversification of our funding the achievement of our mediumterm funding goals remains a significant source of forward value for the firm as you will recall our ambition is to achieve billion in annual revenue uplift over the mediumterm from growth in deposits enhancement to our asset liability management and the optimization of our liquidity pool along with the broader industry we experienced material shift in the rate environment in with fed funds declining over basis points the relative value of our deposits remained positive but lower than projected at investor day whats more since we are modestly assetsensitive as a firm our assets repriced more quickly than our liabilities as progressed we were able to adjust our deposit pricing to reflect the broader downward movement in rates while we did not achieve savings in with greater volume and now updated pricing in the consumer channel we remain on track to achieve our billion runrate savings target we also remain wellpositioned to capture further savings as we expand our offerings in marcus deepen our client relationships and rely less on pricing as a lever for customer acquisition while the focus has been on consumer deposits our total deposits grew by billion in across multiple strategic channels including particularly strong flows in transaction banking importantly deposits comprised approximately of our total unsecured funding base at yearend in line with our mediumterm target as the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 recent environment has helped accelerate our deposit gathering efforts growth will likely be more moderate in the nearterm in light of our entity funding needs we continue to grow assets within our bank entities where we have traditionally lagged our peers we now have approximately onequarter of the firmwide balance sheet held in the firms bank entities versus roughly in we have also made improvements in our asset liability management but we continue to employ a conservative funding approach focused on term and diversification let me now move to page and expenses we remain on track to achieve the target laid out at investor day of billion in expense savings over the mediumterm accomplishing approximately half of our goal over the past year the achievement of these efficiencies has enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in our experience over the past months has given us even greater confidence in several of the key elements of this plan in particular we are already seeing important benefits from our investment in automation and consolidation of platforms including increased straightthrough processing rates and reduced cost per trade in addition we continue to generate efficiencies from structural adjustments to our employee base through our front toback realignment location strategy and evaluation of pyramid structure on the noncompensation front consolidation of offices in london and bengaluru focus on transactionbased expenses and more centralized expense management processes have all contributed to early success the remote work environment has also catalyzed an increased focus on our location strategy last january we expected that of our employees would ultimately work from one of our strategic locations and we will continue to evaluate the potential for that number to grow over time we will also look to expand into new strategic locations around the globe as well as consolidate our footprint where appropriate in keeping with our evolving business mix now turning to page and capital our capital management philosophy remains unchanged we seek to deploy capital on accretive terms both in our incumbent businesses and in areas of growth investment and otherwise return excess to our shareholders while our ratios initially declined in early as we committed capital to support clients navigating the pandemic and we received an scb result in the ccar process that was higher than anticipated our standardized cet1 ratio at yearend was accomplished through strong earnings lower capital return and disciplined balance sheet management importantly we are pleased with the results of the recent interim stress test and we intend to resume share repurchases this quarter as in the past and as permitted we will continue to reassess our dividend commensurate with the strategic direction of our business we will be dynamic in our approach both to reflect proactive steps to reduce capital consumption in the business and as a function of capital requirements more in line with the results of the interim ccar examination as such we continue to target the cet1 ratio of to over the medium term which will inform our capital deployment decisions as we look ahead we remain engaged with the federal reserve to improve stress modeling in ccar as david mentioned earlier we have already sold or announced the sale of billion in assets with billion of related capital reduction that said in the first quarter we will adjust our equity attribution across our segments to more appropriately reflect the firms higher scb based on the results of ccar given the higher stress loss intensity of our equity positions the capital attributed to asset management will be larger and so will the capital reduction associated with our intended selldown of assets this change will not the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 impact our stated mediumterm targets and in fact we intend to increase the size and accelerate the pace of asset sales beyond that anticipated at investor day so as to further reduce the capital intensity of the segment beyond our original ambition speaking more broadly there are several key drivers affecting capital requirements for the firm overall first our stress capital buffer which we expect to improve as i have noted second our gsib surcharge where we ended the year at to meet client demands the impact of which will take effect in and lastly our management buffer which we plan to run between basis points and basis points accounting for volatility and client activity before turning to our earnings report let me finish on page with a slide that david first presented at investor day one year ago our strategic direction is guided by these objectives we are pleased with our progress to date in strengthening our existing businesses growing our new businesses and operating the firm more efficiently early success in however does not diminish our focus on forward execution we have work to do from here and will continue to drive more durable earnings and enhanced returns for our shareholders in all cases we will continue our commitment to transparency and accountability and we look forward to updating you further on our progress in the year ahead with that let me now switch gears to our separate earnings presentation to cover the fourth quarter and full year results first to quickly recap our financial results on page fourth quarter net revenues were billion resulting in billion for the full year a growth rate of in the fourth quarter we delivered net earnings of billion and record quarterly earnings per share of as david mentioned the firm delivered fullyear roe of litigation burdened our full year returns by nearly basis points turning to page and our individual segments as we noted earlier investment banking delivered outstanding performance in in the fourth quarter net revenues were billion advisory revenues were billion more than double thirdquarter levels reflecting growth in the number of completed ma transactions we advised on over transactions that closed during the quarter representing over trillion of deal volume roughly billion ahead of our closest peer equity underwriting produced a record billion of revenue in the quarter as industry volumes remained elevated and we continued to gain market share this drove record fullyear revenues in equity underwriting of billion supported by billion of deal volume across nearly transactions in an extraordinary year for equity issuance we participated in traditional ipos private transactions and a number of spac ipos providing clients advice and access to capital in innovative forms turning to debt underwriting net revenues were million down sequentially reflecting lower investment grade transactions partially offset by strength in leverage finance fullyear revenues of billion were a new record and up versus our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our number high yield league table ranking for the year looking forward as david mentioned our investment banking backlog is at nearrecord levels significantly higher versus the third quarter and a year ago client dialogues remain robust and we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors including tmt fig and health care fourth quarter net revenues from corporate lending were negative million reflecting roughly million of hedge losses against the relationship loan book as credit spreads tightened recall that for risk management the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain large relationship lending commitments of note in relationship lending the total notional drawn or funded on revolvers is now back down to precovid levels moving to global markets on page net revenues were billion in the fourth quarter up versus last year for the full year global markets generated billion of net revenues up versus driven by stronger ficc and equities intermediation performance this represents the highest yearly revenues for the segment in a decade turning to ficc on page fourth quarter ficc net revenues were billion up yearoveryear our growth versus last year was driven by higher ficc intermediation revenues where we saw increased client activity while ficc financing revenues were roughly flat three out of five ficc intermediation businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year reflecting the continued strength and breadth of our business in credit we saw significantly better performance helped by elevated activity and market share gains driven in particular by outperformance in portfolio trading notably across our digital platforms in commodities net revenues were driven by stronger performance across most assets including metals and agricultural products in currencies net revenues rose on solid performance in emerging markets as volatility rose across most currency pairs in mortgages and rates net revenues were lower yearonyear though client activity remained solid particularly in mortgages around cmbs and mortgage intermediation and in rates activity remained elevated as a consequence of a number of macro events including the us election and covid and the overall reflationary theme moving over to equities net revenues for the fourth quarter were billion up versus a year ago fullyear revenues of billion were the highest since fourth quarter equities intermediation net revenues of billion reflected stronger results in derivatives across all regions as well as higher cash revenues helped by strong performance in program trading equities financing revenues of million were down yearoveryear due to higher net funding costs including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool importantly as david mentioned client balances rose to record levels moving to asset management on page our asset management activities produced net revenues of billion in the fourth quarter for the full year asset management generated net revenues of billion down from a strong as equity and debt investment performance was challenged in the first half of fourth quarter management and other fees totaled million up versus a year ago on higher average assets contributing to record fullyear net revenues of billion across the asset management segment our aus stood at a record trillion at yearend our equity investments generated billion in the fourth quarter on gains on our public and private investments more specifically on our billion public equity portfolio we generated roughly million in gains from investments including kaspi and sprout and on our billion private equity portfolio we generated net gains of approximately million from various positions substantially all of which were driven by events including corporate actions such as fundraisings capital market activities and outright sales additionally we had operating revenues of million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were million on revenues from net interest income and gains on fair value debt securities and loans this reflected tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 on page we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters on equity and cie portfolios remain highly diversified by sector geography and vintage and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with segment loans largely secured on page turning to consumer wealth management we produced billion of revenues in the fourth quarter full year net revenues were billion up versus year ago driven by higher management and other fees and strong consumer banking growth for the quarter wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of billion fullyear revenues of billion rose yearoveryear and assets under supervision rose to a record billion at yearend total client assets in the segment exceeded trillion at the end of consumer banking revenues were million in the fourth quarter contributing to fullyear revenues of billion which rose yearoveryear and were diversified across lending card and savings consumer deposits remained stable during the quarter despite an additional rate reduction ending the year at billion across the us and uk up billion versus last year funded consumer loan balances were billion of which billion were from marcus consumer loans and billion from credit card lending importantly the credit behavior of our loan and credit card portfolio outperformed our expectations the portfolio benefited from improved underwriting as well as the consequences of our consumer assistant plans next lets turn to page for firmwide assets under supervision total aus rose to over trillion during the quarter and are up nearly billion versus a year ago the sequential change was driven by billion of long term inflows billion of liquidity inflows and billion of market appreciation on page we addressed net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion in the fourth quarter up versus a year ago primarily reflecting growth in the firms balance sheet particularly in global markets as well as the benefit from credit card balances and repricing of deposits in consumer wealth management equally this activity is reflective of the decision to allow our gsib surcharge to increase to next lets review loan growth and credit performance across the firm our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion up billion sequentially largely driven by modest growth in loans in consumer wealth management and real estate warehouse lending our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was million roughly flat sequentially and down versus a year ago the quarters provisions were driven primarily by continued growth in lending in our consumer business and wholesale impairments offset by some reserve releases driven by improving macroeconomic conditions given our announced partnership with general motors and the planned acquisition of the current loan receivables from capital one we expect to recognize approximately million of associated provisions in the first quarter at quarterend our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at billion including billion for funded loans our allowance for funded loans was flat versus last quarter at for our billion accrual portfolio including an allowance for wholesale loans of and for consumer loans of for the full year we recognized firmwide net chargeoffs of million resulting in an annualized net chargeoff ratio of up basis points versus last year next lets turn to expenses on page our total operating expenses were billion in the fourth quarter for the full year our efficiency ratio was which includes a nearly 800basispoint impact from litigation expense on compensation our philosophy remains to pay for performance and we are committed to compensating top talent while compensation expenses were up yearoveryear relative to growth in revenue net of provisions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 for credit losses of our fullyear compensation ratio is at a record low reflecting the operating leverage in our franchise as we have said in the past we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses on noncompensation expense our cost for the fullyear rose versus last year excluding litigation our fullyear operating expenses grew by only inclusive of investment spend across the business and higher variable expenses associated with transaction volumes growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and lower travel and entertainment costs due to the circumstances of covid19 finally on taxes our reported tax rate was for the fourth quarter and for the year reflecting the impact of nondeductible expenses we continue to expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately under the current tax regime turning to our capital levels on slide as previously discussed our common equity tier ratio increased to at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach up basis points sequentially earnings were largely offset by higher rwas as we stepped in to serve our clients our ratio under the advanced approach increased basis points to turning to the balance sheet total assets ended the quarter at trillion rising versus last quarter as we deployed resources to facilitate client activity particularly within our prime brokerage business we maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging billion reflecting the current backdrop on the liability side our total deposits were roughly flat at billion as planned rolloff of higher cost broker deposits was partially offset by modest growth in consumer private bank and transaction banking deposits in conclusion our strong fourth quarter and results reflect the diversification of our client franchise resilience of our business model strong risk discipline and flexibility in our balance sheet deployment david john and i are proud of our people for their efforts this year in serving our clients and delivering on our strategic goals especially given the challenges of covid19 we look forward to furthering our progress on our medium and longterm targets and we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience more durable revenues and higher returns for our shareholders over time with that thank you again for dialing in and well now open the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much im curious on slide on the strategic update you went back and reminded us of the mediumterm target of for global markets and indiscernible in obviously was just a ton of repositioning and need for your assistance but is that just you being conservative on your best guess of normalized trading like nothing changed there and im just curious in the way capital is being reshifted towards asset management for private equity i just didnt know if we should be reading anything more than the obvious into the mediumterm trading targets stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey glenn its stephen no theres nothing more to read we were just on this slide reiterating the mediumterm target that we had set at i would point out that while reported roe in for global markets was the performance exlitigation thats otherwise allocated to the segment was i think the other point i would make here is that as we look forward and as weve commented several times impossible to know what and beyond hold in terms of what the industry is presented but i think there have been some fairly profound structural shift in that business one of course is the expense base is being reduced the second is were much more attuned to the sort of agile deployment of capital across but i think perhaps most important is the improvement of wallet share and the focus on clients and david commented a couple of times on the improvement in overall wallet share growing by basis points through three quarters and well see what played out for the full year but id also say that a stepup in where we stand with the objective of being top three across the top institutional clients in global markets i think also reflects that well capture at or better than our share on a going forward basis again acknowledging that the market may not look as robust on the forward as it did in for this business but the structural changes are important glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that maybe the same kind of concept for the followup related to investment management so i get the allocation of more capital i get the capital that you freed up on the announced sales i know that when you were initially going down this path i felt optimistic of your ability to raise lots of thirdparty money and you have i wonder if you have a thought process on or its just continued marching towards the ph and then the same i was concerned about selling down private equity would leave an earnings hiccup at some point but being that you have almost billion in unrecognized incentive fees do you feel like you can continue down this free up capital sell down private equity raise thirdparty cap without a big earnings hiccup thanks indiscernible the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so let me take both of those first on fundraising i think whats gratifying about the progress made in was a comment david made about an increasing number of clients new to the firm that are investing with goldman sachs and so that leaves us optimistic about the prospect of the fundraising pipeline in which will be across a range of different investing sleeves and well start to see that growing number of investing clients look across a range of different product offerings that we have on the selldown were very attentive and have always been to the prospect of creating kind of a canyon and we dont anticipate that to happen and well continue to manage with that in mind now you draw the right observation which is theres billion of embedded fees to take which we will take when gains become irrevocable or irreversible and so that will buffer but the point here is that our objective is to reduce the stress loss intensity of that segment and so weve spoken about billion in balance sheet sales to yield billion of capital relief we equally have line of sight into another billion of sales which could generate another billion of capital relief and id also point out though its not obvious in the way in which the results play but over the course of the year we sold billion of public equities to offset about a billion of appreciation in market value and so that equally has capital consequence for us and so youll continue to see us move along along that road finally on the question or the observation you made about what i was speaking to about what we will do in terms of attributed equity to that segment that has no bearing on what our objective is which is to bring capital down but as ccar was higher more capital came to the firm we dont keep a corporate segment so we allocate or attribute that equity out to the segments by definition because of its intensity asset management will pick up more capital obviously on a unit of balance sheet reduction more capital will come out as we reduce positions which is why were confident that well maintain at or better than what were indicating in terms of capital reduction in the segment overall operator your next question is from the line of christian bolu with autonomous please go ahead christian bolu q analyst autonomous good morning david and stephen maybe ill start on marcus and the digital bank thanks for the strategic update there but stepping back a bit how do you think your digital banks current and future offerings stack up against the very successful fintechs like sofi or chime and then just given the very big valuations those companies have gotten is there a way for you as a management team to better unlock maybe the value of this digital bank for shareholders david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so christian ill start with that good morning and thank you for the question and we tried to highlight this in the update that were working to go from a product structure with a handful of products to a much more integrated offering for our customers and so when you ask about comparison to some of the fintechs id just say the fintechs are much more narrow in scope in terms of what they offer and dont have the broad capabilities that we have and were embedding and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 were expanding on for our clients so just in the context of the two examples that you gave in highlighting sofi or chime when you think about spending across both checking and credit cards when you think about borrowing across credit cards and loans and you think about savings and also investing and the investment capabilities that we have as a wealth manager we have a much broader integrated offering and we continue to get feedbacks that the stateoftheart product platform and the digital applications that we have are really excellent by any standards so were going to continue to move forward with that longterm strategy i dont really have a comment on the valuation of these businesses although im watching with everyone else and im looking at what we have the number of clients we have the number of customers the size of our business the scale that we have as we continue to move forward and im looking at that opportunity the growth that we have and if people like those businesses i think at some point in time they should like and value our business more fulsomely but well continue to execute and wait on that we really like our model of having a proprietary platform for marcus but then also given our corporate relationships the potential for partnerships is very very strong for us and i think you saw that in our execution this year by adding four more partnerships by capturing the gm card and i think youll continue to see us do more on this front and so we feel good about it but as i said in my comments were taking a longterm view in what were doing and none of this will affect our mediumterm target that were working toward at the end of gets a lot of attention but it wont affect our targets christian bolu q analyst autonomous okay thank you maybe the question i was asking really around the valuation was is there something you can do ph i dont know spin off the division or something to get better valuation better currency to build the business but i hear your points maybe my second question apologies this is sort of a bit of a knitty question but im trying to understand the impact of interest rates on the markets business i guess in the earnings release you called out higher funding cost and lower yields on the liquidity reserve as a headwind to the markets business but also in the actual deck we saw a really big stepup in global markets nii quarteroverquarter so maybe just step back here remind us how interest rates impact the business whether its the current level of interest rates the strip of the yield curve and then some of the liability management actions youve taken how does that impact the markets business i guess over the coming year stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so nii christian as you noted grew it was at billion for the firm in the quarter that was driven largely by balance sheet growth notably in growth markets and most especially in prime so our prime balances were up the challenging aspect for us and the reference made in the context of funding is that our liquidity grew over the quarter we were slower to adjust particularly on the retail deposit side pricing of our liabilities and so we didnt capture quite what we wanted obviously weve now brought rates down and so were able to sort of allocate that cost out to the business so liabilities are important nii expanded because of balance sheet and impacted overall net funding costs and so thats the reference if you will to the headwinds notwithstanding prime balances growing funding costs were higher than we wanted that notwithstanding nii grew because of overall balance sheet growth over the course of the quarter in prime and by virtue overall of moving to a higher gsib in the context of meeting client demands the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 operator your next question is from the line of michael carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thanks for the update and taking the questions first as we get the moderation in global markets can you provide some color on what areas of the business and strategic initiatives are best positioned to potentially create some offset over say like the next one to two years i think it seems like asset management could be one of those or some of the initiatives maybe further out but any color on timing of growth away from some expected moderation in global markets stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i mean i think that first obviously what weve been speaking about within the asset management business and the growth of thirdparty alternatives and the forward durability of those revenues is one area theres obviously growth in some of the growth initiatives including transaction banking as well as what were doing on the consumer side and so youll continue to see pickup and share pickup none of those are necessarily meant to be compensating factors for what could be a shortfall in global markets i think within global markets we will buffer structurally speaking what might be a less impressive opportunity set on the forward relative to by virtue of what weve done around market share gains and equally what were doing around the cost base and id say also if you look within the global markets business what were seeing in terms of the growth in lowtouch highvolume activity around marquee and the digital platforms particularly growth in portfolio trading across i think all of those will spell sort of improved performance as a general matter notwithstanding the market finally id point out that the investment banking footprint continues to expand and that too will provide an offset to the extent that again the assumption to your question that we see lower opportunity as an industry matter within the trading or global markets business michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay great and then just on the capital side given your cet1 ratio premium above your expected buffer how are you thinking about either need for the business either organic or ma versus capital return and just your commentary on the asset management business and understanding maybe the models a tad a bit more like how significant could that be longer term as you kind of reposition that stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so on capital look our capital philosophy really remains unchanged which is we look for opportunities for accretive return on investment in capital in the business and equally meeting client demands that are there separate from that its my expectation that we will hit our first quarter repurchase expectations which based on the calculation of the fed will be about billion in the quarter plus neutralizing equitybased compensation expense and so we will fulfill that in the first quarter id also repeat a comment i made in the prepared remarks is that well continue to reevaluate our dividend in the context of the shape and form of the business being more durable going forward obviously thats not a first the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 quarter proposition given the fed rules but you can certainly rely on the repurchase expectations and our fulfillment of them in terms of asset management this is all about an overall reduction in the balance sheet intensity of that business it is being mindful of revenue in the near term its driving down on balance sheet investing and moving that into thirdparty activity doing that across more sleeves with more clients of the firm and i think that will continue to take down our capital and i suspect based on the progress we made in of taking billion on billion of sales and as i mentioned our forward view on whats within line of sight incremental capital will come out at or better than the expectations we carried at the investor day itself operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning everyone so wanted to start off with a question on the trading business your share gains in trading for were quite impressive likely represent the strongest gains across the entire globalized ecohort and historically youve been the dealer of choice for clients during periods of macro stress given your risk remediation expertise and those client needs were really magnified this year due to covid raising questions as to whether the share gains will be sustainable as those client need to moderate i was hoping you can give some perspective on what gives you confidence that you can sustain the recent share gains in global markets as activity normalizes and any differences youre seeing across high versus low touch might be very helpful david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc okay thanks steve ill start and i appreciate the question and ill just to take your framing you said historically at times of severe stress youve been a dealer of choice and you really you make that statement by going back and looking at one window which was the financial crisis and theres no question in the financial crisis we had very very significant share gains but i would highlight that one of the reasons that we had very significant share gains during the financial crisis is that a lot of the people that would be in our core competitive set were in a position of very very weak structural financial performance at the time and it definitely inhibited their ability to intermediate with clients so one of the things i recall hearing at that time is a lot of firms did not show up during the financial crisis and we benefited from that i think hopefully we benefited for other reasons but there was a different component we have a very very different situation right now banks have been a source of strength during the pandemic all of our competitors have showed up in spades and yet we had very very significant share gains now maybe some of that is a branded reputation that were a dealer of choice during a pandemic but i would argue a bigger impact in really affecting how we performed and ive heard this consistently from our global markets clients is a change strategically in our approach over the last few years in terms of how were facing clients our one gs approach in what were trying to do we talked a little bit in the strategic update in talking about how for the first time over the last couple of years we have a targeted approach in evaluating our wallet share with the top clients it seems relatively straightforward but this is not something we had ever done historically and then we advanced that considerably over the course of by going from top with of the clients to top of of the clients we have a much more clientcentric approach ive got a lot of feedback call this year from our clients noticing what they said was a the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 very different approach in the way goldman sachs interacted with them now and versus years ago and so i would argue across the platform that orientation is helping our wallet share gains now im not going to sit here and say that in a different environment when the world is more even and were not in a crisis that theres not going to be a flattening in fact id say that across all our businesses we tend to outperform in investment banking during times of stress and the market share gains collapsed a little bit in times when everything is very very easy and so im sure there will be some of that but we have a very very clear strategy very very clear clientcentric strategy that is different and i think its led to enhanced wallet share gains id also say we highlighted this in the context of looking at that business this goes back to one of the earlier questions we made structural improvements not just in the client approach but also in the cost base of that business and in our capital allocation in that business and the results are even if we have a different available client wallet we have a structurally more profitable business on a goforward basis and so thats the way were thinking about that i hope thats helpful stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the one other thing i would add to the part of your question you asked about kind of high touch and low touch which is if you look at our credit business in ficc over q2 q3 and q4 whats interesting is in q2 and q3 you saw amidst very high volatility a lot of the sort of bespoke idiosyncratic blocklike activity that weve long been known for whats interesting is if you look at q4 we started to see very high portfolio trading going on rebalancing among asset managers pension funds a lot of that going on across our digital platforms ill just offer you that q2 q3 and then through q4 as a reflection of kind of a more a broader more robust business thats better equipped better capable better positioned to capture what weve long been known to do as we did in the second and third quarter and some of the more technologydriven platformdriven trading that is newer and quite sticky in the context of what we can keep david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats really interesting color i appreciate the perspective from both of you and just for my followup on efficiency you spoke of your continued efforts to evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings i was hoping if you can just give some perspective on what some of those opportunities might be especially as we think about the need to potentially flex in a tougher macro backdrop and just one clarifying point is the million of savings should we be thinking about the savings already captured versus the baseline or is that versus the fullyear expense base david michael a solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well ill start on that ill let stephen answer the second point with respect to the million but i just steven i think the way you should understand that were thinking about this is weve been reunderwriting the firm and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 trying to do what we can across the platform to operate more efficiently we set out a target in our investor day and we had a very clear view on the path to that target when we said that a year ago at our investor day and were marching through and were executing on that with respect to other opportunities we continue to evaluate other opportunities and would be hardpressed to say that we didnt learn a lot this year in the context of the operating environment that weve been operating this year and so thats giving us new insights into other places across the platform where things can be more efficient in addition our business like lots of businesses is digitizing and in the context of that its allowing us to digitize processes that historically weve used weve executed with more manual personnel so to speak so were going to continue to focus on that we do think there are other opportunities when we have more to say to be more specific with our continued focus on transparency well give you more specifics stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah to the first part of your question achieving billion was annualized savings so we would realize these savings each and every year and this was as against kind of entrylevel expenses meaning entering into when we announced them at investor day but this is achieving a billion annual runrate savings of which about half has been achieved the only other thing i would add on the forward is obviously covid has accelerated our own thinking about moving populations and taking aggregations of people into different areas and so i think we feel more assured and confident at our ability to do that the pace of it and youll continue to see that play forward in the achievement of the billion or beyond operator your next question is from the line of jeff harte with piper sandler please go ahead jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co good morning sorry about that stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey jeff david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co am i coming through now david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah indiscernible the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co hey how are you thinking about the cyclical outlook for capital markets activity levels broadly and i guess i come from theres a belief out there that the strength in was really just a stimulusdriven anomaly and that maybe were headed back to levels but when i look at historical cyclicality and activity level indicators it suggests potential sustainability if not continued growth how are you thinking about that as we move into and david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well its ill take this at a high level jeff obviously its hard to and i wouldnt speculate going out for multiple years but what i would say is were still in the middle of a pandemic theres still an enormous amount of stimulus and there is also because of the acceleration of digital trends there are lots of businesses and lots of ceos that are rethinking or reunderwriting strategically how theyre positioned so corporate activity and therefore capital markets activity in that context is high certainly as we head into there are a lot of indicators that thats going to continue in certainly in the nearterm and so our expectation is certainly in the nearterm that activity will continue to the degree that we get to a more normalized environment to the degree that there is a backing off of fiscal activity to the degree over time theres a more normalization of monetary policy that obviously can affect this activity level but thats not something wed expect in the nearterm in so at the moment pipeline backlogs things that we can see continue to look robust that doesnt mean that were saying that we expect a repeat of everything we saw in and there certainly are different parts of both the banking and the markets business that i think were elevated in and our expectations for are not as robust as they were in but certainly more robust than they were in jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay and thank you secondly as you continue to grow deposits are you facing limits on your ability to deploy the incremental deposit growth i guess when i look at your balance sheet i see deposit ph investable earning asset growth is more of a pressing need than additional deposit growth stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think that on the forward you should expect a more moderated level of growth in deposits as we pull more and more assets into the bank i think as i noted in the remarks weve moved from of assets in the banks to but importantly on incremental asset movement of the lending thats going on in and around the firm is being booked in bank entities that will consume deposit funding that goes on in the bank entities themselves id also point out that when we speak about bank entities were not only speaking about our us bank but equally the uk and our bank in continental europe in germany all of which have slightly different requirements in terms of the deployment of that funding but the incremental asset flow is going into the bank and youre going to start to see continued growth from of the overall firm operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey betsy david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc question on the expense side just a twopart one on the comp and the comp ratio we did see the comp ratio come down on a fullyear basis roughly basis points yearonyear and im just wondering is that really a function of noncompensatable revenues that shot up significantly yearonyear or this reflects the comments you were making earlier about moving people to the strategic locations it feels like a lot in one year so just trying to unpack the major drivers and how we should expect ph that flexes going forward stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think the abiding observation here is that there is considerable leverage in the business that is when we grow revenue top line by or grow it net of provision for credit loss you see our comp and benefit line rise by so theres embedded leverage in this business i think as weve also said in the past and this is reflected a little bit in your question the comp ratio is going to become much less of a relevant metric in this in part because the profile of the business will change that is as we grow up businesses like transaction banking or the consumer business they will be less compheavy in terms of overall expense and that ratio will be ultimately less relevant but i think for where we are right now theres considerable leverage in this where were capable of rewarding our talent for performance overall but equally doing that on a levered basis so that our shareholders and shareholders benefit more broadly from the overall performance betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and could we just get a sense on the tech budget that youve got right now and how youre thinking about that size and growth over the next year or so stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think the tech budget is going to continue to grow itll grow by several hundred million dollars yearover year it will do that really for two reasons one continued improvement at the core that is the way in which the firm operates more broadly it is achievement of some of what david was talking about around automation and the like and then separately it will be focused on particular initiatives like transaction banking like the consumer business and so forth the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 and i think part of our focus on the efficiencies that were capable and the cost savings were capable of getting is such that those savings can subsidize the investment being made in places like technology around the firm and so youll continue to see that investment play out we have less remedial activity than perhaps some of the other bigger commercial banks have inasmuch as we have a lot of new tech build and new activity going on but were going to continue to look to harvest cost savings to substantially offset the impact of that increased investment operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi could you give more color on your backlog you said its nearrecord its up big quarteroverquarter and specifically as it relates to spacs how much have spacs contributed to our revenues in and whats the multiplier effect i understand its linked with mergers and leveraged finance where youre top three or number one just more color on spacs and how it relates to backlog and what thats been contributing and how sustainable that is david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so a couple of comments backlog levels as we stated are up quarteroverquarter and id say that activity levels broadly across the banking platform are up certainly spac activity is contributing to it but strategic corporate ma is up meaningfully and what id say is there was a real kind of doldrum as the pandemic hit and people were reorganizing but as we came out in the summer and people started to kind of look through the tunnel and get a sense of where things were going strategic activity with corporates really picked up and thats contributed meaningfully also and that has nothing really to do with the spac ecosystem on spacs mike ill say a couple of things and theres no question that the growth of spacs as a product definitely affected activity levels but there are a few things that id say just to try to frame it spacs were a little bit more than of ipo activity this year but when you look at ipo activity ipo activity for us for example was on a volume basis about of our equity volume so we did about billion of ipo league table against billion of equity league table if you look at our ipo fees all ipos spac and nonspac and again spacs lets just say around but if you look at our ipo fees our ipo fees were less than of all our equity underwriting fees and then spacs would be a subset of that now to your point it also creates an ecosystem around capital raising around advisory services et cetera and so theres no question that that ecosystem at the moment is creating a tailwind for some of these capital market activities there are a couple other things id say first we generally strive to be number one in the league tables we do not strive to be number one in the spac league tables we are very while were very active were very thoughtful about our sponsors and the business that we take on and just looking at last year if you look at the number of spacs that were done and the league table leaders the number one and number two firms did about more deals than we did representative i think of some of the things that came to us that we turned away so were participating but were trying to participate by picking what we think are the best situations i do think spacs is a good use case versus a traditional ipo and advantages for sellers and for investors in looking at this ecosystem but the ecosystem is not without flaws i think its still evolving i think the incentive system is still evolving one of the things were watching very very closely is the incentives of the sponsors and also the incentives of somebody thats selling and while i think these activity levels continue to be very robust and if they do continue as we head into to continue to be very very robust i do not think this is sustainable the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 in the mediumterm and therell be something that will in some way shape or form bring the activity levels down over a period of time but were watching it closely and its something that our clients continue to be very very interested in there are lots of companies that go public via spac that could also go public in a traditional ipo and there are some companies that go public in a spac that probably couldnt go public through the standardized process of a traditional ipo and all of those are things that the market will have to wrestle with and one of the things i certainly think is the case is you have something here thats a good capital markets innovation but like many innovations theres a point in time as they start where they have a tendency maybe to go a little bit too far and then need to be pulled back or rebalanced in some way and thats something my guess is well see over the course of or with spacs mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one more general question david so i think what i hear you say on this call is that its not a forecast but kind of your expectation for capital markets for this year it might be a little bit less than last year but it should still be better than or something like that we had a decadelong reduction in wallet share in the markets business do you think that decadelong reduction considering it normalized last year do you think thats reversing some people say it is some people say it wont david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so two points i think mike to the question if i got it right with im not going to speculate on a forecast on a specific forecast around capital markets activity but i do think your statement is fair in terms of the way i framed it which is capital markets activity is starting very robust based on the data we have it seems like it will continue to be relatively robust in but we dont expect it to be at the same level that it was in with respect to your second question i assume youre asking about global markets wallet share or were you asking about banking and markets wallet share mike operator one moment let me open mikes line david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc decade yeah can you hear me yeah trading share over a decade yeah david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc of global markets youre talking about mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc correct the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc okay so i talked earlier on the call about the way over the last years weve evolved our strategy and i think the strategy we have for our global markets business is a good strategy for goldman sachs i like our position and weve consolidated share why have we done that weve done that because we have a very clientcentric approach a very holistic one goldman sachs approach we have a much more targeted wallet share approach to the largest institutional clients that we interact with in that business and that has allowed us to strengthen our position and so i cant go back and make all the direct comparisons that everybody wants but i think there are a lot of things and i stated some of this earlier that are very different about what we saw coming out of the financial crisis and what evolved versus where were operating today so the wallet may change but i think weve made material strides in strengthening our position in global markets and i expect us to hold a number of those wallet share gains and were very very focused on making sure we do operator your next question is from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking the questions so first is on the investments that youre making on the consumer side we theres regular speculation in the press around maybe what you might be considering on the ma front and actually the speculation is centered on consumer banking and so could you help is the indication and the idea that you guys are interested in investing in that business and pushing that impacting some of the targets a sort of a clear indication that youre really interested in building rather than buying and as i sit here i just kind of wonder okay why would these guys want to invest so much if they had if there was something large that they were looking to do in anything remotely close to the nearterm just curious your thoughts on that whether thats too big a leap david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well theres a lot there in what you said brennan but im going to repeat something that ive said over and over again were focused on building an integrated digital platform in the consumer space i think over the last four plus years were off to a very good start weve given you lots of metrics so we can track that progress and we continue to roll out on the investments that were making including as we said youll see invest this quarter markets invest this quarter and youll see checking during the course of the year with respect to ma opportunities broadly whether its to expand our consumer offering whether its to grow our asset management business whether its to expand our wealth management capability were always looking for ways to accelerate our strategic growth plans if something came along that helped us accelerate or advance our strategic growth plan and we thought that it was a good fit strategically and we thought we could acquire it and integrate it attractively then we would do it just as we did with united capital but the bar to do something significant is extremely high and its not an easy thing to do so well continue to look for things that can accelerate our growth plan but were going to continue to invest in these businesses and i think the important thing for you to note is that we have a lot of confidence that these can be sizable businesses at scale that are accretive to goldman sachs returns even if we do not do something significant inorganically the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then my second one is on the efficiencies and i know there have been a few questions there but from my perspective i guess its just a little bit hard to unpack and see some of the million that you referenced earlier stephen you guys have a lot of revenue and volume sensitivity on your expense side and thats usually particularly true on the comp front so maybe how much of the million was in noncomp versus comp and what is your expectation for the timing on the remaining million any color you can give would be helpful stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah yeah yeah so let me answer the question a couple of ways first of all a spot observation on noncomp expense in the year so our noncomp was up ex litigation of about million of noncomp expense increase yearoveryear about twothirds in excess of million was variable expense bce all of which is related to the volume of activity thats coming through and so i just frame that just so you have a sense of how noncomp framed out over the course of the year now if you look at our achievement of about half of the billion of runrate efficiencies that weve set as a target for ourselves i would say up through the end of a good proportion of that came out of the compensation side okay relative to noncomp so by that i mean weve undertaken a very significant exercise over the course of at spans and layers meaning weve looked at the sheer number of people we have in a variety of parts of the organization weve looked at scope of management and weve been able to sort of achieve efficiencies in that regard we engaged in a fronttoback exercise that put more people from an ops and technology point of view in line of sight of the people in the business who know and understand what their objectives are and where theyre going third is weve looked at location of where many of these people are and have accelerated that and so thats on the sort of compensation side on the noncompensation side i would say that weve done a complete rationalization of campuses in places like london and in bangalore harvesting significant savings there weve moved to a more disciplined and centralized planning tool weve looked to centralize our expense management through sap taking multiple platforms and pulling them into one all of these have sort of put us in a position to realize about of the billion and frankly speaking give us a bit more confidence about what we can achieve on the forward perhaps in excess of it and so that may be a bit more granular than you want but just to lay out sort of the elements right of where these expenses are being harvested operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david youve been very clear about the difference in your success in this stress period versus and and we all know the consolidation of the brokerdealer community over the last years has been dramatic can you address your success based on economies of scale and how i know youve done a very good job on the customercentric focus that you talked about already but how important is economies of scale today versus maybe or years ago and is that an advantage that you and some of your peers have over the smaller brokerdealers the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so gerard i think its a good question i appreciate it and i think theres a huge advantage and so putting aside some of the things im talking about that are strategically based on our conscious decisions we happen to be one of a handful of firms that is global at scale and a market leader in these global markets and investment banking businesses and i think it is increasingly difficult to compete in these businesses unless youre global and at scale unless you have the capacity to make very very significant technology investments into platforms to better connect with your clients and so there has been a consolidation of wallet share into the leading players across these platforms and we continue to be one of those players and i think that position has only grown and been strengthened i also would point out that we dont just have scale broadly weve stayed committed as i highlighted earlier in my remarks to all the different silos and asset classes across our markets business so you think about the many asset classes across markets we benefited because we stayed committed to commodities and we have a more fulsome offering for our clients and there was a real benefit to that this year so i think theres no question the leading firms have a strong competitive advantage i think to maintain that competitive advantage and have reasonable margins given the capital requirements the technology requirements the regulatory requirements being in a leadership position is much more important today than it was years ago gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just quickly stephen on the capital position and when the federal reserve releases all the banks from the limitations on share repurchases based on the income equation they have given you guys would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program once everybody is released from that limitation stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think the manner and form of our execution sort of well decide and proceed forward what i would reiterate is that right now the fed is not quite at the scb regime that had been laid out initially remember scb was meant to put banks in a position all banks that if youre above your minimum you can go about share repurchase dividend et cetera were not there yet the fed has limited what we can do on repurchase as i spoke about earlier we will execute to the capacity that we have to repurchase in the first quarter i dont think its appropriate for me to comment on the mechanism by which we will do it but certainly safe to rely on the fact that well look to use our capacity and proceed from there operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks just two questions here first maybe just a clarification on the provision that you mentioned from the credit card relationship i think there was million attributed to that i just want to make sure is that a gross number or are you saying that the provision expense in the first quarter the million on a net basis stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 sure so just to be clear in connection with the backbook that were requiring relative to the gm partnership we anticipate taking approximately million of provisions in the first quarter so to be clear its not reflected in im just giving you and the market sort of an indication of what that will be occasioned by the acquisition of that backbook and thats an accounting rule and requirement that were adhering to brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then also as it relates to reserve given what your expectation is for economic conditions from here when can you expect to kind of see more reverse releases or larger i guess reserve releases on a goforward basis stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so again in the fourth quarter were taking provision for credit loss of million i would tell you that embedded in that is a release of about million occasioned by better macroeconomic observations and adjusting the model and reserve release that release though was offset in the context of incremental provisions either occasioned by impairments or growth in the overall portfolio so its not to reflect anything negative or a negative comment on the state of our performance of the portfolio but rather growth in it across the whole of the firm i would say as an aside we continue to see our consumer portfolio perform better from a credit perspective than even what we had anticipated coming into the crisis but embedded in the provision is release that release offset by growth and by impairments operator your next question is from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning you seem to be progressing pretty well towards your targets but i think whether you look at consensus expectations or talk to investors there seems to be some skepticism around you hitting the rote the efficiency ratio in i think that reflects some uncertainty around the trajectory of trading and ib but maybe we can take a step back and just ask it this way i guess what kind of growth were you assuming in those kind of more volatile revenue streams it doesnt seem like initially it was a lot of growth expected from levels but i guess maybe asking the question this way do you still feel comfortable hitting those targets in with revenues in sort of trading and investment banking similar to or does it have to be materially higher stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so remember on the efficiency ratio and obviously its implied by your question theres a revenue and theres an expense component to it on the revenue side we saw more growth in than had been anticipated but we nonetheless expect levels of growth consistent with what we anticipated at our investor day and id also point out that we continue to work on the expense side as weve spoken about in relation to a number of questions on this call and there continues to be leverage in the business to the extent that revenue growth doesnt materialize as we expected weve got levers to pull on expense which is why we are comfortable with a view that well achieve an efficiency ratio at or around by obviously we were better than that ex litigation in the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities sure stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc there will be variability to it but there are levers to pull as to the extent that the growth doesnt play but were assuming that it will and its not entirely reliant on global markets james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right i think the assumption was very minimal growth in sort of those core businesses excluding some of the investments is that fair stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think thats fair david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think thats fair james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities all right great thanks operator your next question is from the line of jeremy sigee with exane bnp paribas please go ahead jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thank you and thanks for the strategy update youve talked a bit about growth in the previous question and some of the earlier ones but growth im thinking of the organic build in some of your new businesses the transaction bank and the consumer businesses i wondered if you could put those in the context of the evolving environment that faces us in with still some areas of stress continuing but some areas of recovery which of those new businesses do you see accelerating the growth or slowing or changing the game plan of how you proceed stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well its interesting i think that we should take them each on their own in transaction banking i think what we have hit is a resonating chord with our clients about the nature of what we built meaning weve built a new and improved digital interface by which corporations can manage their operational flows and that has been a refreshing change to kind of legacy platforms that have been there i say that not as just simply an observer but also a consumer of that service where goldman sachs is using its own platform and i think that will continue in part because operational flows across corporates will continue almost notwithstanding what plays out in the context of the market movement overall the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 the consumer side may be a different proposition now it depends on the perspective you take with respect to gdp growth and what happens with rates and the like but i think as david has said on the consumer side we are playing for the longterm that is building a relationship with tens of millions of consumers and pivoting in to a broader more comprehensive platform that i think will attract more consumers to the platform not simply because theres an attractiveness to the deposit rate or to rate on lending but because well offer a more comprehensive package of investing and checking and well become a more reliable primary bank to more consumers and i think that will play out again kind of notwithstanding where the markets otherwise take us on some of the more capital marketsintensive activity jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas and just a followup on a different area in the global markets business weve talked a lot on the call about the outlook for volumes and for volatility but it feels like one of the elements of strength this past year has been wider bidoffer spreads i wondered if you could sort of comment do you agree with that observation that thats been a contributing factor to the strength and how you see that evolving do you think we see a return of pressure on trading profitability as we go forward stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so im going to go back to a response i made to one of the questions earlier which is q2 and q3 look different than q4 we experienced and benefited from wider bidoffer during the intensity of what played out in q2 and q3 and the fact as david has mentioned now several times that we stayed the game and showed up across a range of asset classes helped us and we benefited from that theres no question that as you moved to the back of the year in q4 you saw compression from what was wide in q2 and q3 but there again wallet share gains benefited us and equally playing to both high touch and low touch and so the advent of what we were doing through marquee and equally through portfolio trading on these electronic platforms was of equal benefit so tighter bid offer there as opposed to wider bidoffer in q2 but i think youre seeing a business that is more diverse broader and in a position to continue to intermediate flows and do so with very high balance sheet velocity operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so since there are no more questions wed like to take a moment to thank everybody for joining the call on behalf of the senior management team we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months and if there are any additional questions that arise in the meantime please dont hesitate to reach out to heather and her team otherwise please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our first
