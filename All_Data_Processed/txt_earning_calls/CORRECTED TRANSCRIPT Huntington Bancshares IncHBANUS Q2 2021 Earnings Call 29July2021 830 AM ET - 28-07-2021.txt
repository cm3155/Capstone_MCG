considerable investments weve made in our culture and digital technology slide provides an overview of huntingtons strategy to build the leading peoplefirst digitally powered bank in the nation huntington is a purposedriven company and organic growth and sustainable topquartile financial performance remain core tenets of our strategic vision the acquisition of tcf is additive on both fronts as it supports continued organic growth opportunities and allows us to leverage the incremental scale to drive efficiencies and deliver topquartile financial returns were very wellpositioned to benefit from the strength of the economic recovery our accelerated investments during the past year are driving new customer acquisition and retention and we expect to continue to capture market share gains and increase share of wallet in the second half of and beyond on a macro basis labor constraints and wage inflation remain a concern for many of our business customers however confidence levels are very high and leading economic indicators are positive many of our customers continue to see record cash flows and profitability driving unprecedented levels of liquidity which continue to weigh on our growth and line utilization rates we expect borrowers may opt to carry more liquidity than they had previously given what we all experienced with the pandemic the supply chain issues and ongoing labor constraints but nonetheless our loan pipelines are strong and continue to build and we remain optimistic that conditions favorable for improved loan growth will strengthen during the second half of as we move into turning to slide id like to give an update on the tcf integration we continue to be on track for all key integration activities we closed the acquisition in early june and completed phase one of branch consolidations closing meijer instore branches we expect to close the required branch divestiture in the third quarter and to complete the majority of the remaining system conversions over columbus day weekend the final three phases of branch consolidations are expected to be completed by monthend october in addition to our focus on systems product and customer conversion we were also focused on fully integrating our new tcf colleagues into huntingtons culture huntingtons strategy of building the nations leading people first digitally powered bank begins with our people our colleagues both legacy and new tcf colleagues acting together are the key to our success and i see and appreciate our colleagues and the differences they make in customers lives and our communities every day were very fortunate weve a tremendous team with commercial banking the businesses weve added from tcf such as inventory finance and vendor finance to name a few continue to be complementary and additive to our overall strategy in consumer banking tcf had progressed on customer experience but now the opportunity to introduce our digital capabilities our products our services combined with our fair play philosophy will significantly bolster the customer experience as they convert to huntington as we introduce the huntington brand our products and services and the commitment of our colleagues to our new markets and expanded customer base we clearly see opportunity to gain additional market share to deepen relationships and to drive organic revenue growth turning to slide while the tcf acquisition is an important part of our growth plan we remain focused on the larger organic growth strategies we have been executing our investments in digital and technology continue to drive strong returns for our business nearly half of new consumer deposit accounts are now open digitally while huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings

standby cash and early pay which are part of our road map to continue to innovate and advance our customercentric fair play banking philosophy we are continuing to innovate with additional new products and features to be launched later this year and next and were seeing traction in customer acquisition and weve restored marketing investments to prepandemic levels so as we continue to build our specialty banking efforts within commercial were seeing strong sales activities growing pipelines and momentum in originations before i turn it over to zach i want to take a moment to say thank you to mark for his hard work and dedication to huntington as hes led our investor relationship team for the last eight years seven years mark will be taking on a finance leadership role as cfo of our important vehicle finance division were pleased to welcome tim sedabres as our new director of ir congratulations to mark on your new role and welcome to tim zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides the highlights for the second quarter which included closing the tcf transaction delivering a strong new loan production and maintaining solid credit quality as well as robust liquidity and capital positions on a fully reported basis including all impacts of the acquisition we reported a net loss per common share of per share for the second quarter earnings were impacted by acquisition expenses of million and the socalled seasonal doublecount provision expense of million earnings per common share adjusted for these notable items were positive per share as steve mentioned we closed the tcf acquisition in june and we remain on track for the realization of the deal economics even as we brought on tcf our teams did not lose focus on driving organic growth across the bank we saw underlying loan growth extcf in many of our consumer loan portfolios namely mortgage auto and rv marine we also saw encouraging new commercial loan production and building pipelines fee income was also a bright spot in the quarter as we saw increases on our underlying huntington business including treasury management card and payments capital markets and our wealth and investment businesses with respect to credit net chargeoffs were basis points the allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at and was driven by provisioning of million from the acquired tcf loan book offset against the million of reserve release from the legacy huntington book detailed loan and credit marks related to tfc are included on slide of the appendix liquidity remained elevated as we continued to see growth in deposit balances this gives us ample opportunity to deploy and do incremental lending opportunities and securities to support net interest income growth in the coming quarters additionally we fully exited the capital protection hedging position that utilized interest rate caps closing out a very useful hedge and replacing them with alternative capital protection tools which have less earnings volatility as they qualify for hedge accounting finally common equity tier ended the quarter at huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 turning to slide fte net interest income increased primarily driven by the additional tcf in the quarter on a linkedquarter basis net interest margin decreased basis points to primarily driven from the net change in the interest rate caps from the prior quarter looking for a moment at the underlying nim dynamics the impact in the second quarter from the marktomarket on the caps was negative basis points while we saw basis points benefit from purchase accounting accretion therefore the underlying nim excluding the caps in paa was approximately for the second quarter this compares to on the same basis in the prior quarter as weve noted in previous calls we had expected a reduction in nim into q2 driven in part by a 9basis point step down in the benefit of our existing interest rate hedging positions as well as forecasted ppp dynamics and yield curve impacts on spread at the morgan stanley conference in june we guided to a second quarter nim in the low2 the underlying second quarter nim of was a few basis points below expectations due to the additional impact of excess liquidity as deposits yet again increased in the quarter and elevated fed caps represented an 18basis point drag on the nim in the quarter looking ahead we continue to expect q2 to be the low point for nim for the year driving a positive trend will be the additional tcf assets that will benefit margin as we get a full quarter impact of those acquired assets in the third quarter also the continued execution of our balance sheet optimization program will provide benefits from our ongoing focus on funding cost optimization asset mix and customer level pricing and over time we expect the elevated liquidity levels that i mentioned to normalize reducing that 18basis point drag back down to zero as it does these positive factors will offset some continued spread pressure from competition for highquality assets and the absolute level of interest rates as well as impacts from the rolloff of hedges as illustrated on the next slide all told these changes are expected to bring us to a net interest margin in the next quarter our outlook continues to point to nim stability at approximately those levels for the foreseeable future going forward turning to slide in the second quarter the interest rate caps resulted in a million negative marktomarket driven by lower rates at quarterend however cumulatively over the life of these caps the strategy was highly effective and resulted in a million pretax gain million net of tax but as we intended offset approximately of the negative impact on capital from rising rates as the securities portfolio gradually grew during the last two quarters and prepayment fees on that portfolio have reduced we now have the opportunity to utilize a more traditional hedging structure to accomplish the same capital protection objective hence we fully exited the caps during the second quarter and replaced them with billion of forward starting swaps which qualify for hedge accounting and reduced earnings volatility while achieving a similar level of capital protection additionally we moved billion of securities from available for sale into held for maturity during the quarter in order to further minimize volatility in oci as a result of the changes in interest rates turning to slide average loan balances increased by yearoveryear driven by the added tcf balances and continued growth in our consumer loan portfolios periodend loan balances ended the second quarter at billion we continued to have nearrecord origination levels in our consumer portfolios in the second quarter with rv marine automobile and residential mortgage all continuing to post sequential quarter growth despite the inventory constraints in auto and rv marine consumer demand remains very high driving continued strength in originations the same can be said for home lending where origination activity is quite robust despite huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 ongoing home inventory constraints the calling activity and origination volumes in the commercial portfolios also continue to be robust however overall commercial growth is constrained by pressure on utilization rates auto dealer floor plan balances remained a headwind in the quarter driven by inventory supply constraints but were optimistic that were nearing the floor for these balances the outlook is expected to slowly recover from these levels as oems deliver increased inventory to dealers the inventory finance business from tcf has been facing a similar headwind as inventory levels have been depressed and outstandings have been near multiyear lows commercial utilization rates for our middle market and corporate portfolios remained relatively stable in the second quarter cumulatively these three areas of commercial lending combined represent billion to billion of incremental loan growth opportunity as utilization rates recover with respect to investment securities we completed a repositioning of the acquired tcf portfolio to improve both yield and to reduce duration we also deployed an incremental billion of excess liquidity into additional securities inclusive of these actions the securities portfolio ended the quarter at billion given the level of access liquidity we had at quarterend we would expect to grow the securities portfolio incrementally by approximately billion over the remainder of slide provides an update on ppp in total we originated billion of ppp loans inclusive of tcfs activity we continue to expect approximately of balances from the programs to ultimately be forgiven ppp loans totaled billion at quarterend with a significant acceleration in the pace of forgiveness during june we anticipate forgiveness of the majority of balances to be completed in the second half of the year with a portion trailing into early turning to slide average total deposits increased sequentially due to the acquisition of tcf and increased customer liquidity levels at huntington we continue to leverage excess liquidity to manage wholesale funding balances and costs lower slide illustrates strength of our capital and liquidity ratios as i mentioned common equity tier ended the quarter at and is near the top of our to operating guideline these strong capital levels coupled with the ongoing economic recovery and our merger integration proceeding as planned gave us confidence to relaunch our share buyback program earlier than previously expected the board has authorized million of common stock repurchases over the next four quarters that will likely be overweighted toward the earlier part of that time our capital plan entails managing our cet1 ratio towards the lower half of our to operating range over the medium term this plan is supported by our finalization of the marks on the acquired portfolio and our confidence in the pro forma earnings power and return on capital profile of the company slide provides a view of our allowance for credit losses the second quarter ending acl represents of total loans down from at prior quarterend the allowance includes the previously mentioned tcf credit marks which was partially offset by an reserve release on the legacy huntington portfolio slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter our overall credit performance remains strong net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases below our to 55basis point through the cycle average target range consumer chargeoffs are quite low this quarter at just huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 basis points as auto and home equity portfolios both reported net recoveries yeartodate consumer net charge offs have been basis points our criticized assets and npa ratios were both modestly higher as a result of the tcfacquired portfolios these portfolios came over as expected consistent with our detailed due diligence work and we remain comfortable with the acquired book the acl coverage on npa is strong at finally turning to our outlook on slide weve provided a set of mediumterm financial targets including a return on tangible common equity a efficiency ratio while remaining committed to investing in our people first digitally powered strategy these metrics in addition to sustainable top line revenue growth slightly above nominal gdp will drive earnings per share growth over time our efficiency ratio will benefit from expense synergies from the tcf acquisition and incorporates our commitments to continued investment in technology and digital capabilities annual positive operating leverage remains a core principle of our strategy we believe these metrics revenue growth return on capital and annual positive operating leverage are a compelling set of financial performance indicators and are closely aligned with value creation for our shareholders now let me turn it back over to mark and well get to your questions mark a muth senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thank you zach we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has any additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey so i think one of the main issues over the past few months has been the sort of the higher expense guides and there are a couple of those now that tcf is in the mix its a little tougher to tell exactly whats going on from sort of the standalone huntington basis wonder if you could just speak or provide some color on how we can feel confident that sort of that guide that you offered earlier in the year about huntingtons standalone growth indeed peaking and will normalize from here how does that play out what should we be watching for from the outside to understand the expense control et cetera zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question scott thanks and this is zach ill take that one so two big messages i would offer to you one is on an underlying huntington basis as you noted very much executing to our prior plan which has been elevated levels of expense in the first two quarters of the year driven by our investments bringing that growth rate back down into the lowsingle digits by the second half of the year everything that were were completely executing to that plan and everything id seen in terms of forecasts for standalone huntington and our track up until the close of the acquisition midjune was very much corroborating that in fact q2 was coming in a bit lower in terms of overall expense growth and the outlook continues to be as we disclosed and secondly the tcf cost energies are very much on track and were executing on that as we speak the branch rationalization as steve noted in his comments indiscernible the systems conversion is planned personnel decisions are finalized weve completed the a lot of the vendor conversion including the progress on real estate consolidations so the majority of those cost saves from the tcf acquisition will benefit with really the full run rate of being present in the backhalf of the year as we go into excluding onetime costs which clearly would be noisy on an organic basis we expect to step up into q3 as we get a full quarter of the tcf expense base and then from there beginning in q4 over the next six quarters see gradual reductions each quarter as the synergies are realized so pretty steady no major step down at this point in our outlook huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect so absolute declines in expenses sort of starting in the fourth quarter it sounds like that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc correct scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then switch gears a little i think zach you had talked about the margin going into the beginning in the third quarter can you sort of specify and i apologize if i missed this in taking my notes but what would be included in that is that does that include ppp forgiveness fees purchase accounting benefits et cetera zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc it does include the dynamics we see around ppp which move around in single digits on a quartertoquarter basis but doesnt include the benefit of paa paa will be a couple basis points of benefit so not overly significant i think paa to give you a sense its basis points in q3 and negative basis points into so relatively small in paa so really the core underlying nim that will be in the r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you guys very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks scott operator our next question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc morning ken zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc in terms of the loans obviously its kind of hard to see the sort of the core loan growth just given the merger with tcf this quarter can you just talk about i guess what was sort of the underlying growth in loans and im also kind of curious i know you guys sound pretty positive about the growth outlook in the second half of the year for loan balances but how does that play out in the near term just given supply chain constraints and sort of generally weaker overall industry growth i mean is your positive outlook more weighted towards the fourth quarter than or is it pretty split between the two zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question ken this is zach ill take it just a couple of things i would share with you one to answer your question about kind of the underlying huntington growth and i will caveat to say that were deeply integrating the businesses at this point so over time it will be more and more difficult for us to kind of segregate in this way but generally what we were seeing was consumer growth kind of close to and commercial growth just slightly less than flat so overall it was pretty flat particularly when you strip out the decline in ppp quartertoquarter going forward and more importantly i think the two dynamics that weve been seeing and we tried to kind of illustrate it in the prepared remarks continue to very much the thing to focus on firstly new production is quite strong at or better than our plan on the consumer side surprising continuing to strengthen in mortgage and auto and then on the commercial side record calling activity driving pipelines up both sequentially from q1 but id also say very very healthy growth versus and so its giving us a lot of confidence in where new production is going and its really just a question of watching therefore the second factor which is the impact from the elevated liquidity in the system and supply chain issues on existing line utilization and so i think the net outcome of this from what were seeing is probably about additional growth pressure in the backhalf of this year and whereas at the beginning of the year i guided for to loan growth and then by june at the morgan stanley conference that we talked about sort of the low end of that range my expectation now is sort of roughly flat on average in the second half of the year with growth really starting to rebound as we get out into and go forward i think theres some pretty clear signs for optimism here i think on the places where the supply chains are really pressuring inventory utilization in auto and then certainly in the new tcfacquired inventory finance book were seeing oem production increase and our clients want to use these lines so i think over the course of into well see that billion to billion come back and the new production really shows no signs of slowing down at this point so were bullish about the future and i think the throughout the course of youll see those conditions improve ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it perfect and then just as a followup question back on the nim the 10basis point increase that you expect in how much of that is driven just simply by the addition of tcf and all the purchase accounting kind of issues versus the balance sheet optimization or management initiatives that you guys talked about zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 yeah sequentially much of it is driven by the tcf acquisition but i think over time the balance sheet optimization program is providing a great floor for us and really contributing to what would have otherwise been yield curve impacts pushing it lower so thats indiscernible give you ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator our next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc morning steve zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc as a start for you zach so theres obviously a lot going on this quarter when we look at the of adjusted eps is that a run rate that you can grow from zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think the outlook weve got for earnings is good given the tcf synergies coming in clearly its going to be a noisy couple of quarters here just with closing the acquisition but our expectation is well continue to drive forward very much according to the expectations with that going all the way back to december of last year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then in terms of staying on offense right over the last few quarters you guys have discussed increasing the pace of investment write new hires and we know ma deals are quite distracting right where youre trying to put two companies together are you able to keep that momentum on offensive or do you really need to turn the focus internal to make sure this integration goes seamless as possible huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steve this is steve steinour weve been doing both all along the core has been executing really well we sold some new products just launched last month on the consumer side and i think what zach shared earlier subject to the reduction in new line utilizations and floor plan rates the pipelines have been good and were closing at or above budget so weve come into this quarter strong and in comparison to where we had a more normalized comparison so we like what we see in the core and were at the same time really doing a great teams are doing a great job on the integration so were either on schedule or ahead of schedule and weve been able to make some really good decisions around the talent within tcf combining to make huntington a stronger company so very very pleased with what we see lot of work yet to do but were moving rapidly and by the end of october the branch consolidations are done the major systems conversions are done and were going to enter substantially set which is probably close to a record time with a june closing for the tcf transaction really like what we see and were confident about both being able to deliver the core were very focused on that as well as to get the economics of integration steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve operator thank you our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning just a question couple of questions one talk to us a little bit on the consumer side like youve done a lot steve since taking over in terms of making it a very consumerfriendly bank address to me two things one the competitive pressure that youre seeing from either the fintechs or the neobanks around consumer fees and how youre thinking about it where do you see the most risk and do you see a particular risk to tcfs deposit customer base which seems to be the target for some of these banks that are coming up either fintechs or neobanks thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim weve been focused on the consumer side since we launched fair play in weve had a series of feature function benefits starting with the 24hour grace of the asteriskfree checking product thats been a core product and we build out the product lines weve continued to innovate over the last decade allday deposit and more recently safety zone a year ago this time and different things so were disrupting ourselves against the game plan of trying to be the premier consumer bank in our footprint and i think were achieving that i think in the last nine years weve had six jd power number ones in consumer banking in our footprint we got the three mobile apps in a row like what were seeing were not done we had some really interesting ideas that well be working on through this year and well into next to further distinguish and provide growth opportunities for us now in the context of tcf i see a fair banking philosophy just as a huge advantage for that customer base and i think from the early reaction of our new colleagues from tcf and the branches theyre wildly enthusiastic and i think the customer base will be as well i see theres a big growth opportunity for us including our capacity to crosssell so the operating processes procedures et cetera we have complemented by our fair play products and this emphasis and focus on customer service i think is going to make our combination incredibly powerful on the consumer side im very bullish there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and i think we were competing with the weve been competing with fintechs and the larger banks in our footprint for years its actually made us better so were well we look forward to continuing to adapt and innovate and yet grow on the consumer banking business ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful steve thank you and just as a followup i think that the other side of steves question you have been relatively acquisitive over the last few years as you get through the tcf integration over the next few quarters just talk to us in terms of need for ma either in terms of scale or expanding geographies like is any of that a priority over the medium term or not stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well our focus is on yeah completing this integration well delivering the economics or better and driving the core and thats going to thats the focus so were really grateful and pleased with the talented new colleagues we have joining us theres a training natural absorption that will go on over the next year or so and again thats where were focused ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 got it thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question is from brian foran with autonomous please proceed brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hi im just thinking over the next couple of quarters i mean its always tough with these deals to figure out whats really going on well clearly we have the benefit of your qualitative comments and youve been very clear that youre upbeat on whats going on so far but if you put yourself in our shoes for the next six to nine months and youre kind of picking up the financials every quarter are there two or three things that you would say look these are the you should watch for these three metrics and this is kind of whats going to be good and this is whats going to be this is what would be the benchmark you should really focus on for the next six to nine months basically i pick up the third quarter financials and im trying to figure out are things going well what would be the two or three things you would really key in on zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question this is zach and i fully understand it and frankly internally what were very much focus on is ensuring we have visibility as well and what im watching is i think the same things you shared which is the sequential loan growth from where we stand today as i mentioned i think itll be somewhat flattish here in the backhalf of the year but i do think the conditions will be improving and well be watching that line utilization that drag as it goes away will kind of reveal the underlying strength in the new production well i think would be the driver thats sort of point one point two is the nim that as we talked about our expectation is in the i think thatll move potentially based on the pace of the deposit runoff and that kind of basis points of elevated liquidity drag coming off i have confidence in our forecast with a lot of actions and specific plans to drive it but i think thats the thing i would watch secondly third we havent talked about it a lot here but fees are a real bright spot for us in terms of the strategic focus areas for our strategy and the growth that its driving principally in those four areas i mentioned in my comments card and payments just getting the commercial card business card just on fire treasury management continued to track forward very very well our capital markets business is growing very nicely yearoveryear and sequentially and then wealth and investments which are seeing record sales activity and really strong revenue growth as well so id watch those very carefully and then i think lastly the expenses i think we got a question earlier about the trajectory of expenses i do think theyll pop up just from a kind of calendarization perspective into the third quarter as we have a full quarter of tcf and then youll see it every quarter tick down on a nominal basis over the next few quarters as our synergies are realized kind of wavebywave basis and then getting to that run rate level of performance that are in our mediumterm targets as we get into the second half of and as we certainly go into the full year of so thats our operating plan and thats really what i would urge you to stay focused on as well huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc brian additionally the credit profile will continue to improve weve tried to be conservative with both our marks and our use of discretionary indiscernible as it relates to the new tcf portfolio and youll see improvement on credit class npa npl net chargeoffs as well brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp thats really great i appreciate all the detail from both of you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks brian operator our next question is from david konrad with kbw please proceed david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes good morning i was just wondering if you could help us out a little bit on next quarters expenses make sure were all kind of in the range of the same starting point as you put tcf together with hban for the full quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i hate to give sort of overly precise guidance but my expectation exonetimers that will popup a couple hundred million dollars is just the run rate into next quarter so around billion of run rate expenses ex onetimers and then starting to tick down from there david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the sorry theres one more question from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey jon go ahead huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc jon youre on jon arfstrom jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc im here thank you sorry thanks for letting me sneak in question for you back on steves on the eps question it sounds like youre pretty optimistic on credit can you give us some idea of what youre thinking in terms of provisioning as well are we still on this reserve reduction credit improvement mode for the company or are there any nuances in terms of how youve marked tcf and what you see on credit where were going to flip back to a positive provision richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey jon its rich let me take that so from my standpoint weve been releasing reserves now for two quarters and within that were seeing the positive impacts on the economy and our credit metrics are continuing to improve with the tcf mark we spent a lot of time on that we feel we have it absolutely right and so we would not expect to have to build reserves from here we continue to expect the economy to improve and our credit metrics as steve just mentioned we also expect to see reductions in credit class and npas and chargeoffs continuing a downward trend so if all of that holds true i would expect to see continued releases moving forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good steve when does fair play come into the tcf markets and what kind of an impact do you expect that to have stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well jon well be introducing huntington products when we do the conversion on columbus day and i think that will be the moment where with some advertising or marketing along with the highly engaged new colleagues from tcf well be able to really make ph hay with what were talking about here we have to get through the conversion and settle it down usually takes a couple of weeks but we have such great products in comparison that theyre very our indiscernible colleagues are very very enthusiastic and so its an exciting moment for us well translate that into our customer base and well be launching marketing campaigns in advance to sort of set up the momentum that we hope to deliver remember when we announced tcf deal we talked about the expense takeout being half the equation but we were optimistic about the revenue potential in this and its not been sized it wasnt sized for discussion then its not today but its looking really good and we have a great group of new colleagues that will be able to deliver this for us so were very optimistic about our future together jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay you kind of hit on what i wanted to ask also but do you have any early revenue synergy examples that you can share i know you dont want to size it but any examples so far huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well ive done a lot of calling and so the vignettes that im picking up from customers our customers tcf customers even prospects are very very encouraging weve remember we have a much broader set of products and services than tcf so when were sitting around talking about what we can do like i think it was yesterday with a very large middlemarket company and theyre asking us questions on a detailed basis about the venue tcf just didnt have those products and capabilities and so being able to introduce those into a discussion are looked very very promising i think therell be a year relationship were going to move from one of our competitors so again this combination has a lot of potential and the breadth of our products and services both on the business and commercial side and the service side are very encouraging zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc this is zach i might just tackle on to that one here too indiscernible i think about the synergies im equally bullish about it as steve just is i always think about them sort in a few major buckets theres the sort of deepening engagement with products i think commercial capital markets treasury management our card and commercial card payments businesses and consumer all the things that steve just referenced in terms of elevated level of share of wallet given the stronger products and an accelerated acquisition given the particularly the digital capabilities and then lastly geographic opportunity for us to expand into the new big markets denver minneapolis deepening into a lot of the markets that we exist today i think were already beginning to hire staff and really start to penetrate those markets so those are the three buckets that im seeing stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so were moving fairly quickly just to pick up on zach so we can indiscernible this a little bit were ahead of the hiring and were ahead of the pro forma on our commercial our wealth business banking in a couple as new markets and the power of the combination in terms of just the sheer magnitude of what we have in michigan and chicago is very very exciting to us so a lot of work to do in front of us thats where were focused on driving organic growth and getting this integration in great shape but we like what we see jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks a lot very helpful and mark congrats and thanks for all the help over the years i appreciate it mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks jon stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well said huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys just can you remind us on your on the mediumterm goals for roe and efficiency ratio just what your timeframe is for that and then also how do you contemplate what rates and credit you build into that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach ill take that one great question i appreciate the opportunity to elaborate and be more specific so medium term for us its really kind of the next four to eight quarters as i mentioned in my prepared remarks and in a few questions i think youll see the deal economics sort of accrue very substantially into and theyll kind of build over the course of the year where the run rates particularly in the second half of the year will be very much evident of that and then the fullyear should very much be those metrics and so thats our focus so backhalf into and i think the credit environment that were envisioning and the indiscernible continued tracking forward of benefits and as rich just noted in his answer just a few moments ago that probably will represent some incremental reserve releases here mainly in the backhalf of i would expect and then on the forward yield curve basis really just planning on the forward yield curve as it exists today so you can see that too it still represents a constructive environment particularly as you get kind of through and into the course of but really on a nim basis that will manifest itself into the which is my forecast sort of over that entire period ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then just one followup on the merger saves so with the conversions finalizing in october is it fair to say that well get full run rate saves in and then on top of that like how do you feel just about your original costsave forecast do you see any potential upside and if there were to be upside do you expect to let that fall or could you reinvest some of it thanks guys zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah good ph additional questions in terms of the cost its still very much on track to deliver what we committed and thats the number were really aiming for and its not sort of a perfect step down of cost as you sort of alluded potentially as a form of your question really there are sort of think about tranches of cost reductions that will begin as i mentioned in the fourth quarter and start to kind of each quarter thereafter drive incremental benefits on a quartertoquarter basis really by the second half of the year youll sort of see the full totality of it theres a few pieces that will carry forward in terms of additional execution into the early part of next year so see steady reduction in expenses starting for at q4 and then continuing for about four or five quarters thereafter hopefully thats helpful operator our next question is again from brian foran with autonomous please proceed huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hi i just want to circle back to that expense number and definitely recognize you mentioned youre not trying to give point guidance but now ill ask you about point guidance just to make sure im not misinterpreting it zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks for that brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp so youre saying start with billion and then add a couple hundred million so something like billion billion but with a wide range i just want make sure like zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no no let me clarify let me clarify brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i think indiscernible looking at the number its roughly million higher quartertoquarter on a growth rate just a nominal basis from q2 into q3 thats just the sort of ph quarterlization if you will of the full quarter of tcf run rate expenses before many of the synergies start to take place so precisely roughly million quartertoquarter higher in expenses exonetimers into q3 brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp and the base thats higher off of is roughly billion ph even or whats million higher than what zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah the numbers i am looking at are million so im not sure what the numbers youre looking we can take it offline to help you clarify more precisely brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp got it okay but you said the number youre looking at is what zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc its the brightest number in the earnings release at the onetime items thats the million is the starting point huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp million okay perfect no thats exactly what i was trying to clarify i was working off the wrong base okay so million higher off million with obviously lots of moving parts around integration and stuff so thats kind of a range to start rather than a point guidance zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc i think thats a good way to take away brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp i appreciate that i was about to plug in a number that was about too high in my models so thanks for that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc glad we could clarify that brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah appreciate it zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks brian operator our next question is from bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on the outlook for loan growth to be flat in the second half but improving in and wanted to ask if you could tie that outlook in with whats implicit in that outlook relative to the commentary you had around labor force shortages continuing and just to the extent that the expectation is that thats going to improve as we look to the fall and beyond as extended unemployment benefits forbearance and other stimulus sort of abate is that sort of the expectation thats contributing to that or maybe just some color on whats implicit in that outlook stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc its this is steve bill you have an environment that is changing is improving we hope on the employment side that is the number one issue for businesses at least in our footprint they just cant get enough labor and so the change in benefits we hope will spur more employment which will translate over time to higher growth rates and financing needs but its not an immediate correlation it just takes some period of time to burn in and we expect that well see that feel it and experience it during the fourth quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2021 but theres also with the 10year reduction theres some level of prepayment that we would expect to occur on some of our portfolio so were trying to incorporate all of the changes with the guidance that youve got from zach were not optimistic that line utilizations improve in any material sense this year at this point and that is the thats a bit of a change from where we were at the end of the first quarter bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and i wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on the auto side of the business and ask if you could give some color on your discussions with your dealer clients in terms of what youre hearing from them around their appetite for keeping floor plan levels lower versus history even after the supply chain issues are resolved how are you guys thinking about the possibility that we could end up below historical levels of inventory stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc that reminds me of and when the bankruptcies occurred and inventories were drawn down and at that point everybodys going to keep floor plans levels lower and the car companies are going to be more judicious during the pricing versus volume and that lasted for a couple of quarters right there is a volume share gain that history has shown that the oems want and they have the ability to push delivery so not just the dealers pulling it so we believe over time the floor plan inventories will exceptionally get back to where they were a lot of the dealers particularly in the slow rate environment would love to have a lot more inventory and theyre getting deliveries and in a good percentage of the cases theyre those are presold so theyre on the ph lag very briefly and theres still a phenomenon where people come in thinking they know what they want but theyre once they experience the next version up or the additional features that are available in the car that theres a sales process and generally a selection that still has some physical components in it so i think the dealers will be essentially in the position they were back in and over time now i dont think thats a and it may not even fully be in but by we think that theyll be normalized assuming the pandemic stays under control bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you steve thats helpful stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks bill mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc steve before we move on to next just real quick we got

boards decision well be rerunning our models with tcf data and look at them our priorities havent changed organic growth dividend and all other use at this point thats about as far as i can go at this
