we arent obligated to update them we will also address our adjusted results in our remarks which are nongaap measures and please review the gaap information in our supplement and on page of our presentation and so now im going to give it to bryan d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you ellen good morning everyone thank you for joining our call i guess it would be the understatement of the year to say was not an unusual year it was a very unusual year and it proved to be one of unprecedented challenges not only for our industry but for our economy our society im extremely pleased however with the great work that first horizon has accomplished in we continue to serve our customers our communities and our associates throughout the pandemic with ppp loans charitable contributions and by offering our associates increased flexibility and benefits while demonstrating prudent risk management weve made impressive progress on the integration of our moe despite the pandemic enhancing our scale and providing opportunities to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in attractive markets we also continue to focus on delivering strong shareholder value fourth quarter results were solid with continued relative underlying strength in ppnr given resilient results in our countercyclical businesses and continued expense discipline loan demand remained muted given current continued economic and political uncertainty however our lower risk loans to mortgage companies business has provided some nice offset to these headwinds at the same time we continued to make progress on our lower funding lowering our funding cost in the face of increasing levels of liquidity on the expense front we generated a total of million of annualized mergerrelated cost saves in the quarter and now have increased our initial target of a net million to million our capital levels remain healthy first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 with the cet1 ratio of nearly up basis points from last quarter to and we grew tangible book value per share by to at quarter end reflecting ongoing earnings momentum we also believe were well reserved for future loan losses given the benefit of the merger accounting and prudent stance on reserves and our internal stress test results in december highlight our ability to navigate the feds severely adverse economic scenario with more than adequate capital levels as well as a lower risk nature of our loan portfolios it is important to note that as we entered the year we are increasingly optimistic about our path to economic recovery as we expect to see the rollout of vaccines accelerate nearterm providing benefits in the back half of the year but we will continue to monitor the landscape carefully we remain confident in this excuse me we remain confident that the strength of our highly attractive franchise and the benefits of our merger of equals position us well to capitalize on tremendous opportunity when the pandemicrelated slowdown ends and we are strongly committed to delivering top quartile returns over the medium term with that ill hand it over to bj bj d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks bryan and good morning everybody before we dive into the results lets start on slide and take a look at some notable and other unusual items that we had in the quarter just to level set as bryan mentioned were really pleased with the performance this quarter as we delivered gaap eps of or on an adjusted basis which excludes notable items related to merger integration costs outlined on the lefthand section of this slide we also highlight for you on this slide some other items of a nonrecurring nature that you might find helpful as you consider and review our results and outlook these items resulted in a net million reduction to our results as you can see on the righthand of the slide revenue was reduced by approximately million which included a million reduction in nii largely tied to the trueup of annualized costs of a promotional credit card offering that we did in late that resulted from an operational issue in mailing disclosures to customers that werent eligible for the lower rate we went ahead and we corrected this but determined that we should honor those promotional rates to those customers in december we also opportunistically repositioned part of the securities portfolio which near term resulted in a million loss which you can see in the other noninterest income line but it will provide a nice nii benefit going forward in december we announced a onetime bonus to employees making less than and we determined that we should allow a covidrelated rollover of some unused vacation time these two items totaled million in the quarter and finally our other noninterest expense reflects a reduction in regulatory costs largely fdic expense resulting from the close of the quarter and the merger which lowered other noninterest expense by million on the following pages weve highlighted our adjusted results before the impact of these unusual items which we believe provides a better view of our underlying earnings momentum first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 moving to slide for some highlights of our adjusted financials we saw adjusted ppnr of million a decrease of million linked quarter largely driven by that net million reduction on unusual items that we just went over while seasonality impacted some of our fee businesses overall trends were solid despite continued nii headwinds adjusting for the unusual items our revenue expenses and ppnr were all relatively stable relative to the third quarter provision expense decreased to million on million of net chargeoffs reflecting a million reserve release given the improving economic outlook solid ppnr and modest provision resulted in tangible book value per share growth of linked quarter and helped drive our rotce up over in the quarter as well even as our capital ratios increased turning to net interest income on slide we generated nii of million down million linked quarter driven by a million reduction in net mergerrelated and ppp loan benefits as well as the million reduction from those unusual items so stepping back and looking at it on an underlying basis our core nii improved million before unusual items to million as the million reduction in deposit funding costs more than offset the impact of a modest decline in average loan and securities portfolio balances linked quarter weve continued to focus on lowering our interestbearing deposit costs which you can see reduced by an additional basis points in the quarter to basis points and we continue to push that even lower with a target of about basis points by yearend reported nim came in at in down from in largely reflecting a basis point decrease in merger and ppp benefits as well as a basis point decline from the unusual items as you would expect we also continue to see elevated levels of excess liquidity weigh on the margin with our average excess cash up about billion in the quarter which pressured the margin by basis points as we ended the quarter with approximately billion of excess cash as weve discussed in the past this doesnt influence net interest income much but as we look forward to the year and the impact of incremental government relief were likely to see further pressure on the margin nearterm from those elevated cash balances now moving on to slide and a review of our fee income results countercyclical fee businesses particularly fixed income and mortgage banking continued to deliver strong results in the quarter and this quarter they were helped by higher depositrelated fee income as well fixed income average daily revenue of million was relatively stable from the third quarter to fourth quarter fixed income fees themselves decreased million linked quarter largely reflecting the impact of day count and lower fees in ancillary products but we continued to produce strong average daily revenues at that million level mortgage banking fees also remained fairly strong despite seasonally lower production with fee income of million and further expansion on gain on sale spreads which were up basis points additionally we saw service charges rebound to near precovid levels up million in the quarter driven by higher cash management fees and we also saw modest improvements among all other categories both fixed income and mortgage banking were up significantly yearoveryear in the fourth quarter demonstrating the considerable offset to the rate pressures that these businesses provide us to our overall results turning to expenses on slide we continue to demonstrate our commitment to expense discipline our adjusted expense remained relatively stable even with the net million impact tied to unusual items and incentives and commissions as well as other noninterest expense total personnel costs were up million in the quarter first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 including million of costs tied to our onetime employee bonus and vacation accrual and importantly we continue to make progress towards our new target of million of merger saves with an incremental million or a total of million in the quarter in this low growth and low rate environment we think we are well positioned to continue to manage expenses down to help improve profitability and returns turning to the balance sheet on slides and we provide a view of our loan growth and our funding profile and as expected our average in periodend loans decreased as customer demand remained soft payoffs remained high and utilization rates have stabilized however as a countercyclical business our loans to mortgage companies posted average linked quarter growth of roughly million reflecting strong volume tied to the low rate environment on the liability side periodend deposits were up billion from last quarter reflecting an increase in interest bearing and demand deposits active management of our interestbearing deposit costs drove a decrease of basis points to basis points overall we also further improved our funding profile as borrowings decreased by about million from we will continue to evaluate ways to deploy our excess cash balances and seek additional opportunities as i talked about to decrease those costs of funds starting with slide and looking at asset quality we are very pleased with our overall positioning here credit is performing much better than any of us would have imagined at the start of the pandemic net chargeoffs improved to basis points down from unusually high levels in the third quarter which were driven by the energy portfolio and nonperforming loans decreased to basis points as i said earlier in the quarter we had million in net chargeoffs with million of that energyrelated therefore the rest of the portfolio more broadly had only million in net chargeoffs outstanding performance as you can see on slide we decreased our overall allowance for credit losses by million and as weve done since the adoption of cecl we utilized moodys scenarios and then incorporated other economic and portfolio factors to evaluate the reserve if you look at slide we provide an updated view of those portfolios that investors had been most focused on in the wake of the pandemic and we continue to do very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected by covid19 that has resulted in a decrease in those portfolios subject to a heightened level of monitoring we now have roughly of loans that are subject to that monitoring we provide a data in the appendix as well on the reserve coverage by portfolio in addition to information on deferrals which improved to less than of total loan balances from down from last quarter again we feel very comfortable with our risk profile and our reserve levels moving quickly to capital on page as i mentioned before tangible book value per share of was up on strong earnings which with addition to a reduction in riskweighted assets helped drive that basis point improvement in our cet ratio to and very importantly with tangible book value per share now at and growing the iberia merger of equals is now accretive to tangible book value after only six months well ahead of the over twoyear earnback we estimated at announcement moving on to slide in merger integration theres a lot of great work going on here weve finalized our three year strategic plan which is focused on capitalizing on the organic growth opportunities across our new expanded franchise on the people side we continue to align teams and cultures were seeing good retention and over the last quarter weve implemented new sales and credit team structures as well first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 operationally weve already consolidated our mortgage platforms weve launched a new and improved wire system weve completed major upgrades to the online banking systems as well we also combined procurement and expense systems continued to streamline corporate real estate with much more to come in the fourth quarter we delivered million in cost savings providing that annualized benefit of million as we entered and as we noted earlier we upsized the targeted annualized cost saves to million which we expect to achieve by the first half of and as you can see weve provided an estimated timeline for those cost saves on the righthand part of this slide slide weve provided an overview of our expectations for both the first quarter and the full year but its really important to note as bryan alluded to earlier that as we enter the year the macro environment remains highly uncertain with more variability than any of us would like the progression of the rollout of the vaccine and its efficacy will matter a great deal of course as will the pace and influence of government relief as it ripples across the economy however as the newly combined company were committed to enhance transparency as we work to drive shareholder value and our outlook reflects our current view that we will continue to see a prolonged low rate environment given current fed posturing but with an economic recovery beginning in the second half of the year as headwinds from the pandemic hopefully subside for our fullyear outlook we provided an annualized baseline thats based on our fourth quarter results and from that we expect a low to midsingle digit percent decline in nii given the outlook for muted loan growth and moderating impacts from net accretion relative to that baseline while we anticipate a continued relatively strong environment nearterm for our mortgage and fixed income businesses our outlook reflects a low teens decrease in fees from strong annualized levels and our mortgage origination outlook largely corresponds with the nbas outlook on the expense front we expect noninterest expense to be down in the low to midsingle digit range with results excluding incentives and commissions down low single digits as weve noted our ongoing focus on efficiency and cost saves should result in an expense decline over the next year the range in provision expense could be significant and its going to be largely dependent on the forward outlook but we expect net chargeoff performance to be strong somewhere in the range of to basis points and if that occurs given an acl excluding loans to mortgage companies and ppp of a little over we are very well positioned to see lower provisions as opposed to higher provisions if that outlook does come to fruition finally we expect to see our cet1 ratio come in around reflecting the expectation for riskweighted assets to be modestly lower and the potential to opportunistically repurchase shares over the course of the year weve also provided our outlook for the first quarter in the context of this overall guidance for the year hopefully thats helpful and as bryan mentioned we feel good about the positioning and our ability to perform well given the environment so quickly wrapping up on slide were wellpositioned over the longterm to capitalize on the opportunities of our more diversified business model and our highly attractive southern franchise our countercyclical businesses are proving out their ability to help mitigate pressure from lower rates we believe the advantage of merger cost saves is a differentiator and that our approach to risk management should help us mitigate credit losses with the benefit of significant loss absorption while the economic environment remains challenging and loan demand soft gives us the ability to maintain our strong focus on merger integration over the next year and ultimately we continue to believe were wellpositioned on a relative basis to deliver top quartile returns first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 so with that ill turn it back to bryan d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you bj our strong balance sheet capital and liquidity will serve us well in this difficult environment weve maintained underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability despite the economic headwinds we are positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale better efficiency and improved earnings power to create shareholder value and as bj said our outlook for is constructive thank you to all our associates for their hard work serving our customers our communities and helping deliver value for our shareholders grant well now open it up for questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey guys good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch by the great job on the outlook and guidance bj so thank you but just a question around net loan growth give us a sense of one what you see understand the year is going to start out slow but just talk to us given sort of the combined capability within first horizon and iberia how you see loan growth trending if the economy continues to reopen and then your outlook on the mortgage warehouse business as well despite the decline forecasted by the ph mba do you expect to outperform the market william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah ebrahim thanks for the question as we look at we see loan growth as we talked about maybe modestly down on an average basis but theres a lot of moving parts in there one is clearly on ppp loans we expect that the first round of ppp loans to come off quite substantially by the end of the year and with them first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 starting at about billion we expect a couple of billion or more of runoff there theyll be replenished by the new ppp loans coming on but we dont expect at this point to have the same type of balances the second round as we saw in the first so thats a little bit of the decline the second is broadly speaking in consumer and commercial lending loan growth is generally muted across our markets and so particularly in the first half of the year we have lower expectations of demand though we did have in our most recent month our strongest production month that weve seen in the last so thats encouraging but its still muted on the flip side though we do see strength in our assetbased lending business which has done quite well over the last quarter or so and the mortgage company business notwithstanding the nba outlook has generated a significant amount of customer relationships over time as you well know and we are very bullish on the outlook for the outstandings in that business to continue to grow over the course of the year seasonality would we would expect its a little bit lower in the first quarter but then picking up fairly materially in the second through the fourth so we expect loans to mortgage companies to be stronger in the back half of the year than even the levels that we saw in the fourth quarter so thats kind of a little bit of color on how we see the loan growth but there are definitely pockets of opportunity one more thing i would say is if the economy does open up in the second half of the year our businesses have been doing an extraordinary amount of work cultivating customers cultivating relationships looking for new opportunities being prepared to take advantage of those such that when demand does come back we are wellpositioned so were very very focused on business momentum susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee ebrahim a few just a couple of more i guess details to add what bj said as he mentioned that december we saw good both strong production its the strongest month we had in but it was also very broadbased we saw it in our specialty businesses but we also saw it in our markets across tennessee louisiana north carolina florida i mean we saw and then we saw it in the specialty businesses that bj highlighted and the revenue synergies that were seeing with the referrals and assetbased lending equipment finance theres a lot of excitement with our bankers about those capabilities now that weve merged these two great companies so i feel good about the opportunities in the there are strong company opportunities for us to either grow with or bring into the company ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and exppp in the mortgage warehouse is there any portfolio where you expect a runoff william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee a runoff as an intentional runoff ebrahim h q poonawala analyst bank of america merrill lynch yeah no like where you see balances declining in a meaningful way first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so clearly as weve talked about earlier were highly cautious on the energy portfolio and have been letting that run down were not actively running off any other portfolios per se but payoffs have been outpacing new originations across many of our markets and in several of our businesses but like susan and i just talked about we just had our strongest month so there may be signs that activity is picking up a little bit were still expecting though that doesnt really start to occur until the back half of the year as the front half ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for taking my questions ill requeue operator our next question will come from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe i guess starting with the allowance and the expectation for pretty strong credit performance i guess how much are you depending on cecl qualitative overlay to support a higher level of allowance here and then connected to that when you look at the loans that were acquired that were doublecounted with both a provision and a mark are you able to release any of that reserve before those loans either payoff you realize that accretion from the market william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so ill start so as you know on the cecl reserves a lot of the quantitative modeling is based on what the scenarios are going to tell you in the weightings around the scenarios and so if we start with that and you think through what the moodys scenarios have done over the course of the year ie continue to improve those quantitative models are telling us that reserves should come down in a lot of places meaningfully come down and so we start with those but then theres there are overlays that we put on quantitate qualitatively around those areas of perceived risk across the portfolios because given though those models are telling us that we still think its a little too early to declare victory on the economy and the recovery particularly with the uncertainty around the vaccine rollout and so on and so there has been a fair amount of qualitative overlay that we have put first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 on those quantitative models so far so thats why our reserves coverage ended relatively stable to the third quarter but i would tell you that if our outlook holds again on net chargeoffs in the to range and weve got an acl in the range its were going to have a lot of reserve release coming in if those kind of metrics start to play out so that would be my expectation is our provision comes down pretty meaningfully jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and i guess shifting to capital management your comments around the buyback i guess one could you be in the market now if you wanted to be or do we need to wait for a reauthorization or any other type of authorization and then i guess second to that would there be other uses of capital theres certainly an expectation that ma picks up over the coming year now that youve had the success with ibkc would you be interested in potentially being back in the market d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hi jared this is bryan good morning the we have a current authorizations which would allow us to get back in the market and as you would expect we talk constantly with our board about capital and capital levels so we have the ability to repurchase shares i would emphasize our first and foremost goal is to reinvest capital organically in the business and were as we said expecting fairly muted loan growth in the first part of the year but when that picks up we want to put capital to work in the business so that will be primary objective number one we will well look at inorganic opportunities but i would suggest that given all that we have on our plate to complete the integration of moe of iberiabank in first horizon its unlikely that were going to get interested or engaged in any ma activity we want to put these two organizations together to do that well and then show that we can operate these businesses in such a way that we deliver on the revenue synergies that weve talked about well deliver on the cost synergies as upsize and we think weve got a powerful franchise that we can grow organically ill go back to one of the key points that weve made a number of times but most prominently in november of the footprint that we have put together is expected to grow at a pace faster than the us as a whole and i would suggest given some of the postcovid impacts that pace will actually pick up some just based on the relocation of people and some of the demographic changes so were pretty optimistic about the footprint we have and we think we can create a lot of value with that so i would say if i had to summarize that a indiscernible focus on putting capital work in the business organically and to the extent that in the near term we cant do that well look for opportunities to repatriate it to our shareholders jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for the insights d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee youre welcome thank you operator our next question will come from jennifer demba with truist securities please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning you said that the company finalized its threeyear strategic plan recently i was just wondering if you could go over some of the nuances that investors may be more interested in right now d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee well yes jennifer good morning this is bryan ill start and then bj or susan pick up i think the biggest nuance that i would focus on really goes back to jareds question which is this is a strategy that deals with operating the business that we have and then capitalizing on the strength of the footprint that we have we have built it at a very granular level we involved the entire leadership team and really the expanded leadership team we built it from the market levels up and we spent a lot of time thinking about markets we thought about our lines of businesses and our specialty businesses then when we pull it all together we think that the key things that we need to execute on are one investing in talent in people and making sure that we position ourselves to take advantage of the demographic opportunities that we have control costs in such a way that we fund that and then the other big theme is to continually think about how we reallocate our infrastructure costs to improve our products and our services and youll see as we get through this integration that were doing a lot of work between now and the final integration of the two companies sometime later this year to improve products and services and close any gaps in those that we have so were continually evolving the business but really focused on the blocking and tackling of taking advantage of the growth opportunities we see in this footprint jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks a lot d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee youre welcome thank you operator our next question will come from ken zerbe whos with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey ken susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was actually hoping you actually talked about the million of cost saves for the revised million how much of that falls to the bottom line versus being reinvested and i guess the reason i ask that is because it looks like your new guidance is pretty much consistent with kind of what at least our expectations were which implies a lot of it gets reinvested but i would love your thoughts thank you d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee well ken this is bryan i expect what youll see is that those cost savings will drop to the bottom line the guidance or the outlook slide thats there exists for and most of those cost savings will come in later in and really apply to so our expectation is that they drop to the bottom line just like the original million commitment that we laid out ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great and then just a quick one obviously a lot of notable items totally get it given the acquisition or the merger when you think about the notable items which do kind of distort your core underlying results like at what point to do those items start to phase out in terms of the quarters thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think ken my expectation is that towards the end of the year the difference between reported and adjusted is going to be very modest yeah there will still be some notable items or mergerrelated charges that might slip into the first half of but my expectation would be that theyre largely gone by the end of this year ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much operator our next question will come from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee steve are you there operator steven your line may be muted on your end susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yes grant lets go ahead and take the next question operator okay one moment the next question will come from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everybody william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brock susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc i appreciated the color on the reserve obviously the potential for a reserve recapture is pretty full here how do you or how should we think about the appropriate level of reserves on the backside of this i think thats one thing analysts struggle with is is it how low does it prudently go william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so ken ive spent a lot of time in d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee brock william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee brock thank you ive spent a lot of time thinking about this so as susan if you just use day one cecl as maybe a baseline for a precovid environment i think our reserve level with day one cecl on a combined basis would have been about in aggregate and were well above that right now if you look at end of the first quarter which may be still has a little bit of pandemic in there theres its maybe basis points right so i think over time we tend back towards those ive heard commentary from other banks saying if we get back to precovid levels that by the end of this year im not sure that were totally back there by the end of this year but if you just do math on our metrics going back to precovid levels would imply a couple hundred million dollars of reserve release which is pretty massive it happened in one year so i think were all still trying to get used to cecl and understand the variability in the outlooks but bottom line as i think theres a lot more bias towards us releasing reserves a lot more than there is having to even hold it much less increase it this year first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and just shifting over to funding youve been working down your cd book youve been dropping that rate as well similar trend with the borrowings how much flex do you have in those two categories to either lower balances or lower the rate william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so ill start with the borrowings first so the borrowings we were still carrying essentially two holdco debt maturities one of which we obviously retired in the fourth quarter so that drove a lot of our borrowings down so i expect those to say probably relatively stable maybe down a little bit as we try to optimize it on time deposits theyve been relatively low because we just hadnt seen a lot of mix shift towards those even as the rate environment was more favorable to doing those so largely where we see cd balances today are in our small virtual bank and maybe scattered across some of our markets so yeah theres some opportunity to continue to move time deposits down as they mature but i think most of our emphasis and the great work that our bankers have done have been around dialogue with our commercial clients and then making sure that our base rates on the consumer side are competitive but in line with what were seeing in our various markets so i think theres a little bit more opportunity to effect change in our interestbearing deposits around our money market and savings accounts on consumer and commercial brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you for the color d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee sure thank you operator next question will come from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks good morning guys william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee hi brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 so i think in the past you guys have talked about a lowdoubledigit roe as a guideline you just printed an number so pretty far above that can you just remind us what were you referring to when you were talking about the lowdoubledigit roe and is there potentially an update to that number william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah we just printed the update of just kidding yeah i think when we were talking about the lowdouble digit it clearly had an expectation of much higher than million of provision right so that was certainly helpful but i think we on a relative basis we continue to believe that we can generate top tier returns on tangible equity and i think as ive looked at consensus estimates for even and what i expect our company to do or what we expect our company to do we definitely believe it will generate those top tier returns and so will it be over time no it wont be that high could it be like that for a while if provisioning is low yeah in the mid teens range could be a good expectation but its all going to depend on what the provision looks like over the next several quarters brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then i wanted to revisit the buyback i mean youre already over the target on common equity tier you talked about riskweighted assets going down this year youre going to be profitable this year so thats going to push that ratio even higher i mean it seems you have a stock thats still pretty cheap ph at of tangible i mean it seems like the opportunity to engage in the buyback is real do you realistically expect to get out there and be aggressive with the buyback this year d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee brady this is bryan im not going to bite on aggressive because thats a term of art as opposed to science look i think youre right i think we would show in our outlook that our capital ratios could continue to build if we didnt reinvest or repatriate capital to our shareholders and so we will take the opportunity when we can to repurchase some shares we tend to believe much like you do that we think its an attractive valuation and we think its a good longterm use of the capital so we will use it we will continue to dialogue with our board i think its really important to say as youd think about capital in terms of being aggressive or not theres still a fair number of questions in terms of the pandemic that have to be resolved and weve laid out sort of our expectation one of the keys is that we see a pickup in the rollout of vaccinations i would say todate its been woefully inadequate and its got to pick up for us to see a much stronger back half of the year i believe we can do that as more vaccines become available and the corollary to that is what happens with these more virulent strains and do they are more at least more transmissible strains of covid and do they result in more slowdown shutdown stayathome orders on a national basis so in terms of how we think about it were still cautiously optimistic about but were going to let this thing unfold a little bit before we start to bring capital ratios down real rapidly and well look at opportunities to buy the stock over brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally for me an easy one i mean bjs tax rate was all over the place last year which i get given the volatility in profitability but i think in the past youve talked about an effective tax rate around is that the right way to think about it from here first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think so its i was thinking the to range somewhere right in there brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks guys william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question will come from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey just wanted to dig into the fee income outlook a little bit you mentioned strengthening fixed income and mortgage obviously theres some seasonality components can you just maybe walk us through some of the expectations for those businesses and how that might kind of reconcile to the guidance a little bit more specifically thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure so ill start with mortgage i said in my earlier comments that we dont have a view thats much different or more wellinformed than the mortgage bankers association would have so i think that shows some modest growth in purchase origination volume and meaningful decline in refinances so in aggregate i think yearoveryear originations down in the range is what the mba would be talking about in terms of fixed income we still see quite an opportunity in fixed income with the longer end of the curve continuing to inch up and yield curve steepening still a lot of volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace weve still seen strong volumes in fixed income as a matter of fact in the fourth quarter of the days had over a million of revenue in the quarter and we expect that to continue over the next few quarters so we expect fixed income to stay pretty strong relative to fourth quarter levels does that help first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc yes it does and maybe its a little bit too early to discuss quantitatively but where are the biggest areas you see for kind of revenue synergies at this point i remember with a capital bank deal you guys did laid out some revenue synergies i dont know if you did the same thing this time but it would seem like youre putting these two franchise together the opportunity could be fairly significant so maybe if you can just discuss that broadly thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure absolutely so yes we continue to track our revenue synergies we started as of june excuse me july and so theyre still fairly modest given the muted growth opportunities that were seeing but its in the million annualized revenue range at this point and thats early in a in an uncertain environment so we think thats going to be well ahead of the 30plusmillion that we saw in capital bank obviously and so as activity picks up were wellpositioned to capture a lot of revenue synergy and over time as we get a little bit more of that im sure that well share that with you and show you a little bit more color on where thats coming from d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee there is michael this is bryan areas that were really seeing great opportunities or products like wealth management and the overlay to the former iberia portion of the franchise opportunities like mortgage origination with the overlay to the former first horizon portion of the franchise our asset base lending business our equipment finance business were entertaining were actually closing deals in all of those areas just to name a few so all of our specialty areas international is one where were having a great deal of conversation so we really see revenue synergy opportunities over a broad swath of the products and our bankers are excited about it theyre spending a lot of time on it and theyre making an awful lot of referrals and bj quoted a sort of a revenue number annualized we think the pipeline is probably that big or bigger at this point and as i said setting back in the early december timeframe the words i used were something like well probably blow away the million of revenue synergies that we saw a lot of capital bank we just think that its a huge opportunity for us operator our next question will come from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning john d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee good morning john first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc just want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on what drove the upsizing of the cost saves i believe you had commented on that at an earlier presentation in the quarter but just wanted a little bit of the color behind that and then secondly does that upsizing consider incremental rationalization of your real estate both on the corporate real estate side as well as branches just given the added impact or influence of the pandemic on top of the merger itself thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure john its bj so as we kind of alluded to from the beginning we were very confident in our net million when we announced it as we started to look deeper we continued to see more opportunities and then of course the pandemic has accelerated changes in customer behavior which has allowed us to further look at physical branch distribution opportunities for consolidation as well as what you said the real estate side and so as we started to quantify those we got more and more confident in exceeding the million which is why we upsized it we do believe though that theyll come more towards a postintegration world which were currently still targeting for the end of this year in terms of the large systems integration but thatll involve a lot of real estate related things as we take out more cost john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thanks bj and then separately just back to the buybacks just for a quick clarification is there anything on the regulatory front that is keeping you from stepping in just yet on buybacks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee not that were aware of no john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it all right thats it from me thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee all right operator our next question will come from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone can you hear me now william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey steve d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey steve susan l springfield a chief credit officer executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello okay so first on expenses so on huntingtons call this morning they talked about stepping up the pace of investment near term to better position for an eventual recovery and you guys are guiding down expenses in with cost saves a factor but can you comment on the pace of investment going on behind the scenes is it pretty steady or you guys are also increasing the pace d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah this is bryan steve were i would say we look to increase the pace in i didnt listen obviously to huntingtons call this morning but we see a lot of opportunities to hire and attract people to the franchise and were actively doing that i would say its a bit of a gradual acceleration as the economy seems to be getting a little bit more front footed and we truly do believe we can reduce costs reallocate costs and so michael brown who is running our regional banking franchise for example is spending a lot of time looking at how we take opportunities to reduce costs in one area and investment in other areas and fund our own growth that way so we should see our pace of investment pick up id say thats true across regional banking id say thats true across our specialty businesses we see opportunities to improve there areas like our equipment finance and our asset base lending businesses where we need to be able to support the broader franchise for examples william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey steve id also add that the branch acquisition of the suntrust branch has also accelerated a lot of investment that we wanted to make which obviously helps our broader business particularly around mobile and digital banking and online banking and so we got that in we put in a new wire system that significantly upgraded things for our commercial customers were broadening and expanding our use of the ncino platform first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 thats going to streamline a lot of our commercial lending business end to end weve made some investments already and continue to do so in our treasury management and cash management so while theres a heavy heavy lift systems integration and just getting the two organizations knit together on the back end there are a lot of places where were strategically putting investment for the long term and even with that continue to take net cost out of the organization which we think is very positive d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee steve this is bryan again bj makes a really good point here and in that our integration timeline is more dictated by the investments that we want to make or closings or gaps in products and offering so if you looked at an allocation of the hours we have to get the integration completed i dont know probably or more of it is making investments and products rolling out a new online banking online platform things like that which we think will give the combined customer base a better experience and so were really looking at how we invest in the technology and infrastructure to make us a better organization steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful in terms of longterm targets i might be in the minority but i do miss the bonefish slide with that said following up on bradys question if you put all the pieces of the new company together right if we just ignore whats going to happen with provision because who knows over the next few quarters what do you see as a long term target for return on tangible common equity over time william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah thank you for bringing up the bonefish i still like it d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee ellen is not writing this down by the way william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah yeah yeah steve weve said for a long time over time that a midteens return on tangible common equity should be achievable for us and ironically were above that right now and could be depending on provisions for the next few quarters but a mid teens area over the medium term seems like the right place for us given our diversified business model our efficiency opportunity and our conservative credit profile that allows us to run capital at this range and optimize our use of the balance sheet that way so i still think that midteens is one what we can deliver steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats very helpful if i could ask one last question the followup on bryans comment on ma right i know the iberia deal just closed so the last thing on your mind is another deal with that said i just wanted to think big picture for a minute bryan before the iberia deal you always talked about regional banks needing to be sort of billion of assets or larger to be competitive you ended the year at billion at this size do you now first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 have the franchise you need to be competitive longterm or from this new vantage point do you think you need to be even larger to be competitive thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah thanks steve look i think in a phrase is yes i think so i think it would be hard to argue that you can win a scale game that the industrial logic behind the moe or bbt and suntrust and now truist is scale and they were both billionplus organization so theres some arguments for greater scale but when i look at the combined organization that we have i think weve got the capabilities in the product offerings and the ability to invest in infrastructure and products and services that we can be very very competitive and that we can be very differentiated in the way that service shows up to our customers and our communities he can always look for or make arguments for why more scale would help but at the end of the day you have to be able to operate the franchise as a differentiated entity and not as a just a bigger commodity in the marketplace and so we think this gives us a scale to invest we think it allows us to continue to operate a model that puts decision making very close to the customers it puts it in the places that people know their markets they know their customers and know who to do business with and who not to do business with and all of that i think it that does make us a differentiated entity that can outperform our peers in providing services and delivering returns steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc terrific thanks for all the color d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee youre welcome thank you operator our next question will come from chris marinac with janney please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks bryan as you make the fall systems converge in these next couple of quarters are you working towards a the old core of first horizon with a bunch of digital apis to run this platform or do you envision creating your own new core kind of using the bestinclass technology d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah chris as were moving forward were moving essentially to when it relates to the big loan and deposit systems to the core of first horizon bj mentioned one as an example where were going to leverage the technology that iberiabank was using with ncino and in some cases were putting in place completely upgraded systems like a wire system our online banking systems will be updated so but broadly speaking were not blazing any trials as it relates to new generation cores were working on improvement and operating technology that one or both organizations has in place and or where we can upgrade as you said would use an api as the front end capabilities first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great so it really is different than you would have done a merger five years ago from the systems standpoint d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think its not a whole lot dissimilar than what you would do you go from one set of you go from two sets of systems and we went through a thoughtful analysis i think our team did a really good job of looking what iberia was using and what first horizon was using and we chose the best of both organizations in terms of our ability to meet customer needs and deliver products and services and thats where were headed christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it great thanks very much for all the information this morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon
