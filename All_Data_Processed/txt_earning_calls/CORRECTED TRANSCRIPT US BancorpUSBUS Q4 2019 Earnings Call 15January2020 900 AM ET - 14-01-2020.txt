vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends average loans grew on a linked quarter basis and increased yearoveryear linked quarter growth was driven by strength in residential mortgages commercial real estate and credit card loans in ci paydown activity muted overall growth in the fourth quarter primarily reflected in the rate environment and robust capital market conditions new commercial business activity is healthy however paydown activity is likely to continue to be a headwind nearterm albeit a diminishing headwind assuming that the interest rate environment is stable turning to slide deposits increased on a linked quarter basis and grew yearoveryear notably average savings deposits grew by driven by acrosstheboard growth in wealth management investment services consumer banking and commercial banking turning to slide credit quality was stable in the fourth quarter on a dollar basis nonperforming assets declined approximately on both a linked quarter and a yearoveryear basis the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans plus other real estate owned also improved linked quarter and yearoveryear us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 the new accounting standard related to credit losses commonly known as cecl became effective january and has no impact on our results we estimate that the adoption of cecl will result in a billion cumulative effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses compared with december which is in line with our previous guidance slide highlights fourth quarter earnings results we reported earnings per share of which included several notable items which reduced earnings by per share excluding these notable items we reported earnings of per share slide lists the notable items that affected earnings results for the fourth quarter of and fourth quarter notable items included restructuring charges including severance and certain asset impairments and an increased derivative liability related to visa shares previously sold by the company as a reminder we recognized several notable items during the fourth quarter of including a gain on the sale of our atm servicing business and the sale of a majority of the companys covered loans as well as charges related to severance asset impairments and an accrual for certain legal matters along with a favorable impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to changes in estimates from tax reform the net impact of notable items in was an increase of per share my remarks through the remainder of the call will be referencing results excluding notable items incurred in the fourth quarters of and turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis declined by yearoveryear in line with our expectations as the impact of loan growth and higher yields on reinvestment of securities was more than offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and deposit funding mix our net interest margin declined by basis points versus the third quarter about basis points of the decline was due to higher premium amortization expense in the investment securities portfolio the remainder of the pressure can be attributed to the yield curve compression and earning asset mix partly offset by lower deposit costs we expect the net interest margin to be stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter slide highlights trends in noninterest income on a yearoveryear basis we saw good growth in merchants acquiring revenue driven by account and volume improvement as expected credit and debit card revenue declined yearoveryear due to two fewer days in the fourth quarter of we look for credit and debit card revenue to return to a midsingledigit growth pace in corporate payment products revenue declined driven by lower commercial business sales volumes however in the past few weeks sales volume growth has turned to a midsingledigit growth rate trust and investment management growth reflected business growth and favorable market conditions deposit service targets were impacted by the sale of the companys atm servicing business in the fourth quarter of the decline in treasury management fees from a year ago reflected the impact of changes in earnings credits a residual effect of the rising rate environment in notably treasury management fees increased on a linked quarter basis reflective of the recent interest rate declines in the third and fourth quarters of mortgage banking revenue increased yearoveryear on strong origination and sales revenue growth compared with the fourth quarter of mortgage production volume increased by and mortgage application volume increased by refinancing activity represented approximately audio gap in the fourth quarter of compared to about in the linked quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 refinancings represented of applications in the fourth quarter as of november our digital mortgage app was being utilized by about of all mortgage applications turning to slide the yearoveryear increase in noninterest expense reflected increased personnel expense higher technology and communication expense and higher net occupancy and equipment expense reflecting actions to support business growth slide highlights our capital position at december our common equity tier capital ratio estimated using the basel iii standardized approach was i will now provide some forwardlooking guidance for the first quarter of we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline at a lowsingledigit pace yearoveryear but to be relatively flat linked quarter normalized for day count we expect midsingledigit growth in fee revenue yearoveryear we expect lowsingledigit growth in noninterest expenses on a yearoveryear basis credit quality in the first quarter is expected to remain stable compared to the fourth quarter and we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately on a full year basis ill hand it back to andy for closing comments andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry we are operating in a dynamic environment and this quarters results reflected the challenging interest rate environment facing the entire industry as well as the impact of actions we took to better position our company for the future however as our core financial metrics indicate we ended the year on a solid note and we are in a strong position as we head into we view the interest rate environment as a manageable headwind and we are confident in our ability to prudently grow our balance sheet and gain market share in our fee businesses fee growth was negatively impacted by several headwinds in as terry discussed we expect a return to normalized growth in credit and debit card revenue this year in a more stable interest rate environment as the refidriven market shifts to a purchasedriven market the investments we made in our mortgage business over the past several years will become increasingly evident in the form of market share gains we are proud of our strong and consistent financial track record but we are always looking for ways to improve that means we are changing the way we think the way we work and the way we do business as we move into and beyond we will continue to increase workflow agility and speed to market for our products and services while at the same time optimizing our core operation to fund investment for the future our ability to leverage the ph combined dollar of our rapidly improving digital capabilities and our complete payment ecosystem will lead to higher customer satisfaction stronger revenue growth and efficiencies and ultimately improved returns in summary we remain focused on managing this company for the long term while delivering audio gap a pathway to the future id like to thank our employees for all we accomplished this year supported by their hard work and commitment to creating value for all our customers we will now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore go ahead please your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc just want to talk a little bit about the operating leverage expectation i mean we got your comments around the quarter but for full year i know you had previously indicated that it could be a challenge to attain positive operating leverage for the full year given the rate backdrop et cetera i wanted to get your updated thoughts on that if you see that there is a chance you could see positive operating leverage and what type of magnitude could you see terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah john thanks and as a reminder we had a goal of achieving positive operating leverage in and we did that on a core basis for the full year when we think about our objective is to target positive operating leverage and we expect our expense growth to continue to remain in those lowsingle digits so i think we have a number of levers that we continue to look at and pull in terms of optimization continue with our physical assets optimization of the branch system our back office activities and a number of different things so thats our goal thats our objective at this particular point in time now that said as you said in your question is a more difficult year simply because of the revenue outlook and i think part of being able to achieve it is going to be really based upon what happens with respect to interest rates et cetera so thats kind of how were thinking about it john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great thanks and then in terms of some of the headwinds that had impacted your fee progression i know there was the accounting change that impacted as well as a couple other items can you just talk about where do you expect underlying momentum to build in the fee businesses as you look at us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so when we end up looking at fee income i think theres a number of different things that we end up looking at i think the credit card revenue is stronger again midsingle digits as we think about next year and that particular line item was impacted by both an accounting item in as well as a pretty slow first quarter which we had talked about i think merchant acquiring continues to accelerate and get strong and we expect midsingle digits there and then the cps revenue while we saw a decline in the fourth quarter because of a little slower commercial spending that has come back in the first several weeks of the year and so our expectation in that category is kind of mid single digits as well deposit service charges has been a drag this year because of the sale of the atm business in so that kind of normalized or is at least flat in i think treasury management revenue is another area that we would expect its kind of hit an inflection point so while its down on a yearoveryear basis it is up on a linked quarter basis and we would expect that to be better than ph so i think theres a number of different things i think the offset to that is and if you think about mortgage and we talked about mortgage mortgage has been particularly strong in the last couple of quarters but in it was also quite a bit of a drag in the first several quarters so again depending upon what happens with interest rates but in the current environment i think that that continues to be a positive story i mean i think theres a number of different areas john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay terry thats helpful thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from bank of america go ahead please your line is open erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yes good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey erika terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hi erika andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp howre you doing this morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good thank you i heard you loud and clear on your expense growth and im wondering though if that the increased severance charges that weve seen could lead to a different geography in terms of expense growth and i guess im just looking back at your head count which seems to have risen sort of along coincident with the consent order and im wondering if part of the initial statement upfront andy in terms of continuing to transform the business is trying to take some of the compensation growth that you experienced over the last three years and really putting that back in technology is that sort of how we should expect the geography could change underneath that low singledigit expense growth that youre expecting for andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think thats not an unfair description erika its not just technology but its people and technology but its optimizing the way were doing business to continue to invest in the future and our expense growth was higher during the consent order period but as you know its been in the lowsingle digits the last couple of years and a notable really two notable items yearoveryear in and that includes optimization and expense takeout while at the same time investing in technology and people for the future and i would expect that to continue into erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc and i guess im wondering if our takeaway from that is because that seems like its behind you and again it feels like the severance charges are setting up for further optimization and rationalization that when youre accelerating the amount of dollars that youre putting into the future so to speak whether its head countrelated to that or technology itself terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i mean i think that thats a fair comment erika and again i think the shift is optimizing what i would call the back office and the branch network which are being impacted by customer behaviors as we transition to more of a digital environment but at the same time were reinvesting that in technology spend to support those in that digital transformation and so maybe a little bit of a shift from compensation to technology type of costs but our expectation when we think about is to continue to make the investments in the business that we have been making over the last couple of years erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc thank you and just one more if i could squeeze it in deposit costs were down basis points quarterover quarter and im wondering underneath the nii outlook will you expect for a deposit cost trend for the first quarter and also if the curve outlook continues to be stable from here could net interest margin for the rest of the year stabilize or potentially increase from levels terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 yeah well certainly if the rate environment continues where it is today our expectation is that net interest margin would be pretty flat to the fourth quarter with some possible positive bias depending upon what happens on the long end of the curve but thats kind of our thought process and the reason for that is the premium amortization that weve experienced in the third and fourth quarter is stabilizing at this particular point in time when we think about deposit cost deposit price we have been pretty responsive on the institutional deposits in terms of bringing those repricing those down as rates have come down and i think from here on out deposit pricing will be a function of both competition and what happens on the short end of the curve erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler go ahead please your line is open terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning scott andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hi thanks for taking the question just curious if you might be able to offer any just top level comments on the overall kind of pace of loan growth and overall demand if you look at the ha data its definitely been held up or supported by the consumer side but its been a little surprising to see the slowdown in growth on the commercial side however so im just curious given the breadth of your guys franchise and different types of customers you look at what youre seeing at a very top level terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well at a very high level again i think economically we feel pretty optimistic in terms of what the outlook there is if you end up looking at the components of loan growth i think we saw a pretty strong and good growth with respect to consumer lending the area that was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter was really our ci or our corporate sort of lending and thats principally while we saw production and the pipeline continuing to be reasonably strong we saw pretty significant paydowns that were taking place in that space driven by capital markets activities and thats a function of the long end of the curve coming down in the third and probably fourth quarter with that stabilizing while we would expect some of the paydowns to continue into the first quarter i think that will moderate us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then just any additional updates on ramification from the lcr rules i think you guys have been talking about billion to billion of liquidity freeup any updated thoughts on how youre thinking about that dynamic terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah thats in the ballpark in terms of the amount of what the impact is with respect to lcr were continuing to look at different alternatives and part of it is thinking about extending duration a little bit possibly investing a little bit more in agency mortgagebacked securities which would provide a little bit better yield but i think it will be on the margin and it wont be anything dramatic r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right thats perfect thank you very much operator and there are no further questions in queue at this time id like to turn the call back over to jennifer thompson for closing remarks oh it looks like we did get one question we do have a question from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan chase go ahead please your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you hi andy hi terry just wanted to clarify on creditdebit card fees what was the impact from two fewer processing days what does that do and is there a reversal in terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah good question there was an impact of two days that ended up really taking our fee income from kind of that low to middlesingle digits to the negative in the fourth quarter there is one extra day in relative to but let me just kind of dissect it a little bit because i think that that is maybe helpful when you end up looking at the growth rate for it was really impacted by three different things one is that there was an accounting change that occurred in the first quarter of that because of the lapping effect ended up depressing growth rates in in addition if you remember the consumer spend level in the first quarter was significantly lower and its kind of at an unusually low level and of course as concerns around the economy stabilize that consumer spends come up that has been in the midsingle digits in the second third and kind of fourth quarter in terms of sales volumes and then as you know getting back to the processing days quarterly results can be lumpy but when we think about in terms of on a full year basis we really think that midsingle digits is a good target for us and a good estimate for us our sales volumes over the last several quarters have been kind of in that range and when you think about it on a day adjusted basis its been pretty consistent from quartertoquarter so in theres one more day and that will help a little bit but midsingle digits for i think is a good estimate again quarterly results will be a little bit lumpy but when we think about the year thats kind of how were thinking about it us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and when i look back over the prior couple of years youd had this line item was growing at sort of more like to when you look at to has there been going to the midsingle digits has there been any reduction in pricing a shift in the kind of contracts or is this higher rewards expense what terry is driving that slowdown from that highsingledigit level to the midsingledigit run rate terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah the growth rates in were influenced in some respect because of some portfolios that we were acquiring during that particular timeframe more so than other factors and so when we think about pricing there hasnt been a lot of compression with respect to price and we feel pretty good about that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and rewards have been relatively flat actually that has been a factor so that midsingledigit number is a good way to think about the next months vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and as you think about in terms of other fee revenues andy you said and terry treasury management should be good corporate card fees when i look at that that was also a little bit softer this quarter its actually down yearonyear any color on that because i know that the yeah andy and ill just let you answer that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes vivek the impact of that is because we saw in the last half of the fourth quarter corporate spend activity slow that had been running in the mid singledigits a little bit higher in the first few quarters fourth quarter saw a slowdown to almost flat and as terry mentioned in his prepared remarks we did see a pickup in the first two weeks of january back to the midsingle digits so that was ph attributable less slowdown but it seems to have come back terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp and i think that one of the reasons for that is if you think about where the yield curve about how rates were moving there was concerns about recession people were uncertain with respect to economic data and then you had the hangover of tariffs i think the sentiment on a corporate side appears to be looking better were going to be signing a trade agreement with china today i believe in terms of phase i and the us mexico canada agreement is well on its way so i think that some of that uncertainty that might have been impacting discretionary spend in the commercial side of the equation has been alleviated so we feel pretty good vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and i want to confirm one last thing cecl day could you talk a little bit of what do you see that doing to your provision expense andy terry us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah weve talked about certainly day one and day two as part of investor day the provision will increase we think that in terms of loan growth providing basically at kind of that level versus is kind of how were thinking about it but theres going to be more volatility related to cecl and i think one of the things well end up looking at is just what is the stability in the overall portfolio and what our net chargeoffs doing on a quarterto quarter basis vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks vivek operator and we do have other question from the line of ken usdin with jefferies go ahead please your line is open amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc hi everyone this is amanda larsen on for ken terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah amanda how are you doing amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc great thanks i think its understood that will likely be an aberration versus the longterm trend that you set out at investor day related to revenue growth headwind but that youll still strive to achieve positive operating leverage in but im wondering how negative could negative operating leverage be in before you do take actions related to slowing the pace of investment spend or creating more sales andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so as terry mentioned again and earlier we expect and target positive operating leverage for we have a number of levers that we can continue to pull to optimize the current organization structure to continue to invest in the future so amanda the way we think about it is a balance of optimizing today and investing in the future while always targeting net positive operating leverage and thats how were managing the company amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then can you guys talk about the capability adds of sage pay and how you see your banks position evolving in the ecommerce payments arena over the medium term thanks us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah were very excited about sage pay it is a kind of leader in the ecommerce space within the uk and ireland and we also have the opportunity to be able to extend that into the rest of europe we have a pretty big footprint across europe so pretty excited about that as we think about next year we ended up rolling out sort of similar ecommerce capabilities over the course of the last months to months here domestically and so we believe that that gives us more capabilities in terms of being able to take advantage of ecommerce in the future amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc awesome thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks amanda terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous go ahead please your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey guys sorry i jumped on a little bit late did you give an update on the charlotte expansion andy and how thats going and whether youre kind of targeting new areas for this year to expand on the retail side andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john charlottes going well we opened the branch about three months ago weve had new customer acquisition growth in current customers employees are fired up we are targeting a number of new branches to be opening yeah this year and still targeting that number of were learning a lot from that investment we continue to track that and measure our activity and i would expect us to continue to expand in new markets but our first focus is expanding to our target number in charlotte john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got you okay and then terry just a couple of cleanup things on nii i think you mentioned the amortization kind of stabilizes early this year is that right and then the rolloff rates like where the tenure is today are those kind of breakeven or slightly accretable where youre putting new money to work in the bond portfolio today relative to whats rolling off terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 15jan2020 yes so addressing kind of your second question first the reinvestment with respect to securities is still about basis points or so accretive so and we would expect that based upon where rates are today the premium amortization does stabilize in the first quarter and so when we think about net interest margin for the year we think its going to be relatively flat maybe a little bit of positive bias relative to the fourth quarter of john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay so the down nii for the year is just the tough comps of where you started last year i guess ride things from a sequential standpoint though it feels relatively stable terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yes john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john operator and with that there are no further questions in queue id like to turn the call back over to jennifer thompson for closing remarks jennifer ann thompson executive vice president directorinvestor relations us bancorp thank you everyone for listening to our earnings
