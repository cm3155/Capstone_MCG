president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jennifer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call synovus reported a loss of in the second quarter of which included a previously announced million loss from the recent securities repositioning that was executed as a result of the capital benefits derived from our riskweighted asset optimization exercise however adjusted earnings per share were compared to in the first quarter while adjusted pre provision net revenue rose from the prior quarter to million adjusted revenue and earnings inflected higher in the second quarter net interest income increased from the prior quarter on basis points of sequential nim expansion also adjusted noninterest revenue jumped sequentially while adjusted noninterest expense declined moreover our net chargeoffs and nonperforming loans declined meaningfully this quarter and our liquidity and capital positions remain as strong as theyve been in several years our success and positive momentum are a direct result of the work of our talented team members we are also making progress in key initiatives and in further strengthening our value proposition for our clients we continue to attract talent in the expansion of our commercial and wealth lines of business our retail analytics platform has translated into a better client experience and is delivering increase in new revenue resulting from the insights and leads generated our focus on the business owner wealth strategy is delivering a conversion rate on qualified referrals our growth in the current pipelines remain robust in treasury and payment solutions our efforts to reduce fraud and operating losses have proven fruitful with yeartodate expenses down synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 and lastly we saw a significant improvement in credit costs this quarter in fact our community bank line of business ended the quarter and yeartodate in a net recovery position so our progress is broadbased and truly a team effort in addition as weve discussed in recent quarters our focus remains firmly on execution while reducing uncertainty in performance associated with the net interest margin and credit cost the second quarter results reflect our progress towards these goals now lets turn to slide for the highlights as previously noted net interest income increased from the first quarter as a result of basis points of sequential net interest margin expansion despite funded production increasing almost million this quarter periodend loans were down just over million from the first quarter we continue to generate healthy and consistent loan growth in the middle market cib and specialty commercial units but payoff activity in senior housing and national accounts as well as lower ci utilization drove the overall decline in outstandings for the quarter core deposits declined slightly in the second quarter driven by a drop in noninterestbearing deposits offset by growth in time deposits furthermore we reduced brokered deposits for the fourth consecutive quarter our team remains highly focused on accelerating core funding generation through sales activities and product expansion adjusted noninterest revenue increased from the prior quarter primarily from significant growth in capital markets income on a yearoveryear basis there was strong growth in commercial sponsorship income from the expansion of card sponsorship business as well as our partnership with greensky capital markets and treasury and payment solutions fees also contributed to healthy yearoveryear growth adjusted noninterest expense was down sequentially and relatively flat on a yearoveryear basis our cost initiatives as well as ongoing diligence have led to a modest core operating expense growth from a year ago while maintaining a level of strategic investments that positions synovus well from a competitive standpoint in order to drive longterm shareholder value on the asset quality front net chargeoffs of basis points were basis points lower than the first quarter levels while nonperforming loans declined by basis points lastly we further bolstered our common equity tier ratio in the second quarter through solid earnings accretion and balance sheet management while still completing about million of opportunistic share repurchases common equity tier levels are the highest in over eight years at and currently sit modestly above our stated range of to now ill turn it over to jamie to cover the second quarter results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin moving to slide periodend loans were down million from the prior quarter loan production actually rose significantly from the first quarter but was offset by payoffs paydowns and continued portfolio rationalization as well as lower utilization from our larger corporate and specialty line clients we continue to maintain pricing discipline as evidenced by loan spreads on new production which remain elevated relative to the prior year consistent with our focus on core client relationships despite utilization headwinds growth in middle market commercial cib and specialty lines was million or annualized during the second quarter during the first synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 half of we produced annualized growth in these core commercial business lines which we believe should continue throughout the remainder of the year senior housing loans declined million from the prior quarter there has been increased strength in the markets as evidenced by higher levels of transaction and refinancing activity over the last few quarters that said we anticipate more stable senior housing balances throughout the remainder of we also continue to strategically reduce our nonrelationship lending within our national accounts portfolio as well as our thirdparty consumer loans further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth these balances were down million in the second quarter in the second half of this year thirdparty consumer loans should continue to decline an estimated million per quarter while national account balances should be more stable we estimate we should see stable to higher total loans in the second half of with continued growth in our key commercial segments turning to slide periodend core deposit balances were relatively flat on a linked quarter basis with somewhat more stable mix shifts within the quarter noninterestbearing deposit balances were down million from the prior quarter however average balances were more stable in the second quarter relative to the first quarter we still see some further pressure on noninterestbearing deposits though the trends continue to suggest notable slowing in the pace of decline in those balances finally brokered deposits declined million or from the first quarter which is the fourth consecutive quarter of contraction deposit costs were stable in the second quarter up just basis point from the prior quarter this equates to a cycletodate total deposit cost beta of approximately which was unchanged compared to the first quarter as we look at the back half of the year we expect deposit costs to remain relatively stable and are looking for broadbased deposit growth across our business segments which should be supported by seasonal tailwinds into the end of the year moving to slide net interest income was million in the second quarter which was an increase of from the first quarter the second quarter benefited from various drivers including improving loan yields the residual impact of first quarter hedge maturities and the securities repositioning in may as we alluded to in the first quarter we also witnessed relative stabilization in deposit cost and mix trends which resulted in a much more modest headwind to interest expense as we translate that to the margin nim expanded basis points sequentially to this was primarily driven by the same factors which supported net interest income along with a onetime positive impact from our securities held to maturity reclassification which served to reduce earning assets as we look forward to the third and fourth quarters of we continue to expect net interest margin expansion driven by fixed rate asset repricing and fourth quarter hedge maturities as well as a full quarter impact of the securities repositioning which was completed in may kevin will provide further detail on our guidance momentarily which is based on an fomc rate cut of basis points in december slide shows total reported noninterest revenue was impacted by the million of securities loss related to our securities repositioning in the second quarter however adjusted noninterest revenue was million which is a jump from the previous quarter adjusted noninterest revenue was up million or yearoveryear the majority of the sequential growth was attributable to higher capital markets fees which surged from the first quarter and are expected to remain elevated in the second half of the year the growth was driven by syndication finance arranger fees and that capital markets income synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 also commercial analysis treasury and payment solutions fees increased while core wealth management income increased outside of an expected decline in repo income due to client asset allocation changes when looking at the yearago quarter core banking fees increased supported by growth in treasury and payment solutions while capital markets fees increased and commercial sponsorship income jumped we continue to invest in core noninterest revenue streams that deepen client relationships and provide further healthy fee growth in areas such as treasury and payment solutions capital markets and wealth management moving to expense slide highlights our operating cost discipline reported and adjusted noninterest expense were both million adjusted noninterest expense declined from the first quarter and was flat compared to the yearago quarter employment expense fell from the first quarter largely due to seasonality partially offset by a full quarter impact of the merit increases and higher employee incentives turning to other expenses fdic premiums declined as a result of the million fdic special assessment that was accrued in the first quarter and a partial special assessment reversal of million in the second quarter legal expenses increased from the prior quarter primarily due to expenses associated with previously resolved problem loans employment expense declined yearoveryear benefited by our yearoveryear decline in head count occupancy and equipment expense increased as a result of ongoing technology investments as well as increased property expense importantly we will remain proactive with disciplined expense management in this growthconstrained environment moving to slides and on credit quality provision for credit losses declined from the first quarter to million our allowance for credit losses ended the second quarter at million or which is relatively unchanged from the first quarter net chargeoffs in the second quarter were million or basis points compared to basis points in the first quarter and basis points in the fourth quarter nonperforming loans declined and are now of loans down from in the first quarter primarily from the resolution of a previously charged off credit and slower inflows the criticized and classified credit ratio declined slightly to and remains at very manageable levels we have a high degree of confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio and we will continue to reduce our nonrelationship credits and manage the portfolio with a heightened level of diligence in this more uncertain macroeconomic environment as seen on slide our capital position continued to build in the second quarter with the preliminary common equity tier ratio reaching and total riskbased capital now at a strong quarter of core earnings coupled with the completion of our previously announced riskweighted asset optimization exercise helped to support over basis points of capital accretion within the quarter against that we completed the anticipated available for sale securities repositioning and we executed approximately million in share repurchases these actions served to diligently deploy our capital while still ending the quarter near the topend of our targeted cet1 range more details on the securities repositioning can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck as we look to the remainder of the year we will maintain a disciplined approach to capital management which balances the uncertain economic environment with prudently managing near the topend of our to cet1 range as a reminder our focus remains on prioritizing the deployment of our balance sheet and capital position for core client growth however we expect to complement that with share repurchases to effectively manage within our capital management framework ill now turn it back to kevin to discuss our guidance synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie ill continue with our updated guidance for the remainder of based on the first half results and our existing pipelines periodend loan growth is expected to be to in growth should be supported by continued success in middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lines year todate headwinds with senior housing and national account syndicated lending are expected to subside but broader commercial real estate payoff activity should increase in the second half of the year our forecast for core deposits now supports growth within the to range aided by seasonal tailwinds as the year progresses and new core funding growth initiatives stable deposit costs should result in a peak total deposit cost beta for this cycle near current levels of approximately our outlook now points to adjusted revenue growth in the negative to range importantly our adjusted revenue guidance now assumes there is one basis point rate cut in december compared to our prior assumption of stable rates as well as the realization of our robust capital markets pipeline in the second half of we expect more net interest income improvement in the second half of this year as deposit cost stability combined with fixed rate asset repricing our hedge maturities and the full impact of the securities repositioning benefit our net interest margin adjusted noninterest revenue is now forecasted to grow in the mid singledigit percentage range this year versus our previous guidance of low to mid singledigit growth the previously mentioned capital markets fee pipeline remains strong we continue to execute on core growth in treasury and payment solutions and the greensky forward flow program continues to build commercial sponsorship fees we remain very focused on disciplined expense control excluding the fdic special assessments we anticipate our adjusted noninterest expense will be up to this year this modest increase in expense guidance is due to incremental expenses in infrastructure spend and investments legal costs primarily associated with resolved credits and higher team member incentives we continue to closely monitor and manage our loan portfolio for any credit deterioration or systemic themes across industry and markets given current credit migration trends assuming a relatively stable economic environment and considering the impact of certain large individual losses in late and early we expect net chargeoffs to be flat to down in the second half of this year compared to basis points in the first half of moving to the tax rate our current forecast points to an approximately level as compared to to previously finally our common equity tier ratio is above our targeted range of to therefore we will remain opportunistic with share repurchases to manage overall capital levels at or near the topend of this range prudent capital management remains our top priority to ensure we have a strong and liquid balance sheet which is prioritized toward serving the growth needs of our clients regardless of the economic environment and now operator this concludes our prepared remarks lets open the call for questions synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you very much we will now begin the questionandanswer section operator instructions the first question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc maybe i guess just around the comments on net interest margin expansion in the back half if you could unpack that in terms of the drivers of margin expansion obviously the full quarter impact of the bond book restructuring should help but beyond that just remind us in terms of the back book repricing and how nii evolves in the face of potential for rate cuts starting in september maybe if you could start there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks ebrahim when you look at the margin and the trajectory in the second half of the year there are a few different moving parts first as you mentioned the securities repositioning we experienced about half of that benefit in the second quarter and well experience another the other half here in the third quarter and so thats a tailwind to the margin this quarter there is as you know a little bit of fixed rate asset repricing as well in the third quarter thats a positive but then theres a headwind due to average dda balances you can see that in the appendix we put average balances and endofperiod balances and there will be a decline in average balances just given the second quarter where that landed and so thatll be a headwind to the margin in the third quarter but we expect margin expansion in the third quarter we expect margin expansion again in the fourth quarter and we expect to end the year at or approaching a margin given a with the assumption of a rate cut in december ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just incrementally if we get a series of rate cuts jamie is that a drag to the nim at least short term synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp it does it does so for our guidance we used the fed dot plot from june but if you were to pivot to a september rate cut which is more consistent with the forward curve today there would be pressure on the margin in the month of september and october and so let me just kind of unpack that a little bit because this is an important question as we head into an easing cycle in the period of time leading up to the ease there is nim pressure which is minor due to short rates declining in the expectation of an ease and so asset yields will decline and theres really not an offsetting benefit to funding cost then once the ease happens the margin will be pressured further as the majority of floating rate loans reprice down now the full impact of the ease will flow through on the loans almost immediately as the majority of our floating rate loans are one month rates or shorter but that will be partially mitigated by the of floating rate loans that are hedged and then when youre post easing then you will start to see the benefit of reduced liability cost and so you have the asset repricing but then the reduced deposit cost reduced funding cost will come through and we believe that that will neutralize the reduction in asset yields over the course of one to two months and so kind of to be more specific around that if you were to just compare a september and december ease the forward curve relative to the fed dot plot which is a december ease theres about million to million margin i mean a nii impact between those two scenarios and its split between the second and the third quarter i mean the third and the fourth quarter because its a september and october impact ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats extremely helpful and just the only other followup jamie you mentioned stable deposit costs second half one if you dont mind give us an update on the pricing sort of competition in your markets we had a peer of yours talk about intensity picking up so would love any color there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp the deposit pricing is playing out like we said in april as we look at the outlook from here we expect stable deposit cost through the remainder of the year we feel good about our positioning here we feel good about our production pipelines pricing what weve seen in the marketplace is not necessarily an increase in competition but weve seen more coalescing around rates and less volatility between highs and lows and it feels to us like on the promotional rate that theres a concentration around if you look at cds the concentration around and youre not seeing a lot of the outliers that we were seeing earlier in the year that were much higher and it appears that the banking industry it appears everybody is preparing for an easing cycle by shortening the duration which is appropriate and thats youve seen that with us as well where we have twothirds of our cds that will mature in six months and so i feel like the industry is preparing for easing the industry is shortening the duration of time deposits and kind of coalescing around market rates so it feels competitive but stable to us kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 and ebrahim just to put a data point behind jamies comments our production rates for the quarter were and we achieved kind of peak rates back in the fourth quarter of at so weve seen stable production yields quarteronquarter and actually a reduction versus where we ended last year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc extremely helpful thank you for taking my questions operator thank you our next question is from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven your line is now open please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning steven andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the loan growth headwinds maybe could you help us better understand whats left in terms of the remaining headwind from rationalization efforts and then kevin i thought you said that the cre payoffs would increase in the back half of the year maybe you could quantify that for us and how far away do you think we are to where these cumulative headwinds are really behind the company and that strategic growth and other areas of growth were seeing start becoming the total loan growth kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah steven its a great question because i think there to your point when you assess the growth of loan outstandings theres multiple components and weve talked a lot about our ability to grow predicated on increasing production but as you mentioned theres a couple of things that are driving outstandings lower in the current environment first and foremost weve been rationalizing some of our portfolios that either we think have lower returns or have a lower funding profile and that specifically is senior housing thirdparty consumer our andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp national accounts kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 national accounts thank you and when you look at those portfolios and weve run off about billion in the last months in those portfolios thats reduced their total percentage of outstandings from to and thats largely been accomplished and so as we look forward for senior housing national accounts those balances will stay roughly flat and when you look at thirdparty consumer those are going to continue to decline just because were not putting on a lot of new production so i would say that the headwinds around rationalization and any loan sales which as you recall we did the mob sale the medical office sale last year thats largely done so as you look into the future our production levels are actually increasing when you look at this quarter alone we were at billion in funded production that was up quarteronquarter and almost back to the levels we saw back in so production is picking up our pipelines are up quarteronquarter so then the other question mark is the payoff and paydown activity this quarter as jamie referenced the payoff activity occurred more on the ci side it was the national accounts and senior housing and we saw about million of lower utilization on ci from a cre perspective we dont expect the payoffs to really pick up this quarter but rather in the fourth quarter and thats just based on some of the maturities that we have and to put it in context we had about million of payoff and paydown activity this quarter that number could get as high as million to million so were talking about millionish increase in payoff activity and those are the headwinds now again thats predicated on some of the renewals as we look into as weve shared in the past we think a lot of those headwinds are completely abated and we return to more of a normalized growth rate pending what the underlying economic environment looks like steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats terrific color maybe just for my followup question thank you for that in terms of the noninterest bearing deposits right there was a bit of excitement last quarter when you guys talked about seeing a trough maybe and stability in february march april and then this quarter the periodend noninterestbearing came down quite a bit again could you walk us through what you ended up seeing there because it seems like they trended a bit down kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah its we had a good start to the quarter and we saw some declines as the quarter progressed and it was really relegated to our commercial operating accounts and when you look at the average balance there were still running about higher than what the average balances were prior to the pandemic so it still suggests that theres some sort of excess cash sitting on our commercial client balance sheets and theyre using it as maybe correlated to the reduction in utilization we continue to see our commercial clients use cash as rates decline as we achieve kind of prepandemic levels which were getting closer to that we think that diminishment will continue to decline and ultimately the production and some augmentation that were starting to see will offset that so still expect to see some dda remixing in the second half of the year but the pace at which its diminishing continues to decline andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 and steven one thing i would add to that is when you break it down we have to kevins point on commercial weve seen stability in retail dda since the beginning of the year commercial like the smaller commercial clients that is down but its only down slightly and so its i feel like the stability is increasing but its going upmarket as we go through those and so thats what were seeing and we one thing that helps us believe that itll diminish in the second half of the year as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it terrific thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question from jared shaw with barclays capital jared your line is now open please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good morning everybody kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc maybe just quickly just following up on the margin discussion and you mentioned that we have half the benefit of the securities repositioning what was the whats the spot yield on the securities book at the end of the quarter going into third quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp jared i dont have that handy i think we were at for the quarter itself its about a basis point impact just due to the repositioning but i dont have the spot yield at quarterend jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay thats fine and then looking at credit if you could give just a little more discussion around that its great seeing sort of the confidence there in the bigger trends when you look at the driver of the lower acl is that really loanlevel performance that youre feeling more comfortable with or was there some change to the broader macro model assumptions driving that and then should we assume that were sort of stable here at these levels given the broader economic outlook synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jared this is jamie again and by the way that was in june for the securities yield look the allowance when you look at that the change quarteronquarter it really was due to the macro drivers you can see the waterfall in the appendix of the change forwardlooking we feel good about the level where we are right now when you look at the components of the allowance quarteronquarter the performance in cre continues to be very strong and the allowance to loan ratio for the quarter lifeofloan loss estimate was down in cre and it was up a little bit in ci so you see a little bit of shifts within the portfolios but all together we would expect stability from here given the economic outlook as we continue to look at how the portfolio migrates going into the second half of the year kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and i think jared just to your broader question on credit i think it was a solid quarter on all fronts when you look at the data net chargeoffs down basis points npls declined basis points our fdms declined million but we only had million of npl inflows and to jamies point only million of that was in cre and when you talk about the acl yeah it came down a bit but our coverage to npls increased back to so allinall i think it was a storyline that was broadbased and as weve been talking about as we look at the data and the underlying credit metrics were not seeing any additional deterioration in many ways were starting to see some improvement in some of the metrics and so as we look into the next couple of quarters thats why we feel very comfortable about guiding flat to down in overall chargeoffs jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks very much for the color operator our next question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley manan your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i wanted to ask on the expenses front can you expand a little bit on the drivers of the higher expense guide and the number implies i think about million or so of expenses a quarter in the back half so how do you think about that as a jumping off point into andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks for the question manan i would just start and say the baseline for the second quarter i would use million which is adjusted expenses excluding the fdic reversal and we are expecting the third quarter to be in the million area so not the million you mentioned we expect that to be driven by increased personnel costs and thats largely a day count issue we do have some infrastructure project spend some of thats fraud detection fraud prevention pricing analytics and then theres just simply some other inflationary impacts and so its about a increase from the second quarter getting to the million area and we expect that to hold in the fourth quarter as well manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 got it and thats a good run rate for andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look at we do think that expense rate will be a little more normalized we will give an update on more at the end of the year but we do expect expenses to be more normalized in and so benefited from a lot of the efforts that we did in with synovus forward in the second half of the year in we had a lot of efficiency efforts that were very successful in reducing cost improving efficiency reducing head count and those benefited this year i mean when you think about the full year were talking about up if you do use the midpoint of the guide excluding fdic and there are some large drivers in there of expense increases we have about a impact of simply of merit about a impact of the consolidation of qualpay about a impact of credit related expenses from the first half of the year and with all of that and every other inflationary impact were still guiding to a to number that feels pretty good but we do expect to likely be higher than that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it i appreciate the color and then maybe separately on capital your target cet1 is to youre slightly above that i think youre saying you want to manage to the higher end what keeps you at the higher end of that to target is it the current uncertainty in the economy is it credit what would drive you to move to the lower end or even below that that number andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp in isolation we would drive to be there today just when you look at capital management stress testing scenario analysis theres nothing quantitative that would drive you to the levels where we are now or even to to you would actually likely run below that when we think about capital deterioration and severe adverse scenario but we believe its prudent to operate with higher capital than the models would suggest just given one there is uncertainty in the environment but again that would point you to the levels where we are today and two where peers are and so one thing weve seen over the past few years in economic uncertainty in market uncertainty we do believe that relative capital ratios to peers in uncertain times can lead to higher betas and we think its prudent to stay closer to peer levels and so while its not quantitative its not due to uncertainty in the income statement its not due to uncertainty in the balance sheet we do think its prudent to run at these higher levels in the current environment manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator thank you our next question is from brandon king with truist securities brandon your line is now open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brandon andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so good morning so capital markets was pretty strong in the quarter and jamie you mentioned how you expect it to stay elevated going forward i guess for the rest of the year so does that mean well still see i guess close to that million run rate back half of the year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we do expect to see that continue however i would just qualify it with it is uncertain how itll play out quarter to quarter so i feel more confident in the total number in the second half of the year than being able to say its a stable number quarter to quarter because with our client base with the uncertainty with the economy with the uncertainty with the election we do believe that its likely that there are deals thatll wait until the fourth quarter and so that could backendload the capital markets fee revenue so again we feel good about the total number just not certain how much will come through in q3 and how much will come through in q4 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and brandon to add to the reason we feel comfortable with that as jamie mentioned weve been investing in some of the capital market solutions for some time and if i look back several years i would say of our revenue in capital markets came from the derivative side if i look at this quarter as a standalone basis only of the revenue came from derivatives almost came from syndications and lead arranger fees we had almost a quarter of the revenue from dcm fees a little over in fx in sba so it is so broadbased that it gives us the opportunity that were not overreliant on one particular area and thats what gives us confidence that well be able to continue with this new kind of high water run rate brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and that was actually my followup question is if you thought this was kind of a base to grow off of in and beyond kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah i think and think about this when we start to see loan production pick up again the derivative income will pick up with it so i think theres not only a run rate here but theres a lot of growth that could come off this base brandon king q analyst truist securities inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 okay thats helpful and then lastly your expectations around deposit brokered deposit runoff you had a decline in the quarter just how are you expecting that to trend in the back half of this year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look at the back half of the year we would expect to see that stable to declining we saw some decent declines in the first half of the year but i think well look to see how loan growth progresses in the second half of the year to really see how brokered deposits will play out but we probably would say its stable to down brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question is from timur braziler with wells fargo timur your line is now open please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning timur andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess i was a little bit surprised that the revenue guide the topend of the revenue guide was maybe guided down a little bit following the strong nii quarter and the momentum youre seeing on the fee side i guess maybe just talk us through some of the dynamics that could still net us to the kind of lowend that negative or maybe you have greater confidence given some of the results and expectations for the second half of the year that revenue is going to be more or less flat for the year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look at the second half of the year the upside drivers to our guidance would be largely loan growth and so you think about we took off the top on loan growth and that helped lead to the reduction of the topend on revenue growth but when we look at the rest of the year highend of our revenue guide would be one it synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 could be a flat rate scenario which would be accretive two it would be continued strength in fee revenue that outpaces the mid singledigits that where weve given guidance which is a possibility three it would be increased loan growth as kevin mentioned that the assumptions in our guide include declines in cre and that is not something that weve seen yeartodate its not something that we expect to see necessarily in the third quarter and so that could be a tailwind as well and so i guess i would point to loan balances being one of the bigger drivers to the highend of the range in nii for the second half of the year if you think about the lower end of the range i would say it would be in fee revenue it could be deals getting pushed out and pushed into even though we dont expect that in fee revenue but it would also be if theres more aggressive easing than what we have in there which is the december ease but as i mentioned earlier we think that if you just add a september ease thats only a million to million impact to nii in the second half of the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and as a followup maybe can you just talk us through the strategy of reclassifying your available for sale bonds into held to maturity during the quarter especially it being longer duration bonds that were moved to htm kind of locking in that aoci can you just maybe talk through the rationale and that change at this point in the rate cycle andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah understood the rationale was first these are securities that were unlikely to ever be sold because theyre longer duration they were deeper underwater and so the marks were large enough that it was unlikely there would be a scenario where we would ever sell these securities second as we do not look at tangible common equity ratios as far as a risk management tool we use regulatory capital ratios we use nii volatility things like that that kind of get to what people use tangible common equity for the ratio the aoci impact of that but we have seen the press and the street use tangible common equity volatility and aoci frequently when theyre comparing banks and we thought it was prudent to take a little bit of that volatility off the table when we moved them to held to maturity there was approximately million in unrealized losses associated with that portion of the securities portfolio and moving that to held to maturity reduced tangible common equity volatility of a 100basispoint rate move down from basis points to around basis points and so we just think its prudent to reduce the volatility in that ratio same thing can be said for cet1 including aoci even though were not held to that standard and so that was the general thought that there was very little opportunity calls these were not securities that we were likely to ever trade and it would just reduce the volatility in tce as well as cet1 including aoci timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for that color operator our next question is from michael rose with raymond james michael your line is now open please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey thanks for taking my questions just a few quick andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp michael are you there jennifer demba a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp operator why dont you operator our next question is from sorry jennifer demba a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp i was going to say why dont you move on to the next caller and bring michael back into the queue operator yeah so our next question is from catherine mealor with kbw catherine your line is now open please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i just wanted to follow back up on the fee income discussion and could you just kind of help us just broadly not just capital markets but broadly think about maybe the run rate that youre expecting in fees in the back half of the year if were kind of if were trying to look around your mid singledigit growth range then it would imply that your kind of core fee run rate is going back to around the first quarter level which is a big pullback from what we saw this past quarter and so just trying to think about are you being conservative there or is there actually a case to be made that we could see closer to high singledigit growth here andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey catherine as we look at fee revenue growth with the midsingledigit range youre right is a little bit higher than in the first quarter but we expect the third quarter again the timing of the capital markets piece is the uncertainty but in the second half of the year we would expect to see similar fee revenue as what youve kind of seen at or close to what you saw in the second quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so that is a significant that does make the case that fee income growth will be much higher than your guidance which is great okay and then as you think about next year what kind of longerterm growth rate in fees would you expect just given some of the momentum youre seeing in capital markets kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 i mean i think it kind of gets back to what we were saying earlier were obviously not giving guidance but what weve been trying to build is a foundation around some of these core fee income revenue sources that will generate sustainable growth and to your point when you look at fee income this past quarter it was up yearoveryear and that was a function of many different areas not just capital markets although capital markets had a strong growth we were up in core fees about and thats largely a function of our treasury and payment solutions area weve been growing at about yearoveryear in annualized fee income weve also had growth in some our other fee categories like credit cards and other fee income remind you there was a big headwind going into this year in wealth management we had both repo revenue down and that was a product that we were selling to a large municipality that no longer was using that solution and that was providing just a million its a total of million headwind for the quarter and we divested of our money management firm globalt and that was about million so when you think about our results today you add in those headwinds along with a change in our underlying consumer account structure that minimizes insufficient funds which also has a headwind when you look out to youre not going to have those youre not going to have a headwind with nsf fees youre not going to have repo headwinds globalt will be fully off the books and therell be no comparability so when we continue to have the performance in core banking fees capital markets and we get some of the growth in wealth again i think you could see a growth rate that is even higher than this year depending on the underlying economic environment catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats super helpful and one more followup just the other line thats been about million the past couple of quarters is there anything kind of onetime that you see in that or do you think thats also a good run rate for the back half of the year kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp there were some onetime benefits from some oreo properties where we took some fee income from that so that was elevated a little bit this past quarter so i think other will come down a little bit and may be made up in some other categories catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for all the color kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question is from michael rose with raymond james michael your line is now open please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 okay can you guys hear me now andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right perfect catherine actually just asked my question but just maybe one on the i know its minor but you did have an inflection in criticized and classified can you just talk about broadly what thats composed of by category and if youre starting to see migration maybe more into citype credits where i think were seeing an increased number of bankruptcies versus some of the earlier migration in i assume office and i know you talked about transportation in the past things like that are you seeing a broadening or shifting of any sort of migration there thanks robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey michael its bob just a couple of comments on that but the inflection was really on our past due ratio we had a past due credit that settled and resolved and came off the list the first week of july so that cleared so thats the bulk of a spike in past dues in terms of criticized and classified we were relatively stable overall around so again thats a little bit of a moving target as you think about loans moving in and out of your watch list and in and out of criticized category so there can be some volatility in that but the general thought from our perspective is that the portfolio is accurately rated the migration that was negative is still maybe perhaps slightly negative bias but i would say its showing signs of stability that gives us a lot of comfort in terms of our guidance and then to your point as it relates to ci and cre theres no question that that weve seen the the ci stress come through again within our expectations but the ci stress come through which is a function quite frankly of just rates being this high for longer and the general inflation pressures on some of these leveraged corporate credits from our perspective the good news is that that list of challenges continues to get smaller and you couple that with to your point around cre we havent seen the defaults there we certainly have had one or two here or there and we expect that over time but quite frankly todate held up fairly well to kevins point earlier and then finally our senior housing portfolio which gave us some dings and scratches earlier on those macro figures in that industry continue to improve occupancys better rents are better labor costs have stabilized to some degree as well so we kind of do all that calculus and we come up and feel pretty good about where we are and feel pretty confident in guiding to flat to slightly down in chargeoffs and feel pretty good about the position of the portfolio the risk is the unknowns in ci and if we stay rates stay higher for longer but it looks like that risk potentially may be beginning to come off the table as well so were getting a little more optimistic michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 thats great color bob and maybe just to follow up on it your last point kind of leads into it is if we do get a couple rate cuts i would assume that probably too early to call kind of a peak in criticized classified npas things like that but you could definitely make the case i would think right that we would have peaked with a few rate cuts barring the economy not getting really any worse is that fair robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah i think thats generally fair michael i would a little bit of caution there would be while criticizedclassified thats billion right so it takes a fair amount to kind of move that number you get into npls and were sitting at basis points today theres some chunky credits in there so you could have a quarter where it moves up or moves down obviously last quarter we had a big npl that we spoke about on this call so were back down to levels that we feel pretty good about and we quite frankly look ahead and dont see those chunks as i mentioned being quite as big so that gives us some comfort but you could still have some movement there but the general trend line we think particularly to your point as rates come down should be positive for us michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect i appreciate all the color thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you michael robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp thanks michael operator thank you our next question is from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher your line is now open please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks very much bob just to continue your answer from the last question do you see restructurings in cre as possible solutions or is it a little early for those im just curious about our ways to see further progress on the criticized number robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah good morning chris thanks for the question yeah i do i mean we certainly as weve said before i mean our intention is to work with our clients on coming up with solutions if it needs to be restructured then we certainly want to work towards a mutually agreeable structure so i think thats in a broad sense certainly one of the tools in the toolbox we will do that weve done that its not a extendandpretend or whatever the common phrases you hear are from our perspective its lets come up with the right solution i think its a little early to your point probably to make any kind of prediction on that specifically as it relates to office we have chris we have one office loan on nonaccrual today so i mean that weve got a few that are synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 challenged and that are rated certainly and one or two that were working through modifications on and again thatll give us some chunkiness in our fdm categories et cetera but for the most part i think youre dealing with a handful of credits and we feel good about being able to work through them but i do think its a little early to say thats a play that equals a certain amount of dollars for us christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thank you for that and then the chargeoff guidance has been very consistent for quite a while im just curious if you see any risk to that as we head into the next few quarters next year et cetera robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp you know chris we spent a lot of time forecasting i feel good about our forecast i think were not theres a lot of calculus that goes into being comfortable to tell you that we think chargeoffs will be flat to slightly down so we feel good about that and again the reasons why as we spoke about before the list of corporate credits continues to get smaller senior housing continues to improve although weve still got one or two were working through but the macros are good there and commercial real estate to your earlier point continues to hold up well and probably comes out over longer periods of time and you do all that math add it all up that kind of equals where we think well be and why were comfortable with that type of guidance the risk to that is you dont know what you dont know and if rates stay up longer in particularly in ci you could continue to see some pockets of stress but i think theyre isolated i dont think theyre in any particular industry just the general stress of higher rates being higher for longer could certainly could give you a surprise or two but we feel pretty good about where we are right now christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great bob thank you again for the background much appreciated robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp thanks chris operator our next question is from samuel varga with ubs samuel your line is now open please go ahead kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp sam are you there all right esra samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc can you hear me kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp i dont think samuels there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes jennifer demba a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp there you are kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah operator samuel your line is now open please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc are you able to hear me now kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yes i can hear you samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc oh perfect awesome im sorry im not sure what happened there so i just wanted to circle back on the fee income and go specifically to maast its been a long road for the project and i wanted to get an update from you just about the strategic direction should we be thinking about maast as a revenue sort of meaningful revenue driver or has it become a client acquisition tool and thats how we should frame that for the story moving forward kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah samuel i think its still a meaningful revenue opportunity what weve done over the last really six months is weve taken a step back we had users on the platform we had a very active pipeline and what we tried to evaluate is are our products that were offering through the solution at the class that will allow us to continue to expand and have a scalable product and so we kind of took a step back and were rebuilding some of the underlying functionality and capabilities within maast synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 we also are positioning it not as to many as many clients and prospects so we had names in the pipeline were going to try to onboard far fewer and focus on larger clients and not just focus on the isv segment but also the iso segment and so youll hear more in the coming quarters as we relaunch the product with maybe a more surgical view of who the target audience is but we still think its going to be a viable solution that will not only allow us to generate fee income but will also generate core deposits so well talk more about it but were back kind of in the basement working on the products and solutions and well be back out in the market later this year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp and let me jump back in on the fee revenue and catherine you asked the question about the run rate for the second half of the year and i said flat to the second quarter i meant i mean flat to the second quarter its flat to the first half of the year samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc great thank for that and then just a quick followup around capital i guess youve mentioned that obviously buybacks are firmly on the table as they were this past quarter could you just share your thought process around the tradeoff between doing more buybacks versus perhaps another smaller restructure on the bond portfolio andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well when you look at further restructurings of the bond portfolio the payback just gets longer and longer we did the first one we did was about a threeyear payback and the second one was about a fiveyear payback and its just not that attractive to us at that duration when you get beyond there the one we just did was attractive just because of the capital generated from the riskweighted asset optimization efforts and so its unlikely that we will do another repositioning of the securities portfolio and were very comfortable with capital ratios where they are theyre near our target of the highend of the range of to but you should expect to see us continue doing what weve done in the past which is prioritize client growth be ready for client growth when it comes and grow the balance sheet and if were sitting here with excess capital you should see us use share repurchases to balance it out samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for all the color i appreciate it operator thank you very much this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you as we close out todays call id like to thank you all for your attendance and your continued interest in synovus id also like to thank and recognize all of our team members who are listening in today our financial results that we presented this morning are a direct result of what you do daily to serve our clients and differentiate us from our competitors synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2024 during the second quarter we did continue to receive national recognition for our work environment and service excellence we earned a great place to work certification for the fourth year in a row our family office won two awards from the family wealth report our customer care center and team members were awarded several best of the best awards by customer contact week i am proud of our teams and the recognition of their efforts and the impact it has on delivering on our purpose to help people achieve their full potential as we look forward in and we approach i am confident that we will sustain our momentum and see key improvement in our financial performance this confidence is driven by the following facts our net interest margin and our net interest income troughed in the first quarter with deposit prices peaking and future nim expansion fully supported by our actions our credit cost and our credit outlook have improved our fee income has hit a new high watermark due to the broadbased success and execution expenses have been well contained with flat yearoveryear growth and with an adjusted efficiency ratio of this quarter we continue to outperform our peers in addition our efforts to optimize the balance sheet to better position us for growth are largely complete the benefits derived from riskweighted optimization efforts allowed us in the second quarter to restructure the bond portfolio which increased yields by roughly basis points our loan portfolio optimization efforts around third party medical office national syndications and senior housing have resulted in a reduction of billion in outstandings over the last months reducing the percentage of loans in these categories from to our capital levels are eightyear highs and these strong levels provide for additional flexibility and fuel for future growth and lastly we remain wellsituated in a great footprint whatever the economic forecast is for the foreseeable future we have the opportunity for relative outperformance look no further than the recently released atlanta fed research titled poised for more growth the southeastern economy is outperforming the us so yes im optimistic about our future and our ability to drive meaningful and sustainable growth and improved profitability and i look forward to future earnings calls to provide updates on our progress in the meantime we look forward to seeing many of our investors in upcoming meetings and scheduled conferences so for now esra that concludes our second quarter earnings call operator thank you very much everyone for joining this
