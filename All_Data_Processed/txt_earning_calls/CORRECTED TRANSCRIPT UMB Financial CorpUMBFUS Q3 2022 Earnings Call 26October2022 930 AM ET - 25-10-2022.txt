umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks to everyone for joining us today yesterday afternoon we reported our third quarter results reflecting positive momentum across our business lines highlights include robust loan growth coupled with strong asset quality and solid core revenue growth net income for the third quarter was million or per share operating pretax preprovision income was million or per share net interest income increased sequentially driven by a nearly billion increase in average loans positive asset mix and the impact of rising rates this was partially negated by increased deposit costs largely driven by a transition from ddas to ratebearing accounts which is typical in an interest rate cycle such as the one were seeing today the timing of deposit initiatives to attract newtobank customers in each of our business lines the availability of attractive shorttenor investment options and the impact of clients reacting to typical market pressures in a rising rate environment particularly on our ratesensitive institutional businesses this is consistent with what were seeing from other trusts and custody banks like ourselves our cycletodate beta on interestbearing deposits have been and on total deposits as weve noted in the past our business profile and funding mix is uniquely skewed in favor of our commercial and institutional sources these sources experience different pace and timing than many of our peers in the repricing environment our businesses performed well driving noninterest income growth excluding the impact of the nonrecurring gain from the sale of visa class b shares in the second quarter additional drivers are included in our slides and ram will share more detail shortly excluding contributions from ppp and the marketrelated impact from the gains and losses on investment securities weve generated operating leverage of yeartodate this continues to be the focus for us and we expect to generate positive operating leverage for the full year pipelines and sales activity continue to be strong across the company and ill share a few highlight from the various businesses in private wealth our team has surpassed fullyear sales bringing it to million in new assets yearto date our institutional banking teams are continuing to perform well yeartodate new business volumes have increased and corporate trust and escrow services and in specialty trust and public finance has closed deals so far in on track to exceed levels fund services and institutional custody assets under administration levels have been impacted by equity market valuations in and aua levels now stand at billion however the teams continue to bring in new clients including more than new custody accounts yeartodate and the fund services contribution to our trust income has increased yearover year in healthcare services we ranked among the top hsa providers in the us we expect the acquisition of the old national bancorps hsa business to close in midnovember this acquisition will bolster our position with an additional million in expense and deposits and approximately million in investment assets moving to lending the drivers behind our nearly linkedquarter annualized growth in average balances this quarter are on slide total topline loan production as shown on slide remained strong at billion for the quarter payoffs and paydown represents of loans rebounding from the low levels second quarter commercial real estate and construction loans posted annualized growth in the third quarter while payoffs will fluctuate from quarter to umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 quarter we expect we will see then eventually begin to slow due to general slowdown as anticipated in the rising rate environment we saw continued outperformance to cni with average balances increasing on a linked quarter annualized basis and making up more than half of this quarters total growth industrial production continues to be strong and were seeing a good mix of new customer acquisition and increased borrowings from existing commercial relationships loan increases are moving closer to prepandemic levels and general customers comments indicates that draws are largely related to ph this leading stimulusliquidity higher inventories and higher prices average residential mortgage balances have increased over the third quarter of last year despite the impact of rising rates our down payment assistance program designed for first time homebuyers in underserved markets has had more than a new applications resulting in million in assistance yeartodate looking ahead to the fourth quarter we see opportunity in our various verticals across the footprint and we expect continued strong growth to round out the year on the other side of the balance sheet average total deposits for the quarter decreased compared to the second quarter driven primarily by dda outflows from elevated second quarter levels primarily in our institutional businesses compared to the third quarter of our dda balances increased led by corporate trust commercial and investor solution verticals because of the often projectbased orientation of our corporate trust businesses we can just as easily see spikes in dda as we have seen a decline this past quarter dda balances represent of average deposits compared to in the second quarter and in the third quarter of last year we continue to focus on deposit gathering including the deposit initiatives i mentioned as well as engaging with our current customers one area of growth were excited about is our business banking and practice finance vertical which has seen exceptional deposit growth over the past few years we continue to invest in this business to drive future growth on both sides of the balance sheet while we see cycletodate beta on our interestbearing deposits of approximately i think the metric alone gives an incomplete view as it ignores the benefit of dda balances which have a zero beta and the impact of our borrowing levels which have been at beta id encourage you to look at our total cost of funds instead which have had a beta of thus far this year additionally we benefit on the earning assets side with cycletodate beta of nearly in this environment we expect loan growth and improving asset yields will continue to drive above peer growth and net interest income moving to asset quality net chargeoffs in the third quarter were just of average loans while nonaccrual loans remained steady at basis points of loans we continue to stress that our fullyear loss rate will be consistent with our longterm historical averages of approximately basis points to basis points or less provision for the quarter of million was driven by our continued strong loan growth portfolio metrics and changes in the macroeconomic outlook our reserve coverage is now at of total loans in september we were successful in raising million in capital through our subordinated notes offering that will help us facilitate our expected balance sheet growth for the remainder of this year and on into our own umb capital markets team participated as comanager bringing in clients that made up about a third of the total offering the capital raise favorably impacted our ratios september total capital and leverage ratios were and respectively and in our press release we announced that the board had approved a increase in our dividend bringing it to per share payable in january umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 finally weve seen many changes in the outlook for markets and the economy in the last few months weve got unprecedented fed tightening and record inflation along with uncharacteristically tight labor market and geopolitical conflict along with contagion effect from across the atlantic have increased economic uncertainty we have active dialogues with our own clients about their businesses and outlooks borrowers are generally optimistic about the rest of and remain cautiously so looking forward although most are concerned about rising costs while our customers are in good shape we like many others expect that we may experience a shorter recessionary environment historically the leading economic index or the lei has become a good indicator in more than years of history a drop in the sixmonth rate of the lei below negative has proceeded through the recession as of last week the index was at negative further decreasing from a negative at the end of august unlike the previous cycle banks came into this cycle with stronger capital positions and the consumers came in more liquid and less leveraged therefore we dont expect it to be as destructive but more of a reset to the economy as i mentioned we see good growth opportunities in the fourth quarter although well continue to watch closely for early warning signs for deterioration which at this point seem to be contained in specific areas such as consumer and discretionary this is where we differentiate ourselves by rowing close to shore which is part of our risk management philosophy that keeps us prepared for all environments in closing im proud of our teams as always as they continue to work together and work hard to support our customers and communities now ill turn it over to ram for additional comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner let me start with some commentary on balance sheet trends starting with our liquidity profile on page our fed account reverse repo and cash balances further declined to billion and now comprises of average earning assets with a blended yield of compared to basis points in the second quarter as weve done in prior tightening cycles we deployed cash flows from our highquality securities portfolio to fund loan growth opportunities during the third quarter as shown on slide the portfolio rolloff for the third quarter was million at a yield of while we purchased million in securities primarily clos with a yield of additionally the portfolio is expected to generate over billion of cash flow in the next months the yield of those securities rolling off is approximately while treasury yields present very attractive reinvestment levels our priority is to fund the opportunities we continue to see in our lending verticals in we reclassified securities to the heldtomaturity portfolio to help manage tangible capital and reduce the impact of rising rates on our equity average htm balances for the third quarter excluding the billion of revenue bonds weve long held in that book were billion loan yields increased basis points from the second quarter to with a cycletodate beta of approximately or about billion of loans are variable rate with of those repricing in the next quarter and repricing within the next months these are largely tied to indices at the short end of the curve the total cost of deposits including ddas was basis points up from basis points last quarter and the cycle todate beta is approximately net interest margin expanded basis points from the second quarter net interest margin benefited by approximately basis points from loan repricing and mix basis points from the umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 benefit of free funds and basis points from reduced liquidity balances and rate these were partially offset by a negative basis points related to the cost and mix of interestbearing liabilities as we look ahead there are a lot of variables at play that will impact the trajectory of our net interest margin including the depth and duration of the feds tightening cycle outlook for equity markets and that impact on deposits expected disintermediation of dda balances as ecr rates increase as well as our own need to generate deposits through targeted campaigns to fund loan growth based on our own simulations which includes the midquarter onboarding of hsa deposits from old national and the seasonal inflow of indexed public funds deposits we expect our fourth quarter net interest margin to be flat to slightly down from third quarter levels this assumes a fed funds rate of at yearend as mariner noted while deposits and deposit betas and nim is important we focus primarily on net interest income growth as illustrated primarily by loan growth additionally as youve heard i say before another metric that we manage too is the loantodeposit ratio limit of with our ratio approaching we will continue to focus on deposits and client acquisitions across all our lines of business the estimated impact of net interest income in various rate scenarios based on ph september balances is shown on slide in a rate ramp scenario of plus basis points on a static balance sheet net interest income is predicted to fall in year one and increase by in year two this analysis assumes repricing of our variable rate loans based on underlying changes to libor sofr and other indices as well as well as deposit betas consistent with the prior cycle one variable thats missing in this prescribed analysis is what happens to our growthrelated net interest income the ultimate effect of incremental rate hikes on nii will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements loan growth and balance sheet management strategies back to the income statement total fee income for the quarter was million the second quarter included a million pretax gain on the sale of our visa class b shares recorded in investment securities gains as shown in the commentary on slide early in our presentation fee income excluding income or loss from equity valuations was million compared to million in the second quarter this variance included a million increase in companyowned life insurance income and a million increase in derivative income related to customer backtoback swaps other areas of strong performance include card services income and brokerage fees the latter of which captures our money market revenue share and fee income total brokerage income increased million or nearly compared to the second quarter despite market related compression of approximately in the underlying money market balances other drivers were shown on slide and are discussed in the press release slide shows trends in our noninterest expense the linked quarter increase was driven primarily by the change in deferred compensation expense which was million in the third quarter versus the credit of million in the second quarter this is related to the increased coli income i mentioned previously we saw a million increase in salary and wage expense reflecting one additional salary day in the quarter as well as selective hiring in some of our lines of businesses additionally we booked million of operational losses which are not expected to recur these increases were offset by an increase of billion in charitable contributions expense recorded in other expense umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 a few other items to keep in mind as we look at expenses going forward in october the fdic announced the basis point increase in the settlement rates beginning in the first quarter of based on current data we estimate this will have an approximate impact of million pretax and fourth quarter expenses will include the yet to be determined prorata amortization impact from the acquisition of million in hsa deposits expected to close midquarter finally like in prior fourth quarter periods we will make a million charitable contribution to organizations serving our communities as well as making any needed trueups to performancebased in central accruals as mariner noted as we approach our budget increase our focus remains on generating positive operating leverage while prudently investing in our businesses our effective tax rate was for the third quarter and yeartodate reflecting a smaller portion of income from tax exempt municipal securities for the fullyear we estimated to be approximately to that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo jared your line is now open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning everybody mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hi jared ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just starting on deposits if we look at sort of the dda levels precovid you were around should we expect that we sort of trend back towards that level with the pressure on dda from the ecr and the other items you mentioned or do you think theres some systemic or structural change that could keep that at a higher level mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i think this is mariner some of the dda drawdown thats happened over the quarter has been based on obviously the higher rate environment and the customers looking to participate in that as well as higher costs and inflation such as customers that put their money to work in an inflationary environment i think as you look umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 forward just specifically thinking about ddas as you look forward into a recessionary environment or beyond that and more normalized environment ddas should remain at strong levels as they have been in the past jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess this ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and one of the jared this is ram and i would say weve added a lot of new clients over the last months on the heels of the ppp program that we talked about the halo effect of the ppp program so when you think about new clients right so yeah right the last great cycle we did go down to composition but this time around i think we feel like itll be higher than that as the rate cycle peaks because weve been adding new clients with dda balances as well particularly in small business you heard mariner talk about the efforts of small business and how that is driven some dda growth so i would say we probably end up doing better than last cycle mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah so a temporary short squeeze on that i guess is the way to describe it jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay i guess just following up on that or on the deposit side how should we be thinking about through the cycle beta now i think we saw a little bit of an acceleration on interestbearing deposits cost this quarter how are we thinking about how should we think about through the cycle beta either i guess on the interestbearing or on total since youre you seem to focus on that a little more ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah we obviously think total is the way to think about it and the total was in the low30 range i think if you last quarter or before we telegraphed that we would be early to go through the cycle as a more commercial and institutionallyheavy deposit base for our company and thats basically what weve produced we still expect to end whatever cycle we have similar to the last cycle and we dont have any reason to expect that to be any different we feel like were tracking that way so we end up in the round of somewhere a couple of clicks one way or the other we were around last time weve telegraphed that in the last couple calls thats where our expectations are well see how that ends up but i dont have anything telling us it being anything other than that and the way we believe it is on a relative basis we just go through it earlier and then you also have to think about obviously total cost not just the interest bearing just keep that in mind and then lastly you cant forget the impact of what were able to do on the asset side so with more than of our loans repricing within months we got the repricing of the current book the back book and then a significant portion of our loan growth is from new customers and all of the new customer growth comes in at a higher yield so our loantoasset betas were on a linkedquarter basis and cycle todate we expect to continue to perform well on the asset side and particularly on the loan side umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just to confirm that deposit beta is total right ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc ph through that yeah okay and then on the coli side with the corresponding expense is this a third quarter sort of a onetime thing or is this now a new level from additional purchases ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no we have it quarter in quarter out thats part of our deferred comp administration so we try to mimic those assets and any marktomarket fluctuations get written up or down in fee income just like we have this product deferred comp expenses so we try to break it out so last quarter because of what happened to the equity market our deferred comp expense or coli income came down by about million and this quarter it recovered to a positive million creating a million so this quarters impact of fee income at the benefit from coli was only million same thing on the deferred comp side we had more expenses of about million reflected in our million expense base mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp that activity happens every quarter ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great good morning a umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc ram i think in your prepared remarks you said you talked about a ultimate terminal loantodeposit ratio so you got plenty of room im kind of interested in i guess when and how you get there i understand the comments on loan growth and also saw you really didnt buy any bonds in the quarter but is the math deposits continue to be positive but perhaps trail loan growth or do we see more downdraft in the deposits and securities book mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well we fully expect to continue to grow our deposits and weve become much more active in the market competing in this environment where our customers have options and as the short end of the curve has come up the way it has its a different environment than weve seen in the past where obviously customers have lots of options in this rate environment so weve been we remain competitive and more so recently so that we can keep up with our loan growth and then the real goal and job of ours is to remain disciplined on our loan pricing and we believe we can do that so then its ultimately about maintenance in our margin and spread more and growing our net interest income than it is worrying about deposit betas which we really cant control in this environment so we focus on all good stuff the growth and the drivers we think we can continue to produce above pure level growth both on the asset side and on the fee side weve done that for a long time in the years ive been ceo weve met the expectations and delivered the growth we expect of ourselves and we expect to continue to do that and when the fed pivots when we get that announcement that will renormalize the cost side of our structure so this is really a shortterm problem we dont manage this company for the quarter we manage it for multiple years in advance and our growth profile remains very strong and when the fed pivots things will normalize for us christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for that color mariner ram the billion of bonds that come due over the next year i guess fair to say that new money this is more accretive to put those into the loan book and perhaps shrink the bond portfolio ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats right yeah we dont the last three to four months we have not reinvested other than a very tiny sliver into clos weve not reinvested our cash flows and its all part of the loan to deposit question that you asked previously managing that i mean we can do weve done this in the past with balance sheet rotation indiscernible same playbook mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and weve just become more active pursuing those deposits more recently as the excess liquidity has been absorbed into the market umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yep got it maybe just one housekeeping question the million fdic thats a bump on an annual basis right ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah thats annual number yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the i think you said youre still finalizing the incremental expense on the deposit deal but i think old national disclosed that there was a roughly million premium paid for those million deposits how do i think about just incremental intangible assets in the back of capitals is it that full amount of money that goes into intangibles ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats the part were still working on so its hard to give you a number right now but i just wanted to show that there that expenses will include that so the classification between business goodwill and intangibles that gets amortized were still going through the calculations of that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but the million is just its just a split how thats split but the million is the right number ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp correct christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks thanks a lot ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks chris operator thanks for your question operator instructions our next question comes from the line of nathan race with piper sandler nathan your line is now open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi everyone good morning thanks for taking the questions umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning nate mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co question on the operating leverage outlook obviously some nice improvement this quarter do you think the improvement that we saw in your efficiency ratio here in the third quarter is sustainable in this type of rate environment or how are you guys going to think about managing expenses going forward apart from kind of the trueup that you had in compensation costs and let it be strong production that youve seen so far this year ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so a lot of the expenses that weve talked about in the past tend to be variable in nature and driven by overall company performance or indiscernible production right so the fact that were focused on positive operating leverage for the fourth quarter and for the budget would suggest that the efficiency ratio will improve from here so obviously well be investing as we said in the prepared remarks well be investing in our businesses hiring for and but at the same time well react to the revenue environment and whats happening on the revenue side of the equation nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay got it and then just maybe turning to the outlook for provision going forward i imagine growth may moderate in this macro environment to maybe the high singledigit range kind of consistent with your historical trajectory over time how do you guys think about providing for that type of growth trajectory going forward and absent any kind of ceclrelated adjustments on the q factors mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well its hard to do a absent cecl but because thats a big driver i think a big portion of our third quarter provision was from loan growth and so thats that was the largest number in there and obviously our loan quality is incredibly strong so the combination really going forward for provisioning will be from outsized loan growth and macro environment statistics driven by our moodys information and i suppose your guess is as good as ours so i would suggest that that data will not be getting any better anytime soon so as you think about the fourth quarter we expect to have strong loan growth and at least i dont who knows what moodys will say i dont think its necessarily getting any worse but its certainly not going to get any better that data so its an indiscernible deal based on whats going on in the economy with unemployment and whats going on with the loan growth nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 okay great and then just on the heels of the debt raised recently obviously indiscernible those supportive of some pretty strong loan growth in the quarter just curious if that added capital buffer is perhaps supportive of some increased ma dialogue of later if youre feeling kind of more or less optimistic on additional acquisitions outside the deposits that will be coming on board in the fourth quarter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we remain active in pursuit of acquisitions we continue to pursue those wed like to add solid franchises to the base of our organization when we can find the right deal that fits and so nothing new there just were active in our calling efforts nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great id appreciate you guys taking the questions and all the color ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of john rodis with janney john your line is now open john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc good morning everybody ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning john john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc ram just back to the expense looking at expenses for the quarter what is the right number to back out for this quarter for the coli impact is it the million or is it the million just to sort of get a good run rate going forward ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah just on the deferred comp i would take out million and then weve talked about an operating loss for about million and then there were some million to million of timingrelated expenses on travel and marketing campaign so we started with a million of reported expenses there were some onetime items i would put them in the million to million category of things that we dont control or dont expect to recur so the run rate i would say is closer to 223ish million and then all the other items that i talked about in terms of the charitable contribution just for the fourth quarter the fdic assessment increase for starting and then the amort related to the hsa purchase umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yep okay so okay so million for the third quarter okay thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp just for the third quarter correct yeah john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay thank you operator thank you for your question operator instructions our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james david your line is now open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey good morning david ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc looking at the reserve build in the quarter i know youre pointing to the loan growth side of things was the loans that you added require additional reserves it just looks to me like the addition if youre using your overall reserve level the loan growth should have been a smaller contributor just curious what maybe loans you added and then what else may have contributed to the build in the quarter mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean the loan growth in the quarter was million ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp million mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 million and so it was pretty significant component of it its driven by cecl its a mathematical equation that requires us to do what we do i dont know if that answers your question but its it was a significant quarter in loan growth and so we provisioned against it ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp each new loan that comes on the books requires a reserve a percentage of reserve so by definition new loans will have to reserve requirement right out of the gate david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc sure got it okay and then taking this a step further looking at your total reserve level when cecl came out we thought it was going to be very quantitative and what weve heard since then is theres a good qualitative portion can you discern between the two is there a portion of your reserve that youd say is qualitative versus quantitative and how much of it would be qualitative if so ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp its hard to give you that specifically but there is i would call the qualitative piece on the margin is what i would describe that as and the majority of it is driven by quantitative mathematical mathematically driven based on loss history roll on and roll off loan growth and macroeconomic environment and then you got a piece of it that we can use our own assessment of the environment and our own balance sheet and our own dynamics on a qualitative basis to move that up or down on a market basis david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you operator thank you for your question there are no more questions waiting at this time so i will pass the call back to our management team for closing remarks thank you mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah this is mariner i might just wrap it up by reiterating our thesis for where we stand and some of the concerns in the marketplace for the industry around deposit betas and kind of how we see that shaping up for us specifically as weve been saying now for a few quarters we are largely institutional commercial thats not new our base deposit base is not new and weve been here before ive been ceo years weve seen this before we just telegraphed that were going to go through it early weve gone through it early we still expect to come in right where we thought we would in the low50 range on the beta side and we think that you as analysts and investors should focus more on the whole balance sheet and nii as they are the drivers for our success and performance long term our ability to grow our loans our ability to have strong quality with basis points of chargeoffs and basis points on the nonperforming side umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 so we think that on a riskadjusted basis with the growth that we have we think you should focus more on the profile of the business and less on the shortterm fed actions squeezed and the fed will kind of pivot soon that will normalize our costs and you will be left with what you normally see with us which is an outsized growth profile with a betterthanaverage risk profile so that has all remained the same and we expect to see fourth quarter loan growth as strong as it was in the third quarter with the same kind of quality and so theres nothing new here on our end we just got to live through the short squeeze in the fret and we appreciate your continued interest and well keep after it kay gregory senior vice president directorinvestor relations umb financial corp thanks mariner
