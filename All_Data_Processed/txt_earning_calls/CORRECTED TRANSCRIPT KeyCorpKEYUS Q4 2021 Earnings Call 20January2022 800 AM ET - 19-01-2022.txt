our population of senior bankers by and we expect further growth in we also saw strong momentum in our consumer business we grew net new households at a record pace and we continue to expand our existing client relationships our strongest growth in came from the western part of our franchise which grew households at over times the rate of the rest of our footprint consumer loans in our western franchise were up last year we are also seeing very strong growth with younger clients of our new households are under we continue to benefit from two consumer growth engines laurel road and consumer mortgage combined these businesses generated a record billion in originations for the year ending we also continue to invest in order to support future growth in addition to growing the number of bankers we have continued to make meaningful investments in digital and analytics these investments have accelerated our growth improved our efficiency and enhanced the client experience in we launched our national digital keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 affinity bank laurel road for doctors which expanded our consumer footprint nationally for a very targeted high quality client segment of our new business is coming from outside of our traditional 15state footprint we also acquired aqn strategies a leading consumerfocused analytics firm and most recently we acquired xup a b2bfocused digital payments platform that provides an integrated and seamless onboarding experience foundational to our model is a relentless focus on maintaining our risk discipline credit quality remained strong throughout the year as net chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans remained at historically low levels we will continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles finally we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders in we returned of our net income to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases we are committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders i am very proud of our accomplishments in i want to thank our teammates for their dedication and commitment to serving our clients and growing our business i am confident in our future we are positioned to deliver on our commitments now ill turn it over to don to provide more details on the results for the quarter and our outlook for don donald r kimble vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share up from last year our results reflect record performance from many of our businesses as well as continued strong credit metrics importantly we delivered positive operating leverage for both the fourth quarter and the full year we also achieved record revenue for both the fourth quarter and full year we had yearoveryear growth in both net interest income and noninterest income our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was i will cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion down from the yearago period and down less than from the prior quarter the driver of the decline from both periods was a decrease in average ppp balances as we helped clients take advantage of loan forgiveness forgiveness this quarter was billion importantly we saw core growth in both our commercial and industrial books as well as commercial real estate portfolios versus the prior year and prior quarter if we adjust for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio last quarter as well as the impact of ppp our core loans were up approximately billion on average or and up over billion or on an ending basis from the prior quarter on the consumer side we continue to see strong momentum driven by laurel road and consumer mortgage combined these businesses originated billion of high quality loans this quarter continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the fourth quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and up billion or from the prior quarter the linked quarter and year ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances the growth was partially offset by continued and expected decline in time deposits keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 our cost of interestbearing deposits remained unchanged at basis points we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately of the total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the fourth quarter of compared to billion a year ago and billion for the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter both net interest income and net interest margin reflects the impact of lower investment yields as well as the exit of the indirect auto loan portfolio last quarter which impacted our net interest margin by basis points these were largely offset by a favorable earning asset mix the net interest margin was also impacted by elevated levels of liquidity as we continued to experience higher levels of deposit inflows in couple of areas of interest in the past have been the impact of the repricing of our interest rate swap portfolio and the potential benefit from investing our excess liquidity position today the current market rates actually exceed the average received fixed rate of our current swap portfolio also if we reinvested the billion of liquidity our benefit to net interest income would be about million a year weve also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and assetliability position moving on to slide we reported record noninterest income for both the quarter and full year noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the third quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest income increased the increase was largely driven by an alltime high quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees which reached million additionally commercial mortgage servicing fees increased million yearoveryear offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees reflecting higher balance sheet retention and lower gain on sale margins compared to the third quarter noninterest income increased by million again primarily driven by the record fourth quarter investment banking and debt placement fees other notable drivers were other income and commercial mortgage servicing fees which increased million and million respectively partially offsetting this was a million decrease in cards and payments income driven by lower prepaid card revenues im now on slide noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to billion last year and billion in the prior quarter our expense levels reflect higher productionrelated incentives related to our record revenue generation as well as the investments weve made to drive future growth our expense levels in reflect a number of direct investments as chris mentioned we invested in our team including adding new senior bankers we invested in laurel road in the rollout of our national digital bank in the team and in increased marketing and weve strengthened our digital and analytics capability including the acquisitions of aqn and xup these investments correlated to higher levels of personnel costs from increasing hiring as well as the productionrelated incentives on the nonpersonnel side we saw an increase in business services and professional fees computer processing expense and marketing now moving to slide overall credit quality continues to outperform expectations for the fourth quarter net chargeoffs remained at historic lows and were million or basis points of average loans our provision for credit losses was million this reflects our continued strong credit measures as well as our outlook for the keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 overall economy and loan production nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of million or from the prior quarter now on to slide we ended the fourth quarter with common equity tier ratio of with our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders importantly we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities the final settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program disclosed last quarter was reflected in our share count this quarter no additional open market repurchases were executed additionally our board of directors approved a fourth quarter dividend increase of which now places our dividend at per common share on slide is our full year outlook the guidance is relative to our full year results and ranges are shown on the slide importantly using the midpoints of our guidance ranges which support chris comments about delivering another year of positive operating leverage in average loans will be up lowsingle digits on a reported basis excluding ppp and the impact of the sale of our indirect auto business average loans will be up lowdouble digits we expect continued growth in average deposits which should be up lowsingle digits net interest income is expected to be relatively stable reflecting lower fees from ppp forgiveness offset by growth in the average earning assets primarily loan balances our guidance assumes three rate increases in with the last one in december which would not have a meaningful impact on our results for the year on a reported basis noninterest income would be down lowsingle digits reflecting lower prepaid card revenue related to the support of government programs excluding prepaid card our noninterest income would be relatively stable we expect noninterest expense to be down lowsingle digits once again adjusting for the expected reduction in expenses related to prepaid cards expenses would be relatively stable for the year we expect net chargeoffs to be in the range of to basis points given our strong credit trends we would expect lower loss rates to remain below our range early in the year and to move modestly higher later in the year and our guidance for the gaap tax rate is approximately finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining a moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive return overall it was a strong quarter and a good finish to the year and we remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our commitment to all of our stakeholders with that ill now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the qa portion of the call operator keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of the main drivers of loan growth that you expect in your lowsingle digit average loan growth outlook for where do you think youre going to see the biggest upside where are you seeing some of the momentum building and then related to that i know the endof period balances pointed to or came in above the average balances on the loan side is that a good jumping off point as we model loan growth for next year thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp sure john so as you look at it in the last couple years weve had the benefit of a lot of strength in the consumer loan engines that weve built around both mortgage which is up basically since and of course laurel road which has exceeded our expectations as we look forward i think youre going to see the commercial side leading the growth and if you look back from the second quarter to the third quarter and the third quarter to the fourth quarter we had total loan growth of in each of those quarters adjusted for both ppp and indirect auto and where i think youre going to see the growth continue is first of all lets talk a little bit about just what the utilization rates are our historic utilization rates have been mid right now were at every that we go up is billion so thats one source of growth we called the bottom of that at the end of the second quarter and this quarter for example were up basis points on utilization its my view that once people can get product they will probably build inventory to a degree even greater than they had prior and thats because i think people have learned a lesson on just in time and also in an inflationary environment theres just not a lot of cost to going long on inventory so to speak other than that we also have in our targeted scale approach we have some areas that really generate outsized loan growth and you think about our focus on healthcare theres certainly a lot of consolidation going on there our focus on technology then we have a couple real drivers that i mentioned in my remarks one is renewable energy which obviously theres a tremendous amount of capital flowing into and the other is this notion of affordable housing which is really a real unmet need in our country so if you think about our backlogs and you think about our current trajectory i think our guidance is pretty logical keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp yeah chris the only two things i would add to that really are again were seeing a lot of benefit from adding senior bankers we talked about adding senior bankers this year and theyre helping to drive that commercial growth for us going forward and so continue to be excited about the benefit from that and then if you look at the periodend balances the only thing that i would caution there is that it still includes about billion worth of ppp balances we saw billion of forgiveness this past quarter and so that will become a smaller and smaller part of the overall pie but still excited and optimistic about the growth going forward john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for that and then separately a common question that we get for you guys just given how solid your capital markets and id business has been is the question around the potential indiscernible or if there is a cliff coming in that revenue so can you just give us a little bit of color on how youre thinking about capital markets revenues so as you look at i know you indicated in your prepared remarks that you expect another solid year but just if you can give us a little bit more in terms of how we should think about the run rate thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp sure so this is a business that for the last decade weve had a compound annual growth rate of and so its a business that has a good track record of growing i think its important to note that in this line our investment banking line we dont have any trading revenue so some of the extreme volatility that one might expect to see from trading one we dont have it as part of our business we trade just to provide liquidity for our customers but certainly within our investment banking line we dont have any of those revenues the other thing that gives me comfort our obviously our backlogs are stronger today than they were a year ago we have more bankers on the street as don just mentioned out talking to more customers in addition to that weve made other investments we bought boutiques that weve successfully integrated we also have hired groups of bankers that are on the platform ive said for a long time that i thought that it was a platform that was underleveraged the other thing that gives us a lot of opportunity to do businesses when youre a middle market bank obviously the number of targets as you kind of go down the pyramid expand geometrically and so theres really a lot of potential customers out there for us to be calling on and the customers that we do have because weve picked areas like i just mentioned whether its renewables or affordable housing theres a lot of repeat issuers as a normal part of their business so we have a lot of repeat business john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you and any way to help us think about the how we should think about the level of growth in that line i know you mentioned you expect growth this year but any way to help us think about the magnitude christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp no i think what were really focused on is making sure we continue to maintain growth in that business in spite of coming off of a year where we grew it by keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler and your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys thanks for taking the question christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey don was just hoping you can maybe sort of unpack the expense guidance a little i guess personally i would have thought maybe a little more pressure on the cost side in than what youre guiding to particularly in light of the expectation for such ongoing strength in the investment banking line so maybe just sort of the puts and takes that you see and sort of how youre keeping a lid on overall costs donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp id be happy to that as we mentioned a little bit on the comments that we do expect expenses and also fee income to come down from the expected decline in the prepaid card activity we did see a nice reduction in that in the fourth quarter and the yearoveryear change from that activity should be about million for both fee income and expenses coming down in addition to that we have a similar issue going on with our operating lease area that we reclassified certain leases into capital leases from operating leases and so you see a smaller than that but a reclassification out of fee income and expenses and so it will have a reduction of both of those and then other categories where we would expect to have declines in compared to would include professional fees which we had some programs that finished up here in the fourth quarter and had an artificially high level in the quarter and parts of that we wouldnt expect going into and then incentives many of our incentives are based on how our performance is compared to our plan and we clearly exceeded our planned levels in and so we would expect incentives to be down yearoveryear compared to what we had in now hopefully well have performance that exceeds the expectations again next year or this year i should say and drive that back but well see some outsized performance in revenues there as well and the last piece id like to highlight there as far as expenses is that both in the third and fourth quarter we made additional million contributions to our charitable foundation as a result of some additional fee income that was realized and so we should see a little lower other expense coming through there now you mentioned investments that we will see salaries go up yearoveryear and part of thats just the expectation that merit increases will be higher historically we would see merit increases in the range and because of the market pressures and others we will probably see to merit increases and on top of that continuing to invest in keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 our senior bankers and we grew those at this year our expectations well have another nice year of growth again in and the last piece of growth in expenses will be computer processing that we did see that one line item increase yearoveryear and linked quarter and we would expect to see that continue to go up a little bit overall and so if you mesh all that together and swirled around a little bit is how you get to our guidance of being kind of low down single down lowsingle digits and so i know its a little messy but hopefully that helps provide a little bit more color there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah it does thats perfect and i appreciate the thoughts operator thank you next we will go to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc and your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning chris good morning don christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris can you share with us on the investment banking area i think you guys talked about retaining about of the loans that you put out for these clients can you give us some color on what types of loans are they leverage transactions or are they those lowincome housing mortgages that you referenced can you give us some color about that part of the investment banking business christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp yeah its a wide range gerard and it ranges from investmentgrade debt that we would be distributing to on the other end of the spectrum we would be distributing to fannie freddie fhahud 10year nonrecourse debt and in those instances obviously we wouldnt be retaining any for our balance sheet so its really our kind of criteria for what we hold on our balance sheet and what we distribute first and foremost we start with what is in the clients best interest and when markets are as open as they are now and we have a moderate risk appetite there are certainly other places where we can better serve our clients than on our balance sheet and then the other thing we think about again keeping our moderate risk profile is just not having a lot of risk in any one name so thats kind of how we think about it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and you said something in your comments earlier to a question about the repeatable business how much is can you give us an estimate of how much of your investment banking business are in those industries that constantly need funding keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp in any given year its not unusual for a third to a half of our issuers to be repeat customers of ours and to your question in certain businesses for example if youre a real estate developer in lowincome housing low income which is the same as affordable your business is built around putting these projects in and were in the business of helping them do that and then providing the permanent financing by placing it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and then as a followup question don you guys have done a very good job in changing the image of key on credit from when it was like in the financial crisis and other recessions the consensus and you referenced this as well in your camp about credit remains real strong first half of the year and maybe we start to see normalization trends in the second half of the year is it just more intuitive that you feel that way or is there some modeling that you guys can really see and say yeah okay this cannot be sustained much longer because its been so unusually strong donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp to me its more intuitive ill ask mark to provide a little bit more color there as well but you think about ph at least the consumer has benefited so much from all the stimulus thats been provided and were starting to see some of those stimulus programs actually wind down and so we would expect to see some of the consumer performance start to return to more normal levels delinquency and chargeoff levels for the consumer portfolio are alltime record lows and dont see that as being sustainable longterm commercial i would say its similar that if you look at whats happened on criticized classified nonperforming loans the trends have just been so so positive and dont see anything on the horizon which would suggest that its going to turn anytime soon but gut would just tell you that sometimes youre going to have to start to see some things start to revert back closer to normal mark any thought you would add to that mark w midkiff a chief risk officer memberexecutive leadership teamkeycorp directorkeybank na keycorp yeah no i think you summed it up well don just the general criticized classified npl all those improvements theyll begin to moderate and you get to more of a level bottom as the stimulus programs are pulled back christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp you know whats interesting even though the stimulus programs clearly are waning as we look at our book theres about billion of deposits for our consumers that are greater than prepandemic so theres still a lot of cash in the system for sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it thank you gentlemen christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 thanks gerard operator thank you our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities and your line is open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i wanted to ask about net interest income and i was just wondering don if maybe you could quantify the impact in versus on both the ppp income and the swap income donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure can as far as the ppp loans that weve talked each quarter about what the fee income is that weve realized and the fourth quarter was million and so combined throughout the year the fee income was million in and then on top of that we had normal interest income on the ppp loans of a little over million and so we think that million of income actually gets cut by about million between and and so that clearly is a headwind for us and so if that would have been consistent yearoveryear we would be showing midsingle digit kind of growth rates in net interest income as opposed to what were reporting of being relatively stable as far as the swaps i dont have that off the top of my head as far as the impact for i think the important thing that and weve hit this on the call a little bit is that what were seeing from market rates today actually are at or higher than what the total portfolio of swap received fixed rates are and so in other words ph were seeing a as far as our received fixed rates that we have for our swap book and that is at or below what the current market rates would be for a threeyear or fouryear swap to replace it and the only reason i hesitated as far as the swap impact beyond that peter is it that all depends on the rate assumptions and because we would expect swaps to come down as rates go up because essentially what the swaps do is help convert some of those variable rate loans to float or to fixed rate loans peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and just regarding rates don you mentioned in the prepared remarks three rate hikes and one of them being in december so not much of an impact could you just quantify the impact to net interest income for every basis point rate hike and what youre assuming for deposit betas donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure can each basis points for the full year impact would be about million to million of additional net interest income our assumption right now thats in our assetliability management model would show about a deposit beta were assuming a much lower deposit beta on the first couple of rate moves in our outlook and some of our commercial deposits are tied to changes in libor now sofr and others on the consumer side are more administrative rates so well have a little bit of flexibility there as far as how quickly those rates move up but we would expect to show a lower beta in the first couple of moves and then move to basis beta over time keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks don appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs and your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc wanted to follow up on peters question don on net interest income sensitivity so just wanted to clarify that million to million for each basis points does include a beta and therefore what youre telling us is in reality theres going to be the first few rate hikes should be in theory higher than this million to million donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp i would agree there will be some negative impact initially erika for a few commercial loans to have floors that are above zero but would expect the early rate increases to have more of a lift than that million to million range thats correct erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and what can you remind us of the billion you have in alm swaps what the maturity profile looks like and given expectations for a tightening cycle that goes through what are your plans to replace maturing swaps the debate in terms of capturing more of the rate sensitivity versus replacing the swaps for to protect your nii in the future donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure as far as the swaps they have a duration of years and so if we look at the maturities theres about billion of the billion that mature in that first year we take a look at how were positioned from an asset sensitivity perspective all the time to see where we want to target that right now were showing about a assetsensitive position to the earlier point that was with the assumption of a deposit beta and our appendix we show that for every percentage point decline in that beta our asset sensitivity actually increases by ph and so there is a real impact from that we are getting to the point where the rates are getting more attractive and more consistent with where our outlook would be and so as we look at the loan growth that we would be expecting for this year well have to continue to reassess how much of the swap book we roll over and how much we might add keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 to if were more and more comfortable with that forward curve and able to realize that with the swaps that weve been booking but right now were not assuming any additional swaps beyond just replacing the maturities at this point in time in our outlook erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and if i could sneak one last one for chris so chris i feel like during this earnings season ceos are in two camps those that are letting the rate hikes fall to the bottom line and those that are investing the rate hikes the way don explained your expense outlook clearly there are keyspecific idiosyncrasies your strategy is loud and clear that you invest back in the franchise and you pay for increased client activity but as we think about a year without ppp noise and good loan growth and rate hikes how should we think about positive operating leverage at key in other words are you going to allow more of those rate hikes to drop to the bottom line and therefore positive operating leverage actually widens as we get further into the rate cycle or do you feel like you can keep positive operating leverage stable and take that opportunity to invest christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp its really the latter erika we said today that we will generate positive operating leverage in but that assumes that we are out there and were investing and were investing in our existing people were out successfully hiring people as you know weve made a lot of niche acquisitions we continue to see a lot of flow there so its really we will achieve positive operating leverage but we will clearly invest in our team we think we have a unique platform we think its underleveraged and well continue to invest in it donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp just to reemphasize that point that chris made that think about the headwinds we have in for the ppp program of million and our ppnr numbers there are at billion so its a meaningful increase to our adjusted or core ppnr without that impact of the ppp forgiveness and so we would have had an extremely strong positive operating leverage in and i think were continuing to invest for growth and would expect that to continue to have a nice trajectory into and beyond erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank and your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc you guys are less reliant on overdraft or nonsufficient funds fees than some of your peers but maybe you could give us an update on what your strategy is there going forward given some of the changes in the industry and what the impact would be on your revenues this year and maybe looking out a couple years christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 sure matt so youre right for us its a on a relative basis its not as important but kind of starting at what is most important is were a relationship bank and so it is very very important to us that we have a value proposition that is attractive to our existing customers and to our clients currently of all our checking accounts are what we call hasslefree and by definition you cant overdraft with that account and also there are absolutely no fees on a monthly basis having said that obviously in the last couple weeks theres been a series of changes in sort of where the market is and we will continue to reassess where we are making sure that its a as i say a great value proposition for both our customers and our prospects matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just remind us what those fees totaled in and are you assuming any changes in the guidance christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp so those if you look at overdraft fees for us in i think they were just over and we havent made any formal changes in our model yet as were assessing where were going to come out matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately a quick clarification question don you mentioned about a change in accounting on the leasing impacting the fees and costs and maybe i missed it but do we just essentially take out both of those fees and costs and then it migrates nets out or is there a net interest income impact donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp well for that those two line items you would see them decline by a little bit that wouldnt be completely removed but there are certain leases that we have currently included in our operating lease accounts that will be considered capital leases going forward and so you would see that operating lease income and operating lease expense both decline by million to million yearoveryear from that and you would see the net difference going through the net interest income thats correct matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you next well go to the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities and your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey i guess i have a positive and a negative question let me do the negative question first wage pressure youre hiring a lot of bankers youre seeing wages go up in technology and outside what are you seeing and what are you assuming as part of your expense guidance christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 sure well first of all good morning mike so a couple things we like everybody else are seeing wage pressure and if you go back five years and you look at our entrylevel teammates depending on what they do what their background was what geography theyre in their starting wages are up over so thats over five years thats real and weve been seeing that also theres wage theres certain areas where theres even more wage pressure one would be certain areas around analytics and technology those employees and teammates are obviously very valuable and were recruiting in those areas so you see inflation there and then its pretty well documented we and others gave junior bankers in our investment banking business increases sort of midcycle so thats kind of where weve seen it and from an overall planning perspective we typically would think that we would have merit increases every year were budgeting for to this coming year mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then the positive question no good deed goes unpunished record investment banking markets last year record this year i know you grew and ran that business and youre the only capital markets player that ive heard so far to guide for higher results people have said ceos have said impossible comps normalizing lower yet youre saying it should still go higher now you dont need to put yourself out there with that specific forecast what gives you that extra confidence christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp yeah so its a few things its first of all the fact that and i mentioned this earlier the line item that youre looking at doesnt have any trading in it we trade just for the benefit of our customers liquidity we have a lot of repeat customers we as you know mike have built the business on this notion of targeted scale around certain sectors of the economy that are growing and that need capital places like healthcare technology and i mentioned a couple of the subsectors as well and we continue to add to our platform i mean as i mentioned we have a unique and underleveraged platform that we continue to hire teammates we grew our number of senior bankers by last year im looking at our backlogs obviously theres no guarantees in the deal business but i feel really good about our team and i feel good about the momentum of the business in spite of the fact that as you point out were up yearoveryear mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp thank you operator thank you next well go to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america and your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just don one question on followup around rate sensitivity on slide you outlined billion of cash and shortterm securities in the numbers you provided earlier the million to million what are you assuming in terms of remixing some of that cash into longer dated assets and loans just give us some color on that and also i think chris in the past youve talked about maybe billion or billion in deposits that could leave as things normalize consumers are back out and about give us a perspective on what youre assuming in terms of deposit outflows donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp okay as far as the redeployment of that billion of liquidity that we were thinking that for that the biggest use of that excess liquidity will really come from loan demand we expect from this point forward that our loan balances will outpace deposit balances as far as growth and so that will use up some of that excess liquidity in still be in a strong position after that our assumptions would have us reinvesting the runoff which is about billion a quarter plus another billion to billion a quarter of additional growth and so it doesnt have any significant redeployment of that excess liquidity into the bond market at all but thats something well continue to evaluate and finetune as we go throughout the year on the deposit assumption that we are still guiding to growth yearoveryear in deposits but at a slower pace than what weve seen i will be honest and tell you that over the last few years weve always been wrong as far as our deposit growth and its come in stronger than what we would have expected and the balances are retained longer than what we would have expected but at some point in time we do think some of that cash will be put to work as our commercial company customers start to have opportunities to invest in inventory and other things like that to support their growth and we do believe the consumer at some point in time will start to use some of the cash build up theyve achieved as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess just a separate question on loan growth you talked about some of the ci utilization rates informing your guidance you also talked about the west coast franchise and the household acquisitions been what youre seeing in the rest of the footprint how big is that household acquisition in terms of actually translating into revenue loan growth any color you can provide on that christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 sure well the one data point that i mentioned was in the west we grew our loans on the consumer side by in and a lot of that this goes back to targeted scale a lot of that growth was frankly around mortgages for doctors and dentists ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and is that where we should see growth is tied to consumer within that medical sort of vertical going forward christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp thats one of the areas but i just think the demographics the point i was making on the west is just the demographics are much stronger than other parts of our franchise and its really important for us were focused on growing in the west growing in growth markets and so the opportunity there is about and in terms of households we grew households in in the west ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right and just one if i could sneak in how many more of like xup aqn kind of opportunities are out there and are there any particular areas where youre really focused on when it comes to these acquisitions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp so there are a lot of opportunities because weve been involved in the fintech space as an investor as a partner for well over a decade were pretty tied into the ecosystem its not unusual for us to see or deals a month so there are lot of opportunities our first screen is always how does this help us distinguish ourselves with our customers and a lot of fintechs are very good at taking out one particular pain point for a certain client set and so thats kind of how we look at it so i think therell be a lot of opportunities the interesting thing for us is xup is one of the first fintechs that weve acquired thats exclusively focused on our commercial franchise in the past weve really made investments on the consumer side so i think going forward not at the expense of the consumer side but youll see us continue to invest on the commercial side ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens and your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp good morning terry donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe don just a question for you i was wondering if you could maybe help us think about the first quarter expenses based on some of the comments earlier on this call in the fourth quarter and maybe some of the step up or seasonality that you typically can see donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure we would expect to see some normal seasonality there first quarter tends to be kind of the low spot on revenues for many of the areas the day count is fewer and so that drives a lot of the revenue components capital marketsrelated revenues tend to be lower in the first quarter as well and so with that you would expect to see incentives coming down nicely compared to the fourth quarter as well because we have a high correlation for the incentive calculations to total revenues some of the other expense categories we would expect to see some declines in some of the areas that ive mentioned before including professional fees the op lease expense will start to phase in and some of the other expense categories should also show some declines there because of the nonrecurring type of items that hit us in the fourth quarter also terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and then as a followup is billion a good quarterly run rate for as i think about consumer loan originations and can laurel road continue to grow if the consumer mortgage channel comes down a bit donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp so theres a couple things going on there as you think about our consumer business lets start with laurel road they had obviously about billion of originations in spite of what was a federal student loan payment holiday all year so i think actually theres a little pentup demand there as you think about our mortgage business that will come down in terms of volume we had originations of billion this year were about half purchase half refi we will exceed the mba numbers and take share in both of those but i would expect purchase to continue to rise and obviously based on our forecast for interest rates we would expect refi to drop off rather significantly terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you both keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies and your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc couple quick ones you mentioned that the full year retention of that commercial investment bank originations was you had been doing a little bit more than so im just checking that while the number was good in the fourth quarter did you actually keep a lower percentage and is that a potential driver presuming that the organic origination growth still looks good in your outlook for christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp yeah its a good question really goes back to whats in the clients best interest and there will be some times where a financing we will actually we wont hold any of it sometimes well hold a piece of it so any fluctuation youll see there is really just a function of us taking our clients to the market that we think suits them best ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it so that can move okay don can you talk a little bit about what youre buying securities at today versus whats still running off and how that front bookback book looks going forward donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure last quarter we had a runoff yield of on roughly billion in the fourth quarter we bought securities of ph or excuse me and around the end of the year that had moved up to about ph to its actually north of today so were getting to that point of breakeven as far as the rollover of the investment portfolio as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and last one just on capital youre at thats right around your zone where you want to live so can you talk to us about rwa growth versus buyback and how you think about capital return after the dividend thanks keycorp key corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 donald r kimble a vicechair chief financial officer chief administrative officer memberexecutive leadership team memberexecutive council keycorp sure and i think you hit on our priorities there the first is to continue to support organic growth we have seen strong loan growth and forecasting for continuation of strong loan growth and so that will require additional capital support second is to support a very strong dividend and we did increase the fourth quarter to a share and still continue to target somewhere in that to kind of payout range and then after that use share buybacks to just to manage our overall capital position if youre growing loans at double digit rates youre probably not going to be buying back as many shares as when youre growing loans at say a to range and so that will probably be slower than what it might have been though over the previous years but still view that as an appropriate use of the excess capital generation that we have throughout the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks very much christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer president keycorp thank you operator thank you and with that we have no further questions id like to turn it
