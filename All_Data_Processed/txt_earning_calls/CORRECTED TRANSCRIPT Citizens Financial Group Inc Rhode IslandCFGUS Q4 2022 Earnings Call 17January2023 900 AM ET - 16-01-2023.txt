the medium term ill comment briefly on the financial headlines and let john take you through the details for the quarter our underlying eps was our return on tangible common equity was and the efficiency ratio was sequential operating leverage was and sequential ppnr growth was leading our performance was sequential nii growth reflecting nim expansion of basis points to and relatively stable loans given the impact of a million reduction in our auto portfolio growth was ex this impact deposits were solid with sequential growth and our ldr remained stable at our fee businesses showed resilience and diversity given a challenging environment down about sequentially a number of ma fees pushed into q1 and mortgage results were softer than expected we maintained stable expenses in the quarter and credit metrics remained good we boosted our allowance for credit losses to of loans which compares with pro forma day one cecl levels of we restarted our share repurchase activity in q4 buying million of stock and we ended the year with a cet1 ratio of at the top citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 of our targeted range for full year we delivered underlying eps of and rotce of as we captured the benefit of rising rates and our strengthened deposit base the results handily exceeded our beginning of year guide which we included in the appendix of the presentation with respect to our guidance for we assume a slowdown in economic growth to for the year two early fed rate hikes and a q4 cut and inflation getting below by q4 we project moderate loan growth partially offset by continued runoff in our auto book of close to billion overall we see solid nii growth as nim gradually rises to over the year a roughly growth in fees given a rebound in capital markets fees over the course of the year solid expense discipline with core expense growth exacquisition and fdic impacts of to we announced today our top program which targets a million in run rate benefits and about of that is expense impact credit should be manageable with net chargeoffs in the to 35basis point range and we expect to build our acl to to of loans we expect to repurchase a meaningful amount of stock given strong profitability modest loan growth and limited expectation for acquisitions with our cet1 ratio forecast near the highend of our to range capital return to shareholders should approach and yield to investors of our dividends plus capital return via repurchase could top so all in all a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by citizens in and we feel we are well positioned in to continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank we continue to make good progress in executing on our strategic initiatives across consumer commercial and the enterprise weve transformed our deposit base and are reaping the benefits weve adjusted our interest hedging to protect against lower rates through given the improvement in our rotce over time we are raising our mediumterm target to to from to weve stayed focused on positive operating leverage weve captured the benefit of moving to a more normal rate environment and we still have plenty of upside in our fee businesses as market conditions improve exciting times for citizens id like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in we know we can count on you again in the new year and with that ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone big picture was a strong year for citizens with significant delivery of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment most notably we closed our acquisitions of hsbc and isbc we captured the benefit of higher rates with strong nii and nim and our balance sheet and interest rate position were wellmanaged while fee revenues were impacted by the environment we are very wellpositioned across our businesses to capitalize on the upside potential when markets normalize particularly in capital markets mortgage margins and volumes should recover over time and we are excited for the growth prospects arising from our wealth investments we are actively managing our loan portfolio focusing on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business into and beyond we continue to maintain good expense discipline delivering in excess of million of pretax run rate benefit from top generating underlying positive operating leverage for the year and fullyear rotce let me give you the headlines for the financial results referencing slide for the fourth quarter we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was net interest income was up linked quarter with basis points of margin expansion to citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 and relatively stable loans given a planned reduction in our auto portfolio periodend and average loans are broadly stable linked quarter up excluding auto runoff we grew deposits up linked quarter and our ldr was stable at fees showed some resilience amid a challenging environment down linked quarter we saw a modest improvement in capital markets fees driven by underwriting and ma but this was more than offset by a drop in mortgage fees and a ph cvadva impact in our fx and irp business expenses were broadly stable linked quarter overall we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of linked quarter and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to our credit metrics were good with mcos of basis points up basis points linked quarter we recorded a provision for credit losses of million and a reserve build of million this quarter our acl ratio stands at up from at the end of the third quarter and approximately basis points above our pro forma day one cecl adoption coverage ratio our tangible book value per share is up linked quarter next ill provide further details related to the fourth quarter results on slide net interest income was up given higher net interest margin the net interest margin of was up basis points as you can see on the nim mark on the bottom left hand side of the slide a healthy increase in asset yields continues to outpace funding costs reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet with fed funds increasing basis points since the end of our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at through the end of the fourth quarter moving on to slide we posted solid fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates these were fairly stable down linked quarter with lower mortgage and fx and derivatives partly offset by an improvement in capital markets fees focusing on capital markets market volatility continued through the quarter however underwriting and ma advisory fees ticked up we continue to see good strength in our ma pipelines including several deals that were pushed into q1 mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment continued to weigh on production volumes we are seeing pressure on volumes moderating and signs of the industry reducing capacity which should benefit margins over time servicing operating fees were stable card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter on slide expenses were well controlled broadly stable linked quarter our top efficiency program delivered over million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year we are excited to announce the launch of our new top program and ill cover that in a few slides on slide average and periodend loans were broadly stable linked quarter but up exauto runoff with growth in commercial reflecting demand in assetbacked financing and growth in cre primarily reflecting line draws and slower paydowns we are seeing commercial utilization moderated a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this as well as lower capex in anticipation of a softer economy average retail loans are down slightly but up explanned runoff in auto given growth in mortgage and home equity which bring in opportunity for deeper relationships and better riskadjusted returns on slide average deposits were up billion or linked quarter with growth primarily coming from term deposits money market accounts and citizens access savings overall commercial banking deposits were up and consumer banking deposits were broadly stable we feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment our interest bearing deposit costs were up basis points which translates to a cumulative beta broadly consistent with our expectations we began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities we achieved overall deposit growth this quarter and will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits overall liquidity remained citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 strong as we reduced our fhlb advances by billion and increased our cash position at quarter end our periodend ldr improved slightly to moving on to slide we saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter which is still low relative to historical levels nonperforming loans are basis points of total loans up basis points in the third quarter given an increase in commercial largely in cre retail delinquencies continued to remain favorable to historical levels but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is fairing although personal disposable income remains strong debt service as a percentage of disposable income has essentially returned to pre pandemic levels while consumer confidence has stabilized as inflation has eased turning to slide ill walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter while our current credit metrics are good we increased our allowance by million taking into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a modest increase from the third quarter the current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios including those subject to higher risk from inflation supply chain issues higher interest rates and returntooffice trends given these pressures we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress in particular cre office back on slide in the appendix we have provided some additional information about the cre portfolio our total cre allowance coverage of includes elevated coverage for the office portfolio while the multifamily portfolio has a much lower reserve requirement the billion office portfolio includes billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends the remaining billion relates to the general office segment for which we are holding a roughly allowance coverage about of the general office portfolio is incomeproducing and about is located in suburban areas moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio increased to which is at the top end of our range tangible book value per share was up in the quarter and the tangible common equity ratios improved to weve returned a total of million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends our strong capital position combined with our earnings outlook puts us in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases shifting gears a bit starting on slide well cover some of the unique opportunities we have to drive outperformance over the next few years we have tried to be very disciplined in prioritizing the areas that we think have big potential and where we have a right to win so in consumer weve got four big opportunities first is our push into new york metro we are investing in brand marketing doing well in the technology conversions and putting our best people against the market opportunity we are encouraged by our early success with some recent client wins in commercial and the hsbc branches driving some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network the full isbc conversion is just around the corner on presidents weekend and we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customerfocused retail and small business model across the new york market you will see more details on slide and in the appendix importantly we achieved about in run rate of our planned million of investors net expense synergies as of the end of the year and we expect to capture the rest by the middle of the year we also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 moving to wealth we launched a number of exciting initiatives with citizens private client and citizensplus as we ph oriented the business towards financial planningled advice these should really help us penetrate the opportunity with our existing customer base on slide our national expansion is another area where we have a great opportunity to build on our digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years weve moved that to a cloudbased platform and we are adding our other product capabilities so that we can offer a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the youngmass affluent market segment where we might have only had a lending or deposit relationships for our vision is to build a national platform that allows us to serve our customers in a comprehensive way and we have also been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers citizens bank for example is area where we have significant running room weve attracted many new partners up about versus a year ago which should really ramp the business and weve built an industryleading home equity business powered by our innovative fastline process which is enabled by advanced analytics and digital innovations that have drastically reduced originations time moving to the commercial bank on slide and weve filled in all the product gaps acquisitions brought us ma and other advisory capabilities and we built out debt capital markets capabilities organically weve hired some great coverage bankers and we are focused on high growth regions around the country and the right industry verticals to serve larger companies we also have a very strong sponsor coverage and are well positioned to support private equity capital bottom line weve aligned ourselves with the attractive opportunities with a full product set to drive significant market share and fee revenues moving to slide we are excited to announce the launch of our latest top program even as we push forward on offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions it is important to remember that a key to citizens success since our ipo has been our continuous effort to find new revenue pools and realize efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better weve effectively executed our top program achieving a pretax run rate benefit of approximately million at the end of and weve launched top with a goal of an exit run rate of about million in pretax benefits by the end of with that split about between efficiency and revenueoriented initiatives moving to slide ill offer the outlook for the full year which contemplates an economic slowdown and the end of december forward curve view of two basis points fed hikes before an expected basis point cut in the fourth quarter we expect solid nii growth of to and we project our nim to gradually rise towards approximately for the fourth quarter of our overall hedge position is expected to provide a nim floor of about through the fourth quarter of and a gradual basis point decline across the curve commencing in q4 in the fourth quarter we took actions to transition billion of active swaps from to forward starting positions in and weve done even more so far in january to rebalance the distribution of downrate protection youll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide we expect moderate loan growth with average loans up about to we are targeting about billion of spot auto runoff as we shift the portfolio towards products with more attractive riskadjusted returns we expect total average earning assets to be up to on the deposit side we see average deposit growth and a to citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 spot deposit decline with cumulative deposit betas at yearend reaching the high fees are expected to be up to with the capital markets rebound building over the course of the year noninterest expense is expected to be up roughly or about to if you adjust for the full year effect of the hsbc and investors acquisitions and the fdic premium increase if the year unfolds as we expect we should be able to drive about to basis points of positive operating leverage given current macro trends in portfolio originations we expect that our acl ratio will rise to the to level depending upon how the economy fares we expect our cet1 ratio to land at the upper end of our target range of to even with our target payout ratio approaching all of this translates into a rotce in the high teens for on slide we provide the guide for q1 note that q1 is seasonally weak for us with the day count impact and seasonality impacting revenues and taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses moving to slide as bruce mentioned we have completely transformed the franchise since the ipo executing well against our priorities and achieving our desired performance targets and we are ready to raise the bar lifting our rotce target to to the key to the further rotce improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage as we look out over the medium term we should see a recovery in loan and deposit growth and we will continue our balance sheet optimization efforts to focus on deep relationship lending to maximize risk adjusted returns we are wellpositioned to grow fees meaningfully and even if rates come down a bit we expect nii to benefit from the protection weve put on through the swap portfolio you should expect us to stay disciplined on expenses credit is projected to be stable as the economy strengthens and we continue to focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of to over this timeframe we would expect our cet1 ratio to remain within our target range of to to sum up slide we delivered a strong quarter against the backdrop of a dynamic environment and we have a positive outlook for we are ready for the uncertainty of an economic slowdown in with a strong capital liquidity and funding position weve taken actions to protect our nim and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth at the same time we are moving forward executing against our strategy and making important investments in our business that we believe will deliver sustainable growth and outperformance over the medium term with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john and operator why dont we open it up for qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thanks for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co it sounds like you guys rebalanced some of the hedges in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so yearto date so far i was hoping you might please just expand upon how youre thinking on indiscernible changed since last quarter and sort of how you intend to position yourself john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start off i mean big picture asset sensitivity last quarter was around were a little bit below that this quarter just given the way the outlook for the balance sheet appears to be playing out in so as youve seen over time weve taken our asset sensitivity down most of that asset sensitivity is really driven by the short end of the curve which we expect to remain elevated throughout and as a result were looking at some of the down rate protection that we had in place in and just repositioning that out of spotstarting active swaps into forwardstarting swaps into and beyond so were looking to basically push that out and basically get that down rate protection smoothed out into the and periods rather than holding on to all of that down rate protection here in thats the main objective and what we were doing in fourth quarter and weve done a little bit more of that in early and then more broadly were looking at net interest margin that corridor if you will were trying to protect that corridor with at the low end if rates were to fall by basis points out in then youll see a floor of around basis points so you see that to basis points corridor being something that over time is more narrow than you would have seen from us maybe in past cycles so thats the main objective bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would just add to that scott i mean our view in the macro is that the fed likely moves maybe once or twice the forward curves as theyll move up basis points a couple of times and then stop and then typically they would pause for six or seven months before they would cut and so if theres a cut happening it likely happens very late in the year and maybe it could be early next year so guided by that view thats kind of why were pushing out that downside protection a bit citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co terrific thank you very much and then just a separate question it looks like fees will need to rebound fairly meaningfully following the first quarter to hit the guide i know bruce you had mentioned an expectation for improved capital markets through the year maybe just a thought or two on how you see the main drivers of that fee guide as the year progresses please bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure so i think really you put your finger on it there scott is the capital markets business weve had really strong pipelines this year but because of the volatility because of the fact that the fed is still moving higher thats created uncertainty and just an inability to actually get the money to work from private equity or some of the deals done because the financing hasnt been there the way its been in the past and so i think as you going back to that macro forecast as the fed is likely nearing kind of the destination in terms of peak rates i think that starts to loosen up the markets the financing markets youll see less volatility and just a lot of the businesses kind of clocked into our pipelines and start to print and get delivered and well start to see more transactions so just by reference most of the quarters this year our capital markets revenues were at million to million if you go back to the fourth quarter of we had million of fees so roughly double that level so we thought coming into this year that wed have much stronger levels of revenue generation but the good news is we still have a great overall focus on the right sectors in the market weve got a great team and so i think youll see that start to rev up as we see the market conditions improve beyond that im also quite optimistic weve made a lot of investments in the wealth business and again there if you start to see some stability in the asset markets we should get a kind of tailwind from that plus the investments that weve made so i feel confident about that and then id say mortgage is so washed out i keep thinking it cant go any lower and it did in the fourth quarter but i think youre starting to see people exit the business and capacity coming out of the business and so youll start to see margins expand and i think volumes will tick up as we go through the year again linked back to the fed reaching the destination and some stability on rates so those would be the big things im happy to pass the floor in here don do you want to say anything else donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think youve pretty much covered it on cap markets i said this last quarter ill just remind people again we are a middle market investment bank so were not dependent on these giant transactions that need billion of financing we do singles and doubles all day long and our pipelines are reasonably strong with a very heavy content of private equity who is awash with cash so there will be transactions if you dont get ph regular rate transactions youre going to get a lot of restructuring transactions so theres minority capital theres a lot of different ways to skin the cat so were relatively optimistic about whats ahead of us in the coming year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah brendan anything on consumer citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think you nailed it pretty well id say well for the year were projecting slow and steady continued progress and its a bit of a coiled spring when the equity markets really come back but as long as theyre stable we should see some growth id say the other bright spot is debit and atm fees that continue to hit records both through customer engagement and primacy and all the investments we made in the health of the franchise thats also translating into our deposit quality also some restructure on vendor relationships and such thats giving us a bit of a boost there too so that should be a continued area of slow and steady progress on the other side there will continue to be a little bit of pressure still on overdraft income and service charges but were sort of near the bottom bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island most of thats in the run rate brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island most of thats in the run rate were sort of near the bottom which is good that will then move away from being a headwind for us real soon bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay very good r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thats great thank you very much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator thank you your next question comes from the line of peter winter with da davidson your line is now open peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning i wanted to ask on credit john you mentioned that most of the increase in nonperforming loans was commercial real estate i was just wondering was that office related and if you can just give a little bit more color on what your outlook is for office john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe ill just talk about the coverage levels just broadly as you may have seen in our materials that the cre coverage from an allowance standpoint is around basis points but when you carve out some of the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 really high quality stuff in multifamily and credit tenant lease and life science as you get to our general office segment where we have very healthy coverage of around so we are seeing some trends there that are telling us that we should be putting away some reserves to deal with the back to office trends that are a headwind in that space so you get good healthy coverage of around we are seeing some of that kick into the nonaccrual space i would say more broadly even though that goes into nonaccrual our overall cre ltvs are typically around and so you got to distinguish nonaccruals from actual loss content and so even though were putting some allowance away we feel like thats commensurate with the loss content that we see in the book and maybe ill just stop there and bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and don do you want to add donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island no ill just say for the office portfolio but cre in general its first and foremost whos the sponsor and whos the investor and we have a very high quality group of investors that we do business with which are largely institutional second is what msas are you in and where are you and we think suburban will do better than urban and as we said in the comments were heavily weighted to suburban so were going through every single property in the office portfolio well restructure a lot of them with the sponsors weve restructured one already this year where the sponsor contributed equity so were comfortable around where we are with the coverage ratios right now but well be active in restructuring the portfolio but we kind of like the contours of what weve got peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thank you and then just as a followup can you just talk about what changed in the updated margin guidance of towards basis points versus the prior guidance of basis points is it just the higher deposit beta outlook john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and cover that i mean i think more broadly its two overall comments really just given the pace and speed of rate changes and the impact on the migration of the deposit mix that we expect as you get into is really most and the majority of what were looking at and that migration manifests itself in two ways its really the amount of dda migration that we see as well as the cost of relatively low cost deposits that were seeing not only within our platform but across the industry so from that perspective just kind of marking that to market with respect to what were seeing and the trends in the fourth quarter and the rate and curve outlook that we see going throughout the rest of i would hasten to add whats embedded in there nevertheless is a transformed deposit platform that back prior to the pandemic we would have had dda percentages that would be in the low compared with a majority of the portfolio being outside of dda of course but you fastforward to where we are in the fourth quarter and were at of our deposit franchise is sitting in dda thats a significant increase versus prepandemic and we expect to end the year in the sort of the mid to high in the dda space down a little bit from where we are today but nevertheless still very high quality citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 and when you add in consumer indiscernible and consumer savings which is other low cost you end up with still about or more of our deposit portfolio sitting in lowcost categories thats up from the low prior to the pandemic so this has been a multi multiyear transformation of the deposit franchise so i think were basically just calibrating what we expect in which was the majority of what we saw in terms of the decline from basis points to basis points i think you could also add in whats going on with the curve and front bookback book as well when you look at just how quickly rates are rising the front book originations take a longer time to contribute and from that perspective were seeing that being a driver as well and not only the speed of i guess the last point ill make is not only the speed of rates rising but the inversion of the yield curve is something that is also pretty is a headwind to front bookback book just to end it with nevertheless front bookback book is a positive tailwind over time were seeing basis points of positive front bookback book across securities and our fixed rate lending businesses thats still a tailwind and thats going to be a driver into with net interest margins rising just not by quite as much as we thought last quarter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hi good morning wondering bruce i heard your early comments about were at acl day one adjusted for the deals in the low1 now and your comments about yearend im just wondering if you can help us given that youre slowing loan growth and letting the auto book run out how do you just help us understand what youre seeing in terms of what your cecl impact might be looking ahead versus the impact of slower loan growth in terms of that endpoint that youre expecting thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill start john you can pick up but id say what weve done for the past several quarters is kind of keep looking forward as to whats the macro forecast and are there any particular segments of the portfolio that could come under stress given that the fed has continued to push higher and the economic growth has been downgraded so i think theres like i read today that over of the leading economists are projecting a forecast for this year so the reason that weve been building gradually is just taking that into account citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 i think at some point you kind of get the cards turned up in and youll have more information and less uncertainty but we dont see that where we sit today so i think its prudent to continue to view the course likely course is that the acl will go up a couple of basis points a quarter like weve done and get into that to range at some point then youll have seen whatever the recessionary impact is and then youll be looking forward and then you may get to the point where you can release some of those reserves depending on what your chargeoff experience is clearly can the slower loan growth plays into that to some degree is mitigating what the build could have been but anyway those are the dynamics at play john unless you want to add to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill add there i mean just for the last couple of quarters weve had a mild to moderate recession built into the acl and so our peaktotrough gdp decline that we have built into our models are that would be a moderate recession at this point i think the changes you may have seen in the second half of were not quite as much on the expectation that there would be a recession as much as what the collateral value outlook really impact was so when you think about house prices and used car prices et cetera weve been increasing the amount of decline expected so youve got sort of the low to midteens declines now built into our models for both house prices and auto prices over the foreseeable kind of a period and thats not really driving a lot of losses just so you know weve been having a lot of recoveries in the portfolio over the last year or so and so you might see some lower recoveries and thatll have the you saw our loss thats built into our loss forecast for but i think thats an important item that you saw in in terms of our outlook for and ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks and just one quick follow up on the capital points your nearing implies a nice incremental step up in the buyback im just wondering how youre thinking about the mix of the dividend versus the buyback going forward you obviously moved to in the third quarter should we also think about that you would be moving the dividend up in line with increased earnings potential as well within that context john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say what we do here is every year were on a cadence where postccar we basically take that as the opportunity to broadly update our capital return profile over the medium term were looking at to dividend payout and you saw that in some of our mediumterm outlook weve updated that this is going to be more of a buyback return year in because of the outlook for rwas but we take a look at dividend policy and earnings outlook and update whether there should be a change in the dividend after ccar bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would just add to that ken that clearly with the uncertainty in the environment we are being cautious in terms of the lending of kind of risk appetite and so i think that in and of itself creates some additional capital versus what weve had in prior years i also think we still have our plate full in integration of existing acquisitions and we havent seen a whole lot thats attractive at valuation that were interested in on the acquisition front and so i think the combination of operating at very high profitability levels with rotce returns in the highteens plus more modest loan growth and historical more modest acquisition activity than historical creates the opportunity and i think its appropriate given the uncertainty and chance for recession that returning capital to shareholders is citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 the right course of action here so you could expect we would like to raise the dividend during the course of the year and wed also like to get close to that return of capital to shareholders ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great thank you bruce and john operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the overall deposit dynamics i know you expect the to yearoveryear spot decline can you maybe give us a little more color on how you expect overall deposit trends to progress through to get to that to spot decline maybe help us with the magnitude of declines that you think is reasonable here in the coming quarters as you look at deposit flows thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill jump in there i mean i think bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island you start and then maybe pass it to don and brendan john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure yeah thats sounds good yeah i mean i think overall as i mentioned before were seeing deposit migration from a dda perspective as well as from some of our lower cost levels but broadly the mix is superior and improved compared to prepandemic i think were around dda in thats probably going to tick down a bit probably to maybe or so by the end of the year thats part of the story id say some of the higher cost deposits in money markets and savings will be part of the runoff as well such that you get to something along the lines of a to decline spottospot end of into and so id say that you end up with some again improved mix compared to prepandemic but a little bit of mix softening as you get throughout and ill just maybe bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 i would just add i would add to that is that id say we did not take in as much surge deposit as many in our peer group we have a consumertilted deposit base which tends to be more stable and so weve been monitoring that surge deposits quite carefully and we have seen it actually be more sticky than we initially expected i think where youd see a slight runoff probably is more on the commercial side where treasuries have other alternatives besides bank deposits to move some money out but again were relatively protected there because we didnt take in a lot of that money in terms of surge deposits so maybe don you could comment and then brendan donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think our spot is down a little less than yeartoyear we actually ended this year a little higher than we thought we were going to because we had some nice inflow at the end of the year but i think john said it in his comments weve really transformed our deposit base really off the back of our treasury services business so both specialty deposit offerings weve got two that were now in the market with around esg green deposits and carbon offsets and then just a strengthening of our dda deposits with our treasury services business gives us more stability than we would have had in prior years so we feel pretty good about that projection and in general were really managing the balance sheet from a bso standpoint and really were avoiding most new transactions given just a shyness around the credit environment and the uncertainty and were moving clients who arent generating positive returns off the franchise and off the balance sheet so it gives us a little bit of a dynamic that we dont really need to go chase deposits because were keeping the loan side relatively modestly in terms of how it grows brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah without being too redundant to what john mentioned id say consumers have been broadly stable on deposits which is a really good thing and the story for us is going to be controlling the mix but all indications are quite positive were looking at a lot of benchmarking data and were pretty confident that were performing in the top quartile of our peer banks in terms of retention of lowcost deposits as well as interestbearing deposit costs so far in the cycle sort of midway through the cycle so weve got to stay disciplined and manage it well but its been driven by a lot of health improvements household growth improvement in finder fee mix shift to bruces point we were mass affluent and above five years ago were now of our customer base is mass affluent and above so the quality has been quite good on the stimulus front what were seeing is the bottom two deciles of our customer base is essentially back to paycheck to paycheck so that stimulus has already burned off and is in the rearview mirror so the stimulus that remains with us tends to be with the more affluent customers whether thats actual stimulus checks or thats balance parking that happened during covid for not making mortgage payments and not traveling et cetera et cetera were not actually seeing that burnoff as much as were starting to see that rotate out of lowcost deposits into interestbearing which is natural given the state of interest rates so were managing that really tight all the investments weve made in the franchise whether its analytics new products the introduction of citizensplus and our private client group as well as having citizens access to fence off interestbearing deposits to maintain discipline in the core have all been really big levers for us to manage well and all indications we see so far is that were right on track with where we want it to be and dramatically outperforming where we were last time in an upgrade cycle and at worst in line with peers with some signs that we may be doing a bit better which is a big turnaround from where we were five six years ago citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great thank you thats helpful and then separately on the commercial real estate front i know youve stated ltv on overall commercial real estate is that at origination and then do you happen to have refreshed ltvs i know you mentioned that a lot of your deals have sponsor participation but were hearing that with sponsors exiting or refinancing out of certain deals that impact the ltv so the refreshed ltv may be a better read particularly on the office front thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the office the was the office ltvs in terms of not the overall cre book so we think those are still pretty good were refreshing it property by property we havent gone through and done a total refresh on the entirety of the book yet but were kind of working it on the maturing quarterbyquarter maturities and working with the sponsors to either refinance out inject equity or adjust the value of the portfolio and thats what drove the npl this quarter so it was really one real estate deal john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay sorry so that is a refresh number on the office side or is it at origination john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island it was all for at origination john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey everyone this is nathan stein on behalf of matt oconnor on capital so the to medium term cet1 target range thats well above the regulatory minimum youve built reserves a lot and it seems like the conversion timeline of isbc is going really well so i guess my question is why hold so much capital down the road given solid reserves and successful deal integration timeline bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say part of it is just the philosophy of liking to have a strong balance sheet and so i think to is a strong ratio youve seen over time that we originally had a target of and and weve been citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 kind of sliding that down as our profitability goes up and i think the stakeholders gain more confidence that we have a good strategy and were executing well so it wouldnt surprise me at some point where we start to manage down in that range i think the time of today when were looking at a potential recession to be at the top end of that range makes sense but once we get to the other side of that to start to move that down and maybe manage that closer to the bottom end of that range well provide more leverage and then at that point i think we could step back and say do we still need to or can we skinny that down a little bit so i think thats all in front of us we thought at this point given the dynamics around it wouldnt make sense to actually move that target range down nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks and second question is just on loans so the billion auto runoff will offset growth in other areas this year what are your expectations for other loan categories in coming off of a strong thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start there and others can chime in but i mean i think when you look out into we still see very very strong opportunities in the commercial space and within ci and i think something to always keep in mind is our utilization is well below where historical levels would imply we should be and so as you get into the later part of the year you see some recovery in investment in inventories and capex and possibly ma which actually provides financing opportunities we see lots of opportunities across commercial and thats really one of the main drivers when you get into consumer were looking at home equity being a place that we like and card and citizens pay would contribute as well so all of that wraps up to a stable yearoveryear on loans and back to the point around that being taking that otherwise rwa that would have been deployed against auto and some other categories with lower risk adjusted returns and giving that back to shareholders operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i just wanted to follow up on the nim line of questioning i think you brought down the floor for nim from to is that also a function of what you mentioned on the dda migration and the curve and also the fact that you pushed out the forward swaps is the biggest variable on that number mostly the cost of funding side or i guess would there be any changes to that number if the fed cut rates sooner bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start and flip to john its bruce but i think the two numbers are tethered together so if the is now seen to be then your floor is going to also commensurately move lower the good news is in a way is that weve taken the bottom side of that range so previously it was down to back to so it was basis points and now its to so its basis points so anyway i think certainly johns initial answer on the movement down has been focused more on migration the dda and lowcost migration but then also some of the impact from the yield curve on front bookback book has been the other dynamic so those are the things that were watching but john you can pick up from there citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so the only thing id add just remember we constructed we modeled that and theres a lot of assumptions that go into that with respect to what the mix of the balance sheet would be et cetera and what were assuming is a 200basis point gradual decline in that would get you down to that and given that we are still asset sensitive and we havent closed out that position thats really what youre seeing in terms of the decline in net interest margins so as and when we continue to look at ways to lock in protection against down rates you could see that basis points move around based on hedging activities as well as updated views on what the mix of the balance sheet is likely to be in the context of what the fed does bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its a very dynamic process so we look and see where the forward curve say rates are going to be we have our own view of that we see what the valuations we can get and the hedge market are and you can be assured i think weve played our hand quite well so far and well continue to stay really focused on this manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate that and then separately just on the top program can you unpack some of the drivers there of the million in pretax benefits and maybe how quickly those can come out from the expense base over the course of the year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go and cover that id say the one dynamic to keep in mind is that we tend to form these programs and generate a yearend run rate benefit that will contribute for each of them so on the one hand the million will build throughout so that it gets to a run rate when you get to the fourth quarter of but keep in mind we did the same thing with top so theres a full year effect of top that comes in and so when the programs are reasonably similarly sized you can almost use that as an estimate of what the contribution is in any given year and so you have maybe a combined million plus contribution from the full year effect of top hitting and the inyear effect of top hitting and so the big drivers of that really are in couple of places youve got the traditional areas that we focus on which is thirdparty costs and vendor cost management which is an area that weve been thats been contributing over the years as well as continue to optimize the branch network and just being really careful about ensuring that our organizational approach is fit for purpose with respect to what were trying to accomplish in so those are more traditional areas the other places were looking at that have been more recent include maturing our agile delivery model away from a waterfall approach to agile and nextgen technology initiatives continue to contribute as well were working towards a data center exit in were looking to migrate to the cloud from our internal applications and thats contributing in as well but theres a lot of very strategic sort of initiatives that are built within the top program were excited about it its part of who we are and were looking forward to deliver against that next year manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking my questions citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 operator our next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions a couple of questions for you folks firstly the deposit betas that you expect to get to the high given the pace of change in the fourth quarter and your expectation for rate hikes early in the year and not after that should we expect you get to that in q1 any color on that on the pace of it especially given how rates have been going up john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think well not get there in q1 that is an over the year expectation in terms of the cumulative growth i mean i think youll see the growth in cumulative betas begin to moderate and flatten out you get the big jumps early in the cycle so and we began and go way back to the second quarter of our cumulative beta was and then you get to the fourth quarter the cumulative beta is so youve got points just in and then what were looking for in is another points so this is going to and itll increase over time you wont get to in the first quarter it will gradually rise bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island deposits tend to reprice with a lag so even after the fed pauses you still see a little bit of upward pressure on those betas john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thats right vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay but then does that mean bruce the bulk of it is probably early on and just a little further increase after that after the fed jump john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island id say the majority in and it continues to trickle in into and thats built into our outlook vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay different question the second one fee income your guide of about to growth in full year versus how much of that would you expect would come from capital markets or at least whats in your forecast that youre thinking how much comes from capital markets john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 yeah i think theres a big part of it i mean i think back to the big drivers you had capital markets and you heard about card fees from brendan and wealth from brendan as well so those are the three big ones youd see mortgage really bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island a little bit of rebound john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island potentially rebounding as well but a big part of it would come from capital markets from the underwriting perspective and ma advisory just as we may have mentioned in the fourth quarter we saw some deals push from into so thats going to support the capital markets business which by the way over the years has really become a very diversified capital markets business itself i mean just broadening out ma advisory underwriting and loan syndications those businesses really tend to really diversify our overall fee outlook but yeah a good part of it and a good chunk of the growth in comes from capital markets vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator thank you there are no further questions in queue and with that ill turn it over to mr van saun for closing remarks bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great so thanks again everyone for dialing in today we certainly appreciate your interest and support have a great day operator thank you that does conclude todays conference thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect citizens
