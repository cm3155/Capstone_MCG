and an increase in operating return on tangible common equity to average total loans increased linkedquarter to over billion commercial loan balances benefited from solid production primarily in the pittsburgh harrisburg and north and south carolina markets average deposits totaled over billion a decrease from the first quarter largely due to seasonal deposit outflows caused by taxrelated payments and the impact of the inflationary macroeconomic environment on our clients despite the acceleration of deposit competition caused by the recent banking disruption the mix of noninterest bearing deposits to total deposits at june remained relatively stable at the loantodeposit ratio was at quarterend our strong deposit mix was a result of the focus on fostering relationships with our

consumer loan products consumer deposit products will be added by the end of and business products will follow shortly after in the first half of the streamlined process has led to an increase of over in online applications for the month of june compared to a year ago and we expect this number to continue to increase as we actively promote the capability outside of digital we have continued to

will now turn the call over to gary to comment in more detail on our asset quality and credit risk gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone we ended the quarter with our asset quality metrics remaining near historically low levels our performance for the period reflects total delinquency that ended the quarter at basis points npls and oreo at basis points and net chargeoffs at basis points criticized loans were down basis point quarteroverquarter and classified assets were down basis points i will cover these asset quality highlights for the quarter in more detail followed by an update on our office portfolio lets now walk through our credit results total delinquency increased basis points in the quarter and npls and oreo as a percent of total loans were up basis points compared to the prior quarter the increase in npls and oreo was primarily attributed to a single million ci loan placed on nonperforming status at quarterend we reserved for approximately of our exposure this credit surfaced right at the end of the quarter from an emerging issue between our borrower and their primary business partner net chargeoffs for the quarter totaled million or basis points on an annualized basis with basis points reflecting the use of previously established specific reserves total provision expense for the quarter stood at million providing for loan growth and the previously mentioned specific reserve offset by releases from the reduction in classified loans our ending funded reserve increased million in the quarter and stands at million or a solid of loans reflecting our strong position relative to our peers when including acquired unamortized loan discounts our reserve stands at and our npl coverage position remains strong at inclusive of the unamortized loan discounts we remain committed to consistent underwritings and strong credit risk management to maintain a balanced wellpositioned portfolio throughout economic cycles we proactively review and stress test portfolios on an ongoing basis including in the current quarter where we performed a full companywide stress test consistent with prior years we were pleased with the outcome of the results as it confirms that our diversified portfolio and proactive credit risk management enables us to withstand various economic downturn scenarios regarding the office portfolio delinquency remains very low at basis points and criticized loans remained below with no negative migration in the quarter we renewed all commercial real estate loans secured by office properties that matured in the quarter with no downgrades required we have and will continue to proactively manage this portfolio on a loanbyloan basis as part of the indepth reviews we regularly perform in closing asset quality metrics remain near historical lows and we continue to generate diversified loan growth in attractive markets we closely monitor macroeconomic trends and the individual markets in our footprint and well continue to manage risk proactively and aggressively as part of our core credit philosophy which has served us well throughout various economic cycles fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese jr chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will focus on the second quarters financial results and offer guidance updates for the remainder of second quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per diluted common share on both an operating and reported basis bringing total yeartodate operating earnings to per share on a spot basis loans and leases ended the quarter at billion growing million or linkedquarter consumer loans increased million with strong seasonal contributions on the physicians first mortgage program commercial loans and leases grew million or with loan spreads improving from the first quarter levels investment portfolio decreased slightly to billion as we redeployed cash to support loan growth the total securities portfolio remains at a fairly even split between afs and htm with in available for sale and a duration of years at quarterend total deposits ended the quarter at billion a decrease of million linkedquarter or a primarily due to seasonal deposit outflows and taxrelated payments and the impact of the inflationary macroeconomic environment the deposit mix continued to shift this quarter as customers moved million into time deposits partially offsetting the decline of million in interestbearing demand deposits and million in noninterest bearing demand deposits as of june noninterestbearing demand deposits comprised of total deposits compared to at march while the banking industry disruptions clearly accelerated deposit competition we still expect the mix of noninterestbearing demand to total deposits to remain above precovid levels the loantodeposit ratio increased to during the quarter reflecting strong loan growth and the seasonal effect of tax payments on our deposits revenue totaled million driven by net interest income of million and stable noninterest income benefiting from our diversified fee businesses second quarters net interest margin was with the quarterly decline expected to slow as the month of june was the yield on earning assets increased basis points to due to higher yields on loans investment securities and interestbearing deposits with banks while the cost of funds increased basis points to as the cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points to we continue to actively manage our total deposit costs which ended the quarter at bringing the total cumulative deposit betas to we expect to end in the mid turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million a increase from a solid first quarter level service charges increased million or reflecting strong treasury management services and interchange fees offsetting the overdraft practice changes that fnb implemented in the first quarter of dividends on nonmarketable securities increased million or reflecting higher fhlb dividends due to additional borrowings insurance commissions and fees decreased million or due to normal seasonality and strong overall production in the first quarter our wealth management business continued to generate strong contributions with combined revenue of million up on a yearoveryear basis fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 noninterest expense totaled million a decrease of million or nearly from last quarter salaries and employee benefits decreased million primarily from seasonal compensation that occurred in the first quarter partially offset by normal annual merit increases in the second quarter and higher commissions driven by better thanexpected contributions from our mortgage banking and feebased businesses the efficiency ratio equaled given the strong revenue and wellmanaged expenses our capital ratios remained solid throughout the quarter with a cet1 ratio at our targeted level our tce ended the quarter at and when adjusting for our heldtomaturity investment market equaled which we expect to remain higher than peer median levels we also repurchased million shares during the quarter at a weighted average price of tangible book value per common share was at june an increase of per share from march largely from the higher level of earnings offsetting the increased impact of aoci which reduced tangible book value by per share compared to at the end of the prior quarter lets now look at the financial objectives starting with the balance sheet on a fullyear spot basis we maintain our previous guide for loans to increase midsingle digits yearoveryear total deposit balances are revised and down lowsingle digits relative to the december spot balances we expect yearend levels to be flattish to the june level of billion as seasonality should become a tailwind in the second half of fullyear net interest income is expected to be between billion and billion with the third quarter of between million to million our guidance currently assumes a 25basispoint rate hike next week then flat for the remainder of the year the decrease in guidance from last quarter is largely related to our expectations of higher deposit betas driven by strong competition for deposits and continued mix shift into time deposits we still expect the ratio of noninterestbearing demand to total deposits to remain above precovid levels fullyear noninterest income is expected to be between million and million with the third quarter expected to be around million this upward revision incorporates the benefit of our diversified feebased income strategy fullyear guidance for noninterest expense on an operating basis is expected to be at the high end of our prior guidance of million to million largely due to higher commissions tied to betterthan expected fee income the third quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between million to million fullyear provision guidance remains million to million and is dependent on net loan growth and potential cecl modelrelated bills from a softer macroeconomic environment lastly the effective tax rate should be between and for the full year which does not include any investment tax credit activity that may occur with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince fnb achieved another solid quarter our financial performance stands out because of our innovative suite of products and services conservative balance sheet management and our culture rooted in risk management all of this is made possible by our talented and dedicated employees our philosophy enables us

and americas best in state banks with the latter award based on customer feedback showcasing the impact our employees have on our performance our capital position remains strong with cet1 at our targeted operating level of while supporting loan growth and share repurchase activity in the quarter the tangible book value per share continues to grow totaling this quarter up yearoveryear as we look to the second half of the year we remain uniquely positioned to capitalize on disruption and are poised to continue to drive shareholder value question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys thanks for taking my question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi daniel gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc i guess first yeah just on the noninterest noninterestbearing deposit balances im not sure if i heard you did you have an explicit assumption baked into your guidance for where those end up at the end of the year and i know you mentioned they would end up above precovid i was just wondering if you had a little more detail on whereabouts youre kind of thinking that could land and then also just kind of within the quarter if you had any comments on the cadence of the mix shift if it slowed throughout the quarter if there was any kind of pattern we might pick up on there thank you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say the noninterestbearing deposits we did not have a specific target as a percent of deposits we mentioned were at down from and precovid we were at kind of or so and not looking for us to migrate down to that indiscernible which is kind of we expect to going to be higher than that in my mind the target would be handle if we can keep it to handle as move forward we do have seasonal municipal deposits that kind of build from here through october and november period that would affect that noninterestbearing line item fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and its a big focus in the company its been for years years as far as growing noninterestbearing deposits retail commercial municipal as well as small business indiscernible vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and the shift has changed right and so the second part of that question was about the whats happening as we move forward with the deposit mix vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the mix shift into cds i mean its still a bit pretty heavy but it definitely has slowed i would say on the retail side the requests for matching others rates has definitely slowed significantly from where it was a few quarters ago on the commercial side its still very active as you would expect with every bank indiscernible every other banks customers but i think weve done a very nice job retaining our customers and adding others in the disruption in the marketplace vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and i know we keep mentioning this but part of the reason i think our performance is going to show very well relative to others when you look at the noninterestbearing category in particular because as ive said on numerous calls our strategy has been to focus on client primacy to be the primary bank for our customers the deposit base particularly the noninterestbearing deposit base is supported by compensating balances that are paying for treasury management services and embedded balances that exist with the float and consumer and small business accounts so i think our people have done a pretty good job of continuing that and thats whats really helping us support our noninterestbearing deposit base vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the other thing i would add to i mean as far as kind of a proof point for the mix shift happening during the quarter definitely slowing as we went through the quarter if we look at the margin the margin with everything that all the banks did for reporting purposes in march from march to april our margin went down basis points to a ph precovid level and then we were down basis points from april to may and basis points from may to june so clearly theres been a slowing impact to margin statistics that also runs through the net interest income daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color i appreciate all that and then maybe changing gears here for my second question just on expenses just curious assuming we get through the year youre at kind of the top of the guidance that implies a quarterly run rate maybe and just correct me if im wrong here around the ph mark or so but im wondering if you see any kind of opportunities to reduce expenses going forward given the pressure on the top line vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 i mean weve had a cost savings target every year indiscernible fourth or fifth year of having meaningful cost savings targets for this year ph million and we will see that as we go through the year i mean we run we have a efficiency ratio so its not like theres excess cost to take out but we continue every day to manage the expenses whether its renegotiating contracts particularly one of the things rolling through expenses is just inflationary impacts contracts that have cpi clauses that have kind of kicked in over previous quarters were actively going out to those vendors to look at renegotiating those contracts and get something back for us with cpi where its been at times when weve had some significant increases there process improvement is a big focus in the company throughout so there continues to be opportunity there so its every day danny that were managing the expense side of it were disciplined and were continuing to pursue ways to kind of optimize our facilities space optimization which is just a constant focus so thats something extra kind of baked into what we do every day daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc understood well thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania of course thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator our next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared maybe just following up on that line of commentary for deposits with the prepared remarks of kind of mid beta by yearend i mean that seems like a pretty conservative number i mean beta increased 5percentage point this quarter youre assuming one more hike here is there an expectation that just given how well your deposits have performed so far that theres going to be some element of a lag following the last rate hike or should we assume that kind of once the fed is done borrowing any kind of additional mix shift the cost is going to kind of slow as well vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i mean i think our teams continues to indiscernible strategically managing deposit costs in an especially challenging environment the balancing act there is post failure its been quite an effort throughout our company on the commercial side and the retail side with the fed continuing to raise rates i think that the one more move that everybody expects to happen in february i mean not february next week i dont think it just stops i think theres as i mentioned a little bit earlier there continues to be a lot of competition on the commercial deposit side and weve done a great job retaining our customers for sure and retaining deposits but i think theres some probably carry on that happens as you go through there for some period of time fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 but i mean we the beta at we originally guided in april to mid and always a couple of points higher than kind of use the midpoint of that so based on what we know now and our forecast and how were managing it the mid higher than the low that we kind of guesstimated i would say in april but i think thats a figure that feels reasonable to us and if we can do better thatll be great timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then maybe switching gears to the loan growth i guess two questions number one the resi growth and physicians first program just continues to fire on all cylinders resi is now approaching almost of the loan book i guess a whos taking on mortgages right now is this purchase is this kind of refi activity how much more room is there to run in resi and then as we look ahead whats kind of the mix shift or the mix of loan growth going forward that youre expecting vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah first of all the borrowers in the physicians first program are some of our best credit profiles right so they it tends to be physicians that are well established theyre upgrading their home most of the business that we do is purchase money so the vast majority not just physicians first but across our entire footprint has been historically skewed towards purchase money and thats been our strategy i would expect as we move forward weve kind of changed the focus a little bit so that were producing more saleable product the physicians first loans tend to be balance sheet oriented so the rest of the book has been moving weve been moving more in the direction of producing saleable product which should help us manage the balance sheet as we move forward well comment about the concentrations were aware and capable of adjusting it could include sales and other avenues but we also monitor concentrations but i think overall very high quality borrowers particularly purchase money and the game here is to make sure that we circle back or on the front end of origination thats why we developed the estore is to offer multiple products and services to that group particularly wealth management brokerage insurance feebased high quality feebased businesses and then when we look at we end up also getting opportunities on the business side with the practices and offering treasury management services and loan products to help facilitate the build out or acquisition practice vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania driving those over time as well vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and driving those over time as well so given the thats pretty much our strategy with the mortgage book i will say our goal has been to find originators that really do focus and are networked into the new home purchase market versus relying on refinance activity for production so thats been how weve looked at it for a long time vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 yeah i mean of the originations were purchased so theres very little refi but that will pick up again when rates come down but as we sit here today its virtually all purchase timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last from me maybe one gary were in this period right now where everybody is expecting some sort of credit event in the back end of this year or i guess as youre going through your kind of everyday review of the loan book does anything change with this expectation for some sort of credit event or is it kind of business as usual as youre reviewing those loans are you trying to be more proactive i know youre reviewing all the loans all the cre loans that are coming due this year and next but is there an element of wanting to be more proactive and maybe putting aside additional allowance kind of with this broader sentiment out there or does nothing really change gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah timur i mean for us i would tell you that nothing really changes were very very aggressive risk managers and our program doesnt change from a move in the economy so were going to continue to manage the book portfoliobyportfolio loanbyloan in some cases as weve talked about in the office book with the issues going on in that space at this point but no no real change as far as our risk management practices are concerned just continued to stay ahead of it which is important from our perspective timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the questions vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator the next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just a couple from me on capital vince i think you noted youre kind of right at your cet1 targeted ratio just wondering i would assume including the afs book given the size of the bank thats kind of less of a concern for you guys and maybe some of the larger banks out there that might see changes in capital rules but just wondering about your priorities here if we could see those that cet1 ratio dip down a little bit through growth fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and you guys were a little bit more aggressive in share buybacks than i had in my model just wondering how you think about it here is it just more opportunistic at this point on buybacks vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say so frank i mean weve established that as a operating target for us were right at were not going to manage it to every quarter but given the strong earnings for the quarter as well as where the stock was trading were opportunistic as you mentioned thats kind of the keyword so we were opportunistic well continue to be opportunistic as we go through the year if you look here we have a slide we added in here looking at the cet1 ratio and tce ratio kind of as reported and then with the marks and i think you can see the cet1 ratio at least at march right we were for the peers when you add in afs were versus and then weve added afs and htm were versus so those are all comfortable levels and better than peers and similarly on a tce ratio you can on slide you can see the impact there so i mean given the risk profile of the balance sheet were very comfortable with that the strong earnings generation supported our asset growth and then that enable us to be opportunistic we expect to kind of gradually build cet1 in the second half of the year based on our current forecast and were going to put the money to support loan growth first as we always do and then where theres opportunities to have the loan growth to be a little bit slower than whats in our model well be more active frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great and then just and then just a followup on the deposits you mentioned the seasonality of the muni deposit dollars just wondering just for modeling purposes if you can help with remind us the size in the past of those kind of flows and the expected costs may be of those relative to the rest of the book vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean from peak to trough we usually use million to million is kind of a normal flow from down in the first quarter and then up through kind of the octobernovember timeframe we havent disclosed costs specifically on those i mean weve talked about where were pricing we have some promotional cd rates that we instituted in may that are out there kind of for 13month cd for 7month cd and so far it generated about million in cds since the beginning of may with about twothirds of that being brand new money to the company and some of the municipal customers will take advantage of that too vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and in almost every indiscernible were the primary treasury management provider were not just permitting them raise hot money with us so its less likely that theyll migrate into those higher cost of products and if theres seasonality particularly with ad valorem tax collection and other activities that go on that are seasonal the amount of treasury management fees increase at this point in time so they tend to live more demand deposits to cover the cost of that increase in operations so theres a lot of things going on with that portfolio its not just money flowing in and out in the high yielding fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay so i guess some of that will come in as noninterestbearing vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania right frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just kind of curious if its going to really impact that kind of noninterestbearing trend in a big enough way for us to kind of see it next quarter but maybe not vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont think its going to have a dramatic impact its hard to say though based upon earnings credit rates and what type of investment rate they can get and whether the folks managing those balances at those entities decide to use free balances or benefit from investing so thats all part of it but i just wanted to make clear that were not just basically taking the high yield and its not what we do so vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and on the bulk of the money i referenced will really come through dda side vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania because they collect indiscernible taxes so thatll flow through the noninterestbearing line frank just to clarify that frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats what i was curious on thank you guys vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you operator our next question comes from michael prieto from kbw please go ahead fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start and this question admittedly might be a quarter or so early here but i was wondering if you could give us a little more color on like the incremental cd growth the type of duration and as you guys think about that moving forward at what point does that turn from kind of headwind to tailwind and whats your experience kind of an uncharted territories here but is that something you would hope if your rate forecast proves to be accurate that if the environment cools off you would be able to kind of roll some of that forward lower obviously competitively the cd rates right now are probably the most competitive its been in memory recent memory but just curious how you guys think about that dynamic in the margin as we look ahead to next year at this point vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no thats exactly how we think about it mike so the average term of the cd portfolio is months right now the two specials that i mentioned that we have are months and months cds so very short the idea being there that its like you said its very competitive now but if rates start to come down midyear second half of next year then we have an opportunity to reprice as well or so thats exactly the strategy michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then just as you guys think about all the disruption in the industry i think one of the reasons at least in my opinion that you guys have weathered the storm so well is just the diversity of the franchise both line of business geographic you had some really large wellrespected players that are no longer around just strategically is there anything on your roadmap that might be new or pulled forward where theres opportunities maybe like on the private banking side or in some of these other small business niche businesses that these banks had large market share and that you guys are looking at that we should be mindful of as we think about and growth opportunities vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont think theres a specific business line from other banks that we would be interested in i mean we would have pursued that long ago weve always said that we were different we had been compared to those banks that are in our relative size range right at least to couple of years ago so they were peer in our peer group they were benchmarked against them by analysts i think their model was vastly different than what we do weve said that over time if you go back and look at the old earnings call transcripts ive said it over and over again we tend to focus on building relationships in the middle market handling consumers or kind of midstream consumers we do have a private banking effort we do have the physicians first program which is really focused on higher high income consumers but we cater fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 to the broad spectrum of consumer and small business and thats really thats been our focus we focused on investing in product capabilities to help us broaden the returns on capital that we deploy with consumers and businesses that doesnt sound like a very sexy model but weve tried to manage risk by diversifying geographically we said that repeatedly gary spends lots of time his team tom fisher gary the whole team analyzing concentrations of risk so that theres granularity within the portfolio and then i think if you go back and look at the earnings transcripts even before all this happened i said we are a very strong consumer franchise with a granular deposit base our deposit mix was very favorable and quite frankly i think that is really paramount to the valuation of a bank i think if youre going to evaluate the value of a financial institution you want to look at their deposit base so i think i dont see us really changing i do think with the exit they are in our businesses as well right so the exit of those players from a competitive perspective will help us and then i think from a wealth perspective doing loans to high net worth individuals commercial lending in certain markets we will be able to benefit from the disruption indiscernible vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania most opportunity is to pick up bankers too vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania absolutely hiring people weve had no issue attracting talent so actually people reach out to us all the time and thats not the way it was historically so i think our staying power and conservatism really puts us in a strong position thats what i said in my comments as we move through the cycle to compete more effectively we have liquidity capital capacity a great product set and i think from a i said it before and ill say it again i think that our investment in technology what were focusing on for us is spot on its improving the ability for clients to purchase multiple products and services through us in a very efficient way so we continue to focus on the estore and thats why the consumer applications are up as much as they are i think because we add deposits in november to that platform and thats really going to help us with getting new consumers that itll be really easy to purchase multiple products and services and open depository account on one platform with one application so thats the most exciting part i think as we move forward its using ai and the digital tools that we put in place to make it a better experience for the clients anyway thats it michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no thats its really helpful color thank you guys and then just last question from me i was just curious if you were willing to maybe share or opine some thoughts about the kind of the next phase of bank ma here vince i mean its pretty apparent that theres going to be some more consolidation on the heels of this event just curious what youre seeing out there it seems very slow and kind of regulatory headwinds at this current juncture but just also maybe a comment on what you think that next iteration of consolidation could mean for fnb from an opportunity standpoint if at all vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well ive said i made a comment on one of the calls that i wouldnt want to be an investment banker and everybody is ph running crazy with that at this point but im not going to make any sarcastic fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 comment but i will say it might be a good time in the future right to be an investment banker because there are a lot of banks that are struggling for a variety of reasons as we move through this cycle i think when we come out the other end there will be things to look at i dont think were there yet i think if we were to be active in ma and im not suggesting that we are were kind of internally focused right now we stick to the tried and true strategy of focusing on end market deals where we can get cost saves that are immediately accretive to earnings and have very limited tangible book value dilution and returns on capital that are well above our cost of capital thats our weve said that forever thats what the board expects but were very disciplined around that and i think it shows in our performance that weve stayed true to that strategy i think the current ma market is very challenging still theres a lot of banks that probably would like to sell themselves but i dont know that the deal works from a mathematical perspective or from a financial perspective so weve been focusing principally on building out our edelivery channel the estore that i mentioned and then augmenting that channel across our sevenstate footprint with the deployment of atms and itms so we feel that thats a better way for us to go in very costeffective effectively bridge our physical delivery channel with the atms branded atms and then push our digital products to that customer base and weve had some good success doing that so were going to stay focused on that de novo strategy and the deployment of atms and continue to drive consumers and small businesses then anyway thats my view on ma no sarcastic headlines so michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no i appreciate it its interesting time so your thoughts are helpful thank you guys for taking all my questions vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks mike vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator our next question comes from russell gunther from stephens please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys i wanted to follow up on comments that gary made earlier itd just be helpful if youre able to share some of the assumptions that went into the companywide stress test you performed this quarter sounds like thats something you do this time every year would be interesting to just get some kind of broad strokes around assumptions particularly cre price declines anything you guys could elaborate on gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its pretty much our normal stress test review russell from the assumption perspective from a result perspective chargeoffs came in a little lower than they did the past review and in terms of the economic forecast a little higher provision around the forecast in terms of the acl it covered those potential losses by fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 more than in a worst case ninequarter scenario so just the standard review which we do on a pretty regular basis and it came up better than we expected and better than the prior review russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thats helpful gary thank you and then just switching gears for my last question here on the securities portfolio just any appetite to restructure some of that and if so what type of earnback you guys might be willing to stomach vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no i would say i mean historically weve looked at that and its a zero sum game so we like the portfolio that we have the cash flows its pretty healthy level almost million over the next months about of the portfolio thats rolling off at and today were reinvesting in that kind of level so given the structure of the portfolio i think our team scott has done a very nice job creating the portfolio so you dont have significant extension risk or contraction risk and with where we are today the opportunity is there to cash flow every month i mean for the second quarter we reinvested about twothirds of the cash flows million or so into the portfolio the portfolio did shrink a little until weve some of the funds fund to loan growth that there but during the quarter we reinvested a today its last quarter first quarter it was so well continue to opportunistically invest there as we look ahead kind of the general plan will be to hold the portfolio about the same level as it was at the end of june as we go forward again being opportunistic with where we invest so far weve been able to put million to work at a threeyear duration so i think the strategy of the portfolio its a good sound portfolio and i think the strategy makes a lot of sense for us russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc yeah that make sense vince thank you very much for the color vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you operator our next question comes from manuel navas from da davidson please go ahead manuel navas q analyst da davidson co hey good morning just to kind of follow up on that can you give a little bit more color on where you stand with borrowings and kind of decision making and the process i know you had it laddered out a little bit and you gave kind of an update last quarter just kind of want to hear where you stand with borrowings today and with the cash on the balance sheet as well fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean as we sit here today we still have about a billion or what i would call excess cash we put that on in the march timeframe given the market disruption that occurred like i said that affected our net interest margin statistics that went down from kind of that march to april timeframe that i talked about with the dollars of nii kind of proposed to a push to that we talk about it regularly for now were going to keep it billion right scott manuel navas q analyst da davidson co okay if i jump back to loan growth for a bit it seems like the perspective is on the consumer side as purchase comes down and youre doing more gain on sale business the consumer growth might decline a bit across the back half of the year also on seasonality just kind of what are the trends there on an outlook and then what are you seeing right now commercially vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think you nailed it on the mortgage book i mean were expecting it to tail off a little bit towards the end of the year but i do think commercial is up the pipelines are up about across the board good activity in the carolinas a little slower than previous years but still good solid activity and this is where our geographic diversification really helps us right because i think the midatlantic has slowed dc and baltimore is a little slower pittsburgh is still pittsburgh is just chugging along cleveland and pittsburgh and then the south is still experiencing were experiencing elevated pipelines but like i said i think its a little slower than it has been in the past its substantial enough to provide us the opportunities to hit our guide and thats why we reaffirmed our guide for the year so as we were halfway through here so were feeling a little better right about where were going to end up vince vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania midsingle digit yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so anyway thats the kind of the look i think from a ci perspective theres probably a little more activity on the ci side obviously cre is a little slower yet were not a player in the large office space urban large office were not really a player there so what were seeing is a little different than others may have faced but thats where we are manuel navas q analyst da davidson co whats the current size of the physicians first portfolio and is there any updates possible on kind of success on crosssell or anything like that that you can share vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 yeah i dont have statistics at hand to share with you that portfolio continues to grow it was north of million in total i dont have the exact number in front of me but vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its around like a billion of physicians first mortgage vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thats globally im referencing what we originated in our program versus what we hold on our balance sheet but we hold on our balance sheet larger throughout vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats just vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible in the mortgage rate not just physicians and the physicians first program so the total portfolio would be billion originated through our specific program would be about million to million but i think the again i think were going to be focusing as we move forward on more saleable product so we should be able to bring balances down and those customers have weve really just started to scratch the surface in terms of how we go after crosssell opportunity so i dont have good statistics for you vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania were early on vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania were very early on particularly with the aggregation of those products in the estore and come november when we add the depository products whats going to happen is when somebody originates a mortgage loan even through the physicians first program theyre going to be able to purchase the insurance and depository and other consumer loans products on the same platform or at one time with one application insurance isnt going to come in for a little later but deposits and loans will be there endtoend by november vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah for physicians loans made this year i mean were talking about plus have multiple products out the door with us and so manuel navas q analyst da davidson co thats great and i guess my last question is as we see nii and given your rate assumptions that can change very quickly but given nii and nim guidance do we think that nii could bottom out like early next year what are kind of thoughts around that given that this is a little bit of a hypothetical for next year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i mean the margin and nii really bottom to kind of fourth to first quarter kind of based on our current forecast and what were thinking and then well start to build there obviously the earning asset growth that we have right is a key factor in there and helping to indiscernible but i would say over the kind of that fourth and first is based on what we see today like you said it can change quickly so thats kind of manuel navas q analyst da davidson co definitely vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania where we would see things kind of bottoming out manuel navas q analyst da davidson co thank you i appreciate the time vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator and our next question comes from brian martin from janney montgomery please go ahead brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott hey good morning guys most of my stuff was just answered there with the loans and the margin but just one more on the margin vince i guess theres the pace of indiscernible funding cost pressure is flowing slowing so that the rate impact of going forward to the margin should be less and less so if you are troughing in fourth quarter first quarter then the rate of decline in the margin should be maybe a bit more this quarter maybe a bit less in the fourth quarter and kind of tailing off is that how to think about it given your outlook on rates vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say i mean i mentioned the basis points a month the last couple of months so whats baked into our guidance would probably be in that i dont know three months to four months as we go forward really much slower pace than the basis points that it was down first and second quarter so thats whats baked into our guidance and then bottoming in that kind of fourth and first brian and then starting to slowly build from there fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania got you okay and then just on the on the liquidity part and just deposit growth in general i know you talked about maybe the noninterestbearing being a bit lower but just as far as the contraction and you talked about the seasonality this quarter and deposits whats your outlook on deposits here i mean if you maintain that liquidity is your expectation that those deposits with seasonality grow a bit this quarter i know you kind of give the guidance for the full year but just thinking about deposits in aggregate not just the noninterestbearing bucket vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i mean what we commented on is kind of flat from june to the end of the year just given the municipal deposits what the flow through there and i think our if you look at our data i mean all the peers arent out yet for our deposit decreases versus the ha data i think show very well and i think the noninterestbearing changes from some of the stuff ive read is is at the better end of things for sure in the prior quarter compared to those that are out so far so brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah okay and then just just on an outlook on the liquidity when you actually maybe look at using that to fund the loan growth as opposed to just holding it for a bit whats kind of the outlook on that liquidity vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah really just for now i mean were going to hold it brian where it is i mean were earning on it right scott brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania for basis points brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott thats right vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so its really not costing us to keep it and just given the environment we dont have a set date i asked that all the time were going to start to deploy it but for now were going to maintain that billion and like i said its from an nii standpoint its just not hurting us fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah got it okay and maybe just the last two was it sounds like with the loan growth the pipelines are up a bit but still kind of maybe tepid on the commercial side the buyback i guess is that something i guess this current level of type of repurchases could continue for the near term if youre the earnings are there and youre willing to take the capital maybe a bit lower if youve got the conservative credit quality at after the stress test is that fair how to think about the buyback going forward certainly expecting us to be opportunistic vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think thats the key word its really opportunistic and if the loan grows a little slower than whats in our forecast we think we could become more active from a capacity standpoint we still have plenty under our authorization the million of capacity authorized and still could be used brian so well continue to be opportunistic and we manage that we will align it with shareholder interests and well continue to do that brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott yeah okay and then and maybe just the last one i think gary you mentioned last quarter that you might after youve done the stress test that you might think about doing making some sales on selective sales on the office side i guess any update on that as you kind of gone through things any changes to your outlook there still potential that may occur gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania frank we dont have anything in our queue at the moment so really really nothing that is teed up for a later year sale its always part of our quiver that we have to take action so well continue to look at that as we move through the year and see if anything needs to be put into that category here before the end of the year but nothing right now brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott got you okay perfect i appreciate the update thanks for taking the questions vincent j calabrese jr a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you operator this concludes our
