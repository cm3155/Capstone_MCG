stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks mark good morning everyone slide provides an overview of huntingtons strategy to build the leading peoplefirst digitallypowered bank in the nation we continue to execute against the strategic vision and are pleased with our progress todate we see significant opportunities ahead of us as we position our businesses for the recovery at hand over the past year we updated our multiyear strategic plan with the focus on driving long term revenue growth continuing to build our brand based on bestinclass products and increasing our industry leading customer satisfaction across our businesses we also announced the planned acquisition of tcf financial which will provide a powerful opportunity to grow revenue expand our market presence and provide scale to our businesses while increasing our investments in digital and other areas this combination will increase our capacity to invest and we will become more efficient with the significant expected expense takeouts we accelerated our digital investments as part of our strategic vision and are encouraged by the digital adoption trends due to the investments weve already made for the first time over half of new customer deposit accounts were originated digitally in the last quarter the doubledigit growth in active digital and mobile engagement is similarly encouraging as we look ahead were optimistic about a strong economic recovery unemployment has decreased significantly across our footprint were again hearing a crescendo of commentary from our customers regarding labor constraints and wage inflation consumer confidence has meaningfully improved on average consumers are less leveraged and more liquid our debit card trends have consistently posted doubledigit yearoveryear growth rates for the past several quarters consumer spending in service industries is expected to broadly accelerate this year as demand returns consumer loan production also continues to be strong on the commercial side sentiment is encouraging our pipelines are up across the board increasing our confidence and recovery in commercial loan demand later this year while supply chain constraints such as the semiconductor shortages will likely challenge some manufacturers in the near term progress of recovery and visibility into growing customer orders are causing outlooks to strengthen let me also share some highlevel remarks on our first quarter results which provided a strong start to the year and included solid core performance with our momentum building commercial loan originations were in line with expectations however our overall growth was constrained by both forgiveness of ppp loans and continued headwinds in dealer floor plan and commercial line utilization both of which are temporary challenges residential mortgage auto and rv marine produced seasonally strong originations in face of tight inventory growth in consumer loan balances was obscured by unprecedented levels of paydowns following the two recent round of stimulus deposit growth continues to consistently exceed expectations finally on slide id like to get an update on the pending tcf acquisition we believe the timing could not be better as the strengthening recovery dovetails with the growth and scale opportunities presented by this combination we continue to make good progress toward our anticipated closing late in the second quarter and to complete the majority of system conversions late in the third quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 in march huntington and tcf shareholders approved the transaction and our integration plan is on track we completed the selection of key management and anticipate receiving the outstanding regulatory approvals including the required branch divestiture in the coming weeks weve begun major components of the cost reduction plan including the closure of meijer branches later this quarter now let me turn it over to zach for more details on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides the financial highlights for the first quarter we reported earnings per common share of return on average assets was and return on average tangible common equity was bottom line results were augmented by two notable items the first was a million marktomarket benefit on our interest rate caps driven by the steepening yield curve and increased market volatility the second was a million or reserve release resulting from the improving economic outlook and credit metrics partially offsetting these were million of tcf acquisitionrelated expenses which were broken out as a significant item in the earnings release with granularity provided in table now lets turn to slide to review our results in more detail we continue to be pleased with our sustained growth in pretax preprovision earnings which increased yearoveryear in the first quarter total revenue increased versus the yearago quarter net interest income grew driven by solid underlying loan growth and the 34basispoint increase in nim which were positively impacted by the substantial marktomarket gain that i mentioned in our interest rate cap derivatives and the million of accelerated ppp loan fee accretion fee income growth of was aided by a record first quarter for mortgage banking income as salable mortgage originations set its own record with yearoveryear growth and secondary marketing spreads remained elevated similarly our wealth and investment management businesses experienced its best quarter ever with respect to net asset flows and also benefited from positive equity market performance over the prior months card and payments continued to post strong consistent growth deposit service charges remained below the yearago level as elevated consumer deposit account balances continued to moderate the recovery of this line total expenses were higher by million or from the yearago quarter percentage points of this growth can be attributed to the approximately million of significant items related to the tcf acquisition there were also approximately million of expenses in the quarter or approximately percentage points of growth resulting from the pullforward of these three expenses that otherwise would have been incurred in the future the first of which was a billion contribution to the columbus foundation second we moved our annual longterm incentive grants to march from the historical timing in may third we retimed some expense related to our colleagues health savings accounts which would otherwise have been incurred in the balance of these two compensationrelated items together totaled approximately million the remaining approximately underlying expense growth rate was driven primarily by the accelerated investment and strategic growth initiatives which we have been communicating for the past several quarters turning to slide fte net interest income increased as earning asset growth was coupled with yearover year nim expansion on a linkedquarter basis net interest margin increased basis points to as shown in the reconciliation on the right side of this slide the linkedquarter increase primarily reflected the 49basispoint huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 net change in the interest rate caps as weve discussed previously were taking actions on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent margin pressure caused by the prolonged low interest rate environment managing the underlying core net interest margin near current levels given the significant impact on nim from the interest rate caps slide provides additional information on this aspect of our comprehensive hedging strategy as we disclosed in december we purchased billion of interest rate caps with an average tenure of seven years to reduce impacts on capital from rising rates this hedging action performed very well this quarter in march we subsequently sold billion of new interest rate caps at a higher strike price to create a collarlike position this is expected to dampen further marktomarket impacts and recover approximately half of the premium paid on the initial caps while maintaining the majority of the capital protection from the position turning to slide average earning assets increased billion or compared to the yearago quarter driven by the billion of ppp loans and the billion increase in deposits with the fed average commercial and industrial loans increased from the yearago quarter primarily reflecting the ppp loans on a linkedquarter basis ci loans decreased primarily reflecting the forgiveness of ppp loans and the decline in dealer floor plan utilization as we indicated at the rbc conference in march commercial loan pipelines remain up significantly from year ago and were seeing that manifest in new commercial loan production residential mortgage rv and marine all posted yearoveryear growth in new production average consumer loan balances declined sequentially as stimulusrelated paydowns more than offset strong new production in the quarter on a linkedquarter basis average earning asset growth primarily reflected the billion or increase in average securities as we executed our previously announced plans to deploy excess liquidity through the purchase of securities during the quarter turning to slide we will review deposit growth and funding average core deposits increased yearover year and sequentially driven by increased consumer liquidity levels related to the downturn consumer growth largely related to stimulus increased account production and reduced attrition slide provides an update on ppp forgiveness and expectations for the current program in total huntington approved billion of ppp loans in the original program and has approved an additional billion of loans in the current program in light of the recent congressional extension of the program and our current application activity we now anticipate the total amount for the current round to reach approximately billion we continue to expect approximately of those balances from the original program and the new program ultimately to be forgiven through the end of march billion of loans from the original tranche have been forgiven and we anticipate approximately billion will be forgiven during the second quarter for the current program we expect the majority of the forgiveness to occur this year particularly in the second half of the year slide illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios the tangible common equity ratio or tce ended the quarter at down basis points sequentially the common equity tier ratio or cet1 ended up the quarter at up basis points from the last quarter the cet1 ratio is modestly above our to operating guideline and we feel its prudent to maintain strong capital levels going into the tcf acquisition it also positions us well to execute on our growth initiatives and investment opportunities going forward as we have previously communicated weve paused share repurchases until we have substantially completed the tcf acquisition and integration huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 slide provides a walk of our allowance for credit losses the first quarter included a million reserve release primarily from consumer while the quarterend acl represents of loans and of loans excluding ppp we believe this is a prudent level to address remaining economic uncertainty while reflecting the improved overall credit metrics and economic outlook slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter our overall credit performance continued to strengthen net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases slightly below the lowend of our average through the cycle target range from to basis points our criticized asset and npa ratios were both relatively stable as always we have provide additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides i want to spend a minute on our ongoing investments and progress on digital engagement and origination looking at slide we continue to invest in a focused set of strategic initiatives to drive revenue acceleration and competitive differentiation in addition to a variety of digital and product investments we are adding personnel in core revenue generating roles to support strategic growth in our capital markets specialty banking small business administration and vehicle finance businesses weve also increased marketing spend back to pre pandemic levels and to promote new launches related to the fair play banking slide illustrates several key digital engagement and origination trends showing some of the benefits of our ongoing tech investments on the left side of the slide you can see continued growth in monthly digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking the digital origination trends on the right side of the slide are particularly encouraging as they show strong customer uptick of the new consumer and business digital origination capabilities we introduced over the course of the last year we are executing robust technology roadmaps across our business lines that will drive sustainable revenue momentum via improved customer acquisition retention and deepening finally slide provides our updated expectations for the full year on a huntington standalone basis we now expect fullyear average loan growth of to down slightly from prior expectations as a result of the elevated levels of paydowns and the delayed recovery of commercial and vehicle floor plan line utilization these expectations reflect flat to modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of ppp and lowsingledigit growth in consumer loans excluding ppp we would expect to see lowsingledigit growth in both for deposits we now expect fullyear average balance growth of to higher than previous expectations given the stronger than anticipated deposit inflows in the first quarter and the overall elevated levels of core deposits which we expect to persist for several more quarters were also adjusting our expectations for fullyear total revenue growth higher to a range of to we expect net interest income growth to be in the midsingle digits while noninterest income is expected to be modestly lower for the full year full year growth expectations for noninterest expense are now between and on a nongaap basis excluding million of significant items i discussed previously we expect noninterest expense to increase between and this increase relative to our prior expectations is driven by the foundation donation in the first quarter and increases in compensation expenses related to the higher revenue expectation for the year the large majority of the underlying expense growth continues to be driven by investments in our strategic growth initiatives as weve discussed previously while expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term our commitment to positive operating leverage remains over the long term our expectation and plan is to bring the expense growth rate back huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 to more normalized levels during the second half of finally credit remains fundamentally sound we now expect full year net chargeoffs to be between to basis points reflecting improving economic conditions and stable chargeoffs in both commercial and consumer portfolios further reserve releases remain dependent on the economic recovery and related credit performance as a reminder all expectations are standalone for huntington and do not include consideration made for the pending acquisition of tcf now let me turn it back to mark so we can get your questions mark a muth senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thank you zach daryl well now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first questions come from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions kenneth a zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you good morning mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc good morning ken kenneth a zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc why dont we start in just in terms of the interest rate caps i probably may not be the only one who didnt appreciate how meaningful this could be on a marktomarket basis for nii i get that you added the short cap position but it still seems that you are you have a fair amount of long exposure outstanding can you just talk about the volatility that we should expect sort of on a how long did this volatility last over time i mean is it right to assume that we could be looking at maybe not a millionplus swings but million million swings in nii in any given quarter up or down zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks ken this is zach ill take that question and i would start by saying the priority of our the goal for this position and our strategy here was to look around the corner to manage risk to protect capital and to be dynamic and proactive to do that and we thought it was a really smart move and as you saw it i think it benefited us substantially huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 and so that also underlies our decision to continue to maintain this position albeit somewhat collared as we discussed for the foreseeable future and so well have to see what happens these get marktomarket every day and ultimately we post the result thats extant at the very last day of the quarter but we believe its the right position as we go forward here so well have to see well keep you posted but over the long term we think its the a really smart position for us to protect our capital stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ken id just add when we executed these in the fourth quarter remember the outlook was that rates would be flat through well into so we thought the benefit of this capital protection would be in the out years four five six months and obviously interest rate outlook changed very rapidly after the election but it wasnt our intent to sort of view this as some kind of shortterm position when we originated it it was this protection of capital over time kenneth a zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it no it definitely worked out incredibly well this quarter no doubt about that my second sort of related followup question is a little more in the indiscernible zach there i think im missing something but would love your clarification on this if we look at just the change in net interest income from last quarter to this quarter and we back out only the change if the way i understand it the change in the caps of call it million to the positive and then we back out another million change in ppp income it implies that net interest income actually went down by million sort of on and all else equal basis am i missing something in that calculation zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no i think youve got it right i think we saw as we noted in the commentary a bit of pressure on underlying loans in the quarter just from headwinds were seeing in line utilization but that was offset by really strong fee income growth during the quarter the nim if you were to strip out that cap gained was to give you a sense of the net interest margin stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and ken you also had the impact of day count if youre looking at the dollars zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah on a sequential business correct kenneth a zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay all right perfect thank you very much operator thank you our next questions come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc good morning matt matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i know youve talked about it in the past here and there but as we think about the increased investment spend this year specifically on technology and digital i just wondered if you could summarize what are couple of the kind of bigger initiatives bigger spend is thats driving that higher investment spend this year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think this is zach ill take that and steve may want to tack on as well here but look what we really like about our strategic plan is its incredibly focused and its driven by key initiatives across each of our business lines so within our consumer business line which weve talked about for a while much of the increased investment is around digital with three major focus areas as weve talked about over the last several years and certain last year improving our digital point of sale and product origination capabilities we largely completed that last year and now the teams are working through how to best optimize and incorporate that within the omni channel client engagement process we have for client origination also a lot of focus around engagement and deepening to personalization and ease of use client account servicing in the commercial business significant amount of digital investment as well around new client onboarding relationship manager digital tool sets as well as focused investment in new people for example in specialty banking and in our capital markets business were also really pleased with the investments were putting into our wealth and investment management business which again is sort of mixture of both technology to improve the clientadvisor interaction experience and relationship management tools as well as select people hires as we bring on new relationship managers which is as i mentioned in my script really driving substantial sales growth and performance and lastly i would highlight vehicle finance for the last several years weve been working to digitize the customer experience as well as continue to expand the geographic footprint of that business in a way thats really constructive i dont know steve if you want to tack on to that matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats a very helpful summary as we think past the cost saves associated with the tcf deal youve mentioned longterm expense growth like what is a good call it three to fiveyear outlook on expense growth and i understand that might be somewhat revenuedependent but if you think about most revenue growth coming from loans nim expansion hopefully things that arent super high on the efficiency ratio what would a good range for underlying expense growth be huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a great question and i would note that for the next several years based on our forecast for the integration of the tcf acquisition overall reported revenue and expense growth levels will be substantially impacted by indiscernible quite high levels of growth in both as we incorporate that business and measure the yearoveryear growth but on the underlying basis which i know was the basis of your question my expectation and goal is that were growing the top line at or above nominal gdp with revenue lower than that and driving positive operating leverage i think over the long term something like to sort of inflationary growth is logical and if revenue is stronger then perhaps expenses are stronger than that but generally thats my broad expectation stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ken sic matt just want to reiterate the commitment to positive operating leverage after nine years we would let this year to make investments coming off the strategic plan and in particular because of the economic volatility that we saw last year with the virus and the expected recovery we think we are playing this in terms of timing exactly right weve got a series of nearterm revenue growth initiatives that were executing and that will position us for the long term but we will be back to positive operating leverage matthew d oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks matt operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your questions kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning just one followup on the expense side so clearly you have the access revenues helped by the swaps and then a higher expected growth rate this year on the expenses which makes sense that youre continuing to accelerate but just zach you mentioned last quarter a different cadence between first half expense growth and second half expense growth i just want to try to understand is the increment thats embedded in the new expense growth rate also going to show all in the first half in part due to the items in the first just kind of if you can walk us through how things project from here would be helpful thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah ken thanks for the question i appreciate the chance to clarify yeah i would say approximately three quarters of the incremental expenses were what we saw come through in q1 so theres a small lift in the balance of the year but most of it was what we saw come through in q4 and q1 and the key thing with our plan is that as were frontloading these investments into the first half of the and so the expectation is really the huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 same as it was before elevated expense growth on a kind of core run rate basis in the first half coming down to more normal levels in the second half of the year and of that to underlying core expense approximately percentage points of that is our longterm strategic investments and the other to is really sort of a natural expense inflation that you might expect and some normalization of companywide programs like ph merit and te and medical costs and things of this nature and some additional expenses to support the additional revenue as i noted in my prepared remarks so front endloaded back end back to historical levels and really no change other than those factors that we just talked about kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc helpful and then the same kind of just a thought process on the nii side obviously nii outlook helped by the million just underneath that can you just talk about just the underlying changes to your prior views on how nii versus the fees look as well thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah overall expect midsingle digits in net interest income for the full year i think driven by in part by our modest growth in assets that weve indicated in the guidance between and and the spread nim spread overall thatll be roughly flat for the full year i think just touching on nim for a second next couple of quarters will likely be in the mid2 in terms of nim biggest impact just changing our expectations somewhat is continued elevated levels of fed cash driven by the elevated levels of liquidity across the system that many folks have commented on here in the earnings cycle and to some degree the beginning of the rolloff of our hedges which will be down about basis points into q2 so q2 will be the trough to mid2 for the next several quarters but pulling up fy still looks like a nim of or better and long term still forecasting to maintain those levels and stable to rising nim over the longer term kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator thank you our next questions come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc good morning scott huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey just wanted to ask a followup on the rate caps so between the what you sort of capped in the first quarter then the sale of the billion of new caps in march so does this do anything to your sort of your forward rate sensitivity i think zach ive sort of thought about the hedges as more balance sheet protection than really adjusting your rate sensitivity so is there any change to that dynamic zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc so i think you got it right the position was around protecting capital and i think you saw on the slide offset of the oci mark on securities was protected by this so its really good weve got our treasurer derek meyer in the room why dont derek you comment a little bit on asset sensitivity and your outlook for that over the future derek meyer a executive vice president corporate treasurer huntington bancshares inc yeah thank you so weve continued to look at that obviously we already stated this was primary thinking of a capital play there is a knockon effect because it comes to earnings on our margin most of our decisions have been to retain as much downside protection or capturing the upside as these rates have gone up and that is these caps have obviously made us even more sensitive in that respect we are evaluating our next hedging moves to protect that downside without giving up that upside opportunity so it does change the posture thats also a big part of what were thinking about as we evaluate our positioning with tcf which is a separate set of decisions but that is another set of levers that we have to incorporate into our forward view zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc broadly speaking just pulling back a second i really like where the asset sensitivity kind of strategy and trend is going in that over time as our existing hedge position slowly rolls off we will become more and more exposed to what will be likely a gradually increasing interest rate environment as well and so i think its sort of welltimed for us to be exposed in that way as rates begin to rise over the next several years r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got it thats helpful thank you and then i guess as a followup i think zach at a point youd mentioned the sale of the new rate caps the billion that should sort of dampen the new marktomarket impacts is there a way to sort of speak to how much protection you have against future volatility like we saw this quarter both up and down huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its a good question we estimate its between and impact on dampening so important we wanted to maintain kind of a net long exposure there because we do think to the extent that there is a probability of moves substantially off the forward curve which is likely to be higher but that dampening is between and as we go forward r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got it all right thank you guys very much appreciate it zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome operator thank you our next questions come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your questions peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i was wondering if could you talk about you mentioned the loan pipelines are very strong im just wondering can you talk about what youre hearing from your customers about making investments and versus kind of the appetite to draw down on lines of credit versus using that excess liquidity and maybe delaying line drawdowns stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc peter this is steve so in the last four or five weeks ive had about ceos in small meeting virtual conversations and the outlook by them is virtually in all very positive about this year pipelines their backlogs very very encouraging and their overall economic outlook for the next couple of years is also very positive they have in a number of situations have supply chain constraints some of it from mundane items some of it for chips but theres a curtailment that i think is being experienced at least in part by these companies on the supply chain universally they talk about inability to get adequate labor very high turnover and clear wage inflation at the low end a consequence of that will be more investment by many of them into automation all the way through including packaging so we expect therell be a fair amount of equipment finance activity this year and when be combine with tcf well have a indiscernible largest equipment finance company in the country that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 should position us very well we have a very good technology finance team that will play well with automation on the factory side but even in the healthcare healthcare products side were seeing a strong uptick healthcare systems are doing better and been able to reopen and sustain activity that was diminished during the peak of the virus so we the people were talking to the ceos in that arena generally very very confident going forward so we think the strong pipelines were seeing were up about of the commercial pipeline yearoveryear is reflective of what will be demand as we go through the year probably more in the second half than first but this will be in part because many of them had very good years have liquidity and theyre using that liquidity as opposed to outlying utilizations and other things inventories are low in many of these companies and some of its supply chain but some of its in significant demand inflation on the commodity side wood or lumber just a whole host of areas where theres cost push and i think that will in general further borrowing as their liquidity gets soaked up so were from these conversations were optimistic about the continuing improvement especially seen in the second half peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks steve and then if i can ask just a followup on the ppp you gave some pretty good disclosure on slide but whats the outlook zach for the rest of the year to net interest income from ppp zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think as we said the expectation is that well see a very substantial amount of additional forgiveness in the second quarter and i think to give you a sense q1 revenue in total from ppp was around million of which million was the kind of accelerated and million was the underlying yield my expectation for q2 is around million total revenue of which million basically half and half between yield and accelerating the acceleration and that will represent the preponderance of the ppp revenues for the first program well see a little bit of a tail as we go into the balance of the year the round two i mentioned is around billion about we think weve forgiven much of it in thatll add around billion of indiscernible and million of revenue we estimate to the year i know we have well have an analyst modeling call after this and well probably doubleclick into more of the details during that but those were the right highlevel comments for you now peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc welcome thanks operator thank you our next questions come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your questions huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning steve and zach some investors have expressed concern around the risk that internal combustion engine vehicles will lose value compared to electronic vehicles as they take over and obviously theres debate around when thats going to happen but can you speak to how hban is thinking about this risk what you guys are doing about it and the extent to which you expect to play a role in helping consumers fund q3 ev purchases as well as like from the standpoint of risk of declining collateral values for your existing book if you could comment on that as well stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so bill its steve a good question thank you we think its going to be an extended transition here i believe the industry is of that belief as well because ev is building in the country but its building at a very slow rate now that may accelerate with climate posture of the biden administration and for other reasons including consumer awareness around environmental and change in demand but combustion engines we think are going to be here through the decade in terms of demand and substantially there if not fully through production having said that in terms of the impact on us were a superprime lender so whether its a combustion engine or a hybrid or ev we work with a view of very low default rates and so marginal loss rates might increase a bit and probably would anyway because were at record highs in terms of global values for use so but we dont see it as a big event in terms of opportunity for us its one of the areas of environmentally sensitive financing that were looking at therere a series of other areas where were actively engaged and extending credit in the over time as we look back in the billions of dollars and there may be an opportunity for us to do something unique with the hybrids or evs as we go forward bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful and as a followup steve can you give a bit more color on some of the things youre doing ahead of the tcf closing just to make sure you hit the ground running next year is most of the initial focus on ensuring smooth integration versus maybe is it just too early to be thinking about the revenue synergy opportunity that is down the road or is that in the mix as well any color around that would be helpful stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so when we announced we talked about expense synergies and were fairly definitive but we also alluded to revenue synergies to start with our offerings both consumer and business are much more extensive than tcf so it sets up a crosssell something weve been working on and we refer to it as optimal customer relationships so weve been doing this for a decade we have very good experience with crosssell into the firstmerit customer base and we expect it to do as good or even better based on the learnings and experiences and the relative position tcf also outsourced a number of businesses or products which we manage directly and so well expect lift out of those so theres a variety of revenue initiatives which we are pursuing and in some cases weve already activated such as sba lending in minneapolis an activity that tcf didnt have and so as we go forward well expect these revenue initiatives and well share them in a future point will be significant upside to what weve presented in a summary level so well detail where we expect to get them as we proceed but first order of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 business is to execute the committed expense takeout and to get the synergies on that front that we expected with the closing expected later this quarter and a conversion late in the third quarter bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks bill operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steve alexopoulos of jpmorgan please proceed with your questions janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is janet lee on for steve alexopoulos just digging deeper into your commercial loan growth guidance i understand that in your guidance of commercial loans being flat to modestly higher for what is your assumption around the level of commercial utilization for your ci customers as compared to the current level and could you also provide more color around like how that compares to prepandemic levels zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure thanks janet for the questions this is zach ill take it overall as i mentioned in the comments the expectation is excluding ppp lowsingledigit growth in commercial loans and approximately percentage of that is from some modest line utilization overall the expectation for line utilization is it has been reset and ill come back in a minute and speak more specifically about the prepandemic comparisons you asked but just generally characterizing the expectation what weve seen is relatively flat in general middlemarket lines my baseline expectation is a modest improvement likewise what weve seen on the vehicle floor plan side is actually some retrenchment from the end of last year to where we stand now as we go forward were expecting some modest improvement in both of those together those represent just under asset growth expectation with my total asset growth but even if you were to normalize it i think the level of strong production weve got across both consumer and commercial we do expect to drive accelerated loan growth overall in that basis as we go forward just doubleclicking into the line utilization expectations prepandemic we were running in the middlemarket line utilizations sort of low40 and right now were in the high30 to give you a sense its been roughly flat now for several months in a row and i would expect it will be flat for a time before it starts to rise later in the year i think as has been wellpublicized elevated levels of liquidity across the system are contributing to our clients just not meeting those lines at this point but everything were hearing from them is that ultimately they expect to huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 go back to a more typical financing posture that those will start to slowly normalize probably more in the back half late and continuing into on the vehicle floor plan side the historical levels are sort of just around line utilization by the end of the year we had gotten to almost to be precise in december by the end of this quarter order of to give you a sense so it just continues to tick down and its ticked down even a little bit more into april so well have to see that one is really driven by the pointspecific auto manufacturer issues that have been very welldocumented in the popular press around microchip shortages and other component shortages everything were hearing though is that slowly but surely that they are chipping away at that issue the manufacturers and that vehicles will begin to flow at a faster rate in the back half of the year my general expectations are relatively flat in that for the next several months before it starts to normalize and rise more again towards the very late part of with the longerterm expectation based on our client discussions that theyll go back to historical levels of utilizing that financing but probably well into the middle of based on the supply janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats very helpful thank you and just turning to i want to talk through the new money yields at what yields new purchase securities are being put out to the book versus whats rolling off and same for new loan production and also whats your plan around deploying excess cash and how much of that could be deployed into securities over the next several quarters thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah ill take the first crack at this and then derek meyer our treasurer is in the room as well and may tackon as we go on the securities side we feel really good actually about where the yields are and what we were able to deploy with the roughly billion of net add during the quarter came on sort of around the 160basispoint level as we think about other new money yields generally some modest pressure but not overly so i think in the commercial business around point lower as we went into q1 from q4 cre likewise around to basis points lower auto roughly stable so were seeing some modest downdrafts on new money but not overly material i would say at this point most of the program impacts have been brought into the pricing as we take a step back and think about the posture on elevated liquidity i would say that as weve continued to update our forecast weve ratcheted it higher the expectation for elevated levels of liquidity and deposits as is indicated by our deposit guidance and likewise ratcheted out in time the duration that this phenomenon will last until it begins to normalize so likely itll take several more quarters for that to slowly start to weigh in and itll go all the way into so that gives us the cause to really look at the best ways to deploy that over time youve seen us optimize our funding structure and well continue to look for opportunities to do that to bring down funding costs using that but i think as well looking at whether its appropriate over time to invest in incremental securities is also part of the discussion to be clear liquidity is the primary objective in making sure that were managing that well and so well leg into and step into kind of phased basis any incremental moves on that and still working through it nothing for us specifically to talk about there but well continue to be dynamic in looking at it and just watching those trends and optimizing anything derek you would tackon to what i said huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 derek meyer a executive vice president corporate treasurer huntington bancshares inc no i think youve covered it we have reached the point with our va yield security strategy where the new money yields sort of equals to our runoff yields plus or minus so a lot of whats going to happen with prepayment speeds and then with the yield curve shape is i dont see a big change in trajectory janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you good question operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc most of its been handled but can you steve can you talk a little bit about retention and synergies that you saw on a firstmerit and also touch on like you gave the branches that youre closing what kind of retention you get from those and how youre thinking about tcf in terms of retention as well stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we have a set of opportunities thanks jon good morning im sorry we have a set of opportunities with tcf that are substantial in terms of retaining customers if we think about michigan for example even after our consolidations of branches and in aggregate therell be more than branches affected by consolidation and divestiture we will still have number one branch share in michigan by a factor of about so well be quite a bit larger than the next bank with physical distribution so that provides an enormous set of opportunities for us in terms of retention and we have had very high retention coming out of firstmerit and other instore branch consolidations huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 remember we consolidate about of franchise every year on average and so our retention efforts where we decide to drop remaining atms outreach we have a process we call white glove treatment thats been well defined over the years and developed combination of those activities the uniqueness of the product set while they deposited 24hour grade safety zone things like that also give us a distinct retention advantage so we expect to have very high retention by the tcf side of the consumer and on the business side again better products more capabilities as we go forward but it starts with winning minds and hearts of our soon to be new colleagues and were actively working that we would expect that would be successful as it was with firstmerit that will set up then this retention of customers through the conversion and beyond and the product menu just being substantially different much much bigger and better in many respects will be to the benefit of the customer base both consumers small and mediumsized businesses so were very very optimistic on the specialty finance side their equipment finance and ours is almost hand in glove but the combination will be extraordinarily effective and they have a great team we think we do as well and this hand in glove will give us opportunities to further grow that business were excited about their inventory finance business got some great people in these business lines as well as in the company generally and were going to be a stronger company as a consequence of the combination so very bullish about the expectations both on retention and revenue synergies as we go forward and well get the expense synergies largely complete this year jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you thats very helpful zach can you touch on mortgage expectations for the second quarter i know its kind of a mixed bag but looks like originations were pretty flat what kind of thoughts do you have for the next quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah we have q2 right in front of us its just broadly still thinking mortgage just continue to beat expectations frankly and be very robust i think the overall for the full year expecting revenues to be down between and on a yearoveryear basis just off of the total pace that represented but most of that growth or challenge really occurs in the second half of the year volumes continue to be very very robust and i think if you just talk in industry level youve probably seen even mortgage bankers associations rationing higher to volume expectations for the year i think if theres something that were watching carefully is the salable spread and that continues to be elevated above historical levels but it could move quickly so well see but so far continues to be holding up relatively well also so thats the expectations that weve got jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thank you guys appreciate it mark a muth a senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks jon operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the
