call over to bill william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan good morning everybody i imagine you have seen that earlier this week we completed our conversion of bbva usa i got to say im really proud of the team and our ability to sign close and convert billion banking institution within a year the dedication of our employees and our sustained investments in technology allowed us to convert roughly employees million customers and nearly branches across states bbva usa is now integrated into pnc and its customers can bank with us from coasttocoast were bringing our technology talent and the full suite of best in class products and services to of the nations largest markets with attractive growth opportunities as you hear me talk about for years to come now while we still have some more work to do which is to be expected for a bank conversion of this size were making solid progress with our staffing levels and the branch operations in bbva usa legacy markets in addition were encouraged to see the teams ph build pipelines and importantly growing new clients now with bbva legacy employees now on pnc systems we believe our momentum is going to continue to accelerate as we audio gap previously were following the same game plan that weve used in previous acquisitions and we know what to do we just have to execute on it with respect to our third quarter results we had a solid quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth which included record fee income in our pnc legacy businesses and continued improvements in credit quality similar to the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 last quarter and pretty much as expected we had a lot of moving parts in our reported results and of course rob will take you through those in a few minutes loan growth continues to be impacted by supply chain issues and the continued runoff of ppp loans and also the strategic repositioning of the bbva portfolios which is consistent with our acquisition projections that said total pnc legacy loans if we back out the ppp runoff actually grew almost billion with growth in both commercial and consumer categories and while the environment is still challenging were actually pretty encouraged by what were seeing on the corporate side with spot utilization rates stabilizing and even rising a little on the back of strong new originations in our secured lending and corporate banking businesses and on the consumer side were also seeing promising origination activity particularly in the residential real estate business importantly and as you see our balance sheet remains very strong and were well positioned with substantial capital and liquidity to continue to support our expanded customer base while making strategic investments in our technology and businesses another exciting development this quarter was the announcement of our integration with akoya data access network this is through an application programming interface the integration is going to allow millions of our customers if they choose to do so to safely share their financial information with fintechs and data aggregators its an important step in our efforts to help our customers protect their data while also giving them the choice to share their data with thirdparty applications similar to low cash mode this integration positions us as a leader in technology and innovation and enables us to best serve our customers and id like to close just by thanking our employees throughout the newly combined franchise for all their hard work which enabled this conversion our significant collaboration across all divisions is impressive and it gives me great confidence that well capitalize on the enormous opportunities ahead of us and with that im going to turn it over to rob for a closer look at our results and then well take your questions robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone as bill just mentioned and notable during the third quarter we converted the bbva usa franchise to the pnc platform in less than months following the announcement of the deal pncs increased scale from this acquisition underscores the opportunity we have with the bbva usa franchise we have a proven track record of acquiring attractive strategic opportunities identifying and reducing inherent risks and successfully growing franchises to deliver enhanced shareholder value and as bill just mentioned were well on our way to accomplishing this with bbva usa due to the june closing of the acquisition our average balance sheet growth for the third quarter reflected the full quarter impact of the acquisition as loans grew billion securities increased billion and deposits grew billion for comparative purposes to the second quarter which youll recall included just one month of bbva usa results our balance sheet on slide is presented on a spot basis total spot loans declined billion or linked quarter excluding the impact of ppp forgiveness loans grew and ill cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides investment securities declined approximately million or as we slowed purchase activity throughout much of the quarter during the relatively unattractive rate environment the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 our cash balances at the federal reserve continued to grow and ended the third quarter at billion on the liability side deposit balances were billion at september and declined billion reflecting the repositioning of certain bbva usa portfolios we ended the quarter with a tangible book value of per share and an estimated cet1 ratio of both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated at the time of the deal announcement during the quarter we returned capital to shareholders with common dividends of million and share repurchases of million given our strong capital ratios we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward slide shows our loans in more detail average loans increased billion linked quarter to billion reflecting the full quarter impact of the acquisition taking a closer look at the linked quarter change in our spot balances total loans declined billion the pnc legacy portfolio excluding ppp loans grew by billion or with growth in both commercial and consumer loans pnc legacy commercial loans grew billion driven by growth within corporate banking and assetbased lending this growth in balances has been aided by a slight uptick in spot utilization and while still near historic lows utilization did reach its highest level since december growth in pncs legacy consumer loans linked quarter was driven by higher residential real estate balances within the bbva usa portfolio loans declined billion primarily due to intentional runoff relating to the overlapping exposures in nonstrategic loans looking ahead we have approximately billion of additional bbva usa loans that we intend to let roll off over the next few years which is in line with our acquisition assumptions finally ppp loans declined billion due to forgiveness activity and as of september billion of ppp loans remain on our balance sheet moving to slide average deposits of billion increased billion compared to the second quarter driven by the acquisition on the right you can see total period end deposits were billion at september a decline of billion or linked quarter inside of this pnc legacy deposits increased billion as deposits continue to grow reflecting the strong liquidity position of our customers bbva usa deposits declined approximately billion during the third quarter which was anticipated as we rationalized the rate paid on certain acquired commercial deposit portfolios and exited several noncore depositrelated businesses overall our rate paid on interestbearing deposits is now basis points basis point decline linked quarter slide details the change in our period end securities and federal reserve balances and as most of you know we have been disciplined in deploying our excess liquidity with rates at historically low levels back at the beginning of the year as the yield curve steepened we accelerated our rate of purchasing activity however towards the end of the second quarter we deliberately slowed our purchases as yields declined with the increase in rates at the end of the third quarter we resumed our increased levels of purchasing including billion of forwardsettling securities which will be reflected in the fourth quarter average security balances now represent approximately of interestearning assets and we still expect to be in the range of approximately to by yearend as you can see on slide our third quarter income statement includes the full quarter impact of the acquisition reported eps was which included pretax integration costs of million excluding integration costs adjusted eps was third quarter revenue was up compared with the second quarter reflecting the acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth expenses increased million or linked quarter including million of integration expenses and two additional months of bbva usa operating expenses the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 legacy pnc expenses increased million or virtually all of which was driven by higher fee business activity pretax preprovision earnings excluding integration costs were billion an audio gap or the provision recapture of million was primarily driven by improved credit quality and changes in portfolio composition and our effective tax rate was for the full year we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately as a result total net income was billion in the third quarter now lets discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail turning to slide these charts illustrate our diversified business mix in total revenue of billion increased million linked quarter net interest income of billion was up million or reflecting the full quarter benefit of the earning asset balances acquired from bbva usa inside of that interest income on loans increased million or while investment securities income declined million indiscernible driven by elevated premium amortization on the acquired bbva usa portfolio net interest margin of was down basis points driven primarily by lower security yields importantly in the fourth quarter we expect premium amortization to decline meaningfully and the yield on the securities portfolio to increase third quarter fee income of billion increased million or linked quarter bbva usa contributed fee income of million an increase of million linked quarter driven by two additional months of operating results legacy pnc fees grew by million linked quarter or driven by higher corporate service fees related to record ma advisory activity as well as growth in residential mortgage revenue other noninterest income of million decreased million linked quarter as higher private equity revenue was more than offset by the impact of million negative visa derivative adjustments this adjustment relates to the extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution turning to slide our third quarter expenses were up by million or linked quarter the increase was primarily driven by the impact of higher bbva usas expenses of million and higher integration expenses of million pnc legacy expenses increased million or due to higher incentive compensation commensurate with a strong performance in our fee businesses including a record quarter in ma advisory fees our efficiency ratio adjusted for integration costs was obviously with the acquisition our expense base is now higher but nevertheless we remain disciplined around our expense management and as weve stated previously we have a goal to reduce pnc standalone expenses by million in through our continuous improvement program and were on track to achieve our fullyear target additionally were confident well realize the full million in net expense savings off of our forecast of bbva usas expense base and expect virtually all of the actions that drive the million of savings to be completed by the end of we still expect to incur integration costs of approximately million related to the acquisition since the announcement of the acquisition weve incurred approximately half of these integration costs and as bill mentioned we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track and to achieve these goals our credit metrics are presented on slide and reflect strong credit performance nonperforming loans of billion decreased million or compared to june and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies of billion at september increased million or however this increase includes approximately million of operational delays in earlystage delinquencies primarily related to bbva usa the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 acquired loans subsequent to quarter end all of these operational delinquencies have been or are in the process of being resolved excluding these total delinquencies would have increased million or net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million a decline of million linked quarter the second quarter included million of chargeoffs related to bbva usa loans mostly the result of required purchase accounting treatment for the acquisition our annualized net chargeoff loans in the third quarter was basis points and during the third quarter our allowance for credit losses declined million primarily driven by improvement in credit quality as well as changes in portfolio composition at quarter end our reserves were billion representing of loans in summary pnc reported a strong third quarter and notably earlier this week converted the bbva usa franchise with this step completed we expect to add significant value to our shareholders as we continue to realize the potential of the combined company in regard to our view of the overall economy after somewhat slower growth during the third quarter of due in part to the delta variant and supply chain problems we expect gdp to accelerate to above annualized in the fourth quarter we also expect the fed funds rate to remain near zero for the remainder of the year looking at the fourth quarter of compared to the recent third quarter results we expect average loan balances excluding ppp to be up modestly we expect nii to be up modestly on a percentage basis we expect fee income to be down between and mostly reflecting the elevated third quarter ma activity we expect other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities and visa activity on a audio gap we expect total noninterest expense to be down between and excluding integration expense which we approximate to be million during the fourth quarter and we expect fourth quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of dave george with baird please go ahead with your question david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc hey guys good morning i had a question on robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning dave david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc good morning rob on loans so you said on the bbva theres an additional billion of declines to come can you kind of give us a sense with respect to the timing and how you see that portfolio running off and then ive got a followup robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure yeah again good morning dave so of the billion that weve identified going forward that we intend to runoff billion of that we expect to runoff in the fourth quarter and thats part of our guidance the remainder likely over the next couple of years david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc great thanks for that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc in terms of kind of the legacy pnc ci businesses obviously it was encouraging to see a little bit of kind of organic growth in the third quarter can you give us a sense and this may be difficult but clearly supply chain is weighing on working capital needs and im curious if you can contrast the growth and commitments relative to the growth in outstandings in commercial im just kind of curious how the commercial business is doing with respect to adding new names and new commitments and were obviously not seeing the benefit of that at least today in terms of outstandings because of that inventory issue william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 hi its bill weve been for the last couple of quarters our new money commitments have been i think maybe at record levels rob but increasing each quarter and so new business new clients in some cases just upsizing what we already had and the ph audio gap we had a little bit in utilization but most of this was kind of new client growth robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc great robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and as you know dave like weve mentioned utilization ticked up a little bit still at historic lows but a little bit and that was part of it too david alan george q analyst robert w baird co inc sounds good guys thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next question is from the line of john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc morning john william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the loan growth topic that tickup in utilization and then also the new clients that you mentioned could you give us a little more detail on what areas and what business areas which industries that youre starting to see that momentum start to build the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah theyre kind of related i mean the growth in our secured lending areas sort of stood out and they traditionally have higher utilization so in some ways it was an increase in the overall average because we grew the book with the highest individual average rate but even in the straight middlemarket corporate book it finally stabilized and i guess went up a couple basis points there robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc just a little bit william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah so basically business credit or assetbased lending group and corporate banking john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay and then on the expense side just wondered if you could talk a little bit about wage inflation if youre starting to see any signs of that in your franchise and also if so is there any risk to how were thinking about the merger cost or the million in net cost saves thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc with respect to wage inflation you might have seen an announcement that we increased our base rate to at least an hour and beyond that in some cases in certain markets so its robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc an hour william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah sorry and its so that is real but that was kind of already assumed in our financial assumptions it doesnt have anything to do with our assumed cost saves but theres real pressure there and the only way through time to kind of offset that pressure is through increased automation and just frankly controlling overall head count john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay so fair to say the longerterm impact on how you view the longterm efficiency ratio for the bank the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc too early to tell right were on this so average wages per employee are going to go up at issue is how quickly we how we scale our franchise through automation so we become larger without more employees and thats played out for a period of time here john if you just go through our financial statements even going back for five years we just need to continue that trend to be able to continue our pursuit on positive operating leverage robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and to offset what is real in terms of wage pressure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah got it all right thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question rob was hoping to drill into the expense dynamics a little more so your fees excellent this quarter those will come down but still appear to remain very strong as it relates to the kind of the related cost outlook how much of your expense guide contemplates sort of ongoing costs related to that strong fee momentum and then can you maybe sort of size up how the million in bbva related cost savings fit into the fourth quarter guidance in other words how much starts to come next quarter or it comes next quarter and then how much is into still robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure so thats a lot there scott but the easy answer to that is thats all in the guidance for the fourth quarter so we to your point fee businesses have been they were good in the third quarter theyve been good all year across the board asset management consumer services corporate services particularly in the third quarter as well as residential mortgage and with the exception of the elevated levels of ma activity and corporate services we see all of that continuing into the fourth quarter and thats part of the guide so therell be expenses that are obviously associated with that in terms of the million in savings we are achieving savings presently we got some in the third quarter well get some more in the fourth quarter thats part of the guide but the bulk of the savings will be in the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 so reaffirming the million in savings a portion of which well recognize in and then of course going forward into all in our guidance r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then you touched on this in your prepared remarks but that elevated premium amortization at bbva that weighed on the consolidated companys securities portfolio yield can you just expand upon that a little please william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it was painful in its simplest form right we marked that securities book when we closed the deal robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc june william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah at really low rates that then continued through in fact rallied through the quarter so the prepay rates on their cmos increased we had so you think about it we mark a book to whatever the yield was its at a premium all of that prepays because of the low rates hopefully we expect that to abate as rates have now kind of gone back up but we marked them as premium securities and then got caught by the robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and it was a function of the timing of the acquisition william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and setting up those securities as premium security william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc in its simplest form what we did if you think about it is it knocked down goodwill in the way when we marked a book because we had a highervalued asset so it took in effect took in income upfront robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and we pay for it a little bit this quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean rob the securities yield why dont you the guide on the like that book yielded basis points or something robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc that happens yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and its and we expect going forward the total book to increase robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right which is what i said in my comments thats right r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah im glad to hear that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc its behind us and it is acquisitionrelated william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc that was painful r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co exactly all right well perfect i appreciate the color operator thank you our next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead with your question the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey i know weve had a lot of expense discussions already but im just looking at what youve done so far in the quarter when i look at your detail around the run rate of expenses at bbva in the one month there that you had and the three months three full months that you had in it already looks like youve brought down expenses a bit and im just trying to understand what youve done so far and whats left from here because youve already executed a bit it seems to me am i missing something there robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well no no youre right youre right hey betsy this is rob youre right we started as we said we would so we have begun to realize expense savings pretty much across all the categories but were just getting started so what you see in that audio gap we still have work to go betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then when im thinking about the pace of that expense save from here part of its a function of the conversion the lift and shift obviously but then can you talk us through what comes after the lift and shift in terms of expense saves trajectory william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont even know what to talk about robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc why dont you talk about the activities indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc line items i mean we have betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc no like branch closures and what the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc really the question is ph its this william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc some of its branch closures some of it will be in the form of people who have stayed with us through conversion on stay bonuses therell be shut down of systems and vendor contracts and all sorts of different things that will roll through dependent on time some of which we leave around for a bit as sort of back up for not notwithstanding the fact weve converted well leave some stuff up and running for a little bit of time just for the in case robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i think thats right and probably at least in terms of the pickup in the fourth quarter activity we will as a mix we will pickup more vendor savings weve already started that well start to pick those up but at an accelerated rate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc again i guess the question really is lift and shift as a percentage of total cost saves is like round numbers william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its the wrong way to think about it the fact that we get that done at one point in time allows us to then aggressively move costs right because legacy system shutdown legacy vendor shutdown related people who are supporting old applications all of that stuff now starts rolling through the system betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah yeah and my point is its not the one and done its a portion of the total expense save that youll be generating william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah look at the end of the day the guidance is the guidance right were going to get some more in the fourth quarter and then were going to get it all next year robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc were on track we will get it all we know the line items where it will come from robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc i just think i think the way to think about it betsy is its sequential so the conversion and the lift and shift clears the deck so to speak to get started sooner rather than later on realizing those savings betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi gerard william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us youve mentioned a few times within the corporate services numbers that the advisory business i think you said in the press release it was at record levels but rob in your guidance you expect it to come down other than the obvious pipeline that you guys see in your book can you share with us what else your guys on the front lines are seeing about ma is it just that theres just not as much as many companies that are left to do ma going into william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc no look in its simplest form you set a record you assume you wont keep setting records theres nothing out there that suggests necessarily that its going to weaken from here by the way inside of that we obviously we have harris williams but we also had breakout quarters for solebury and sixpoint and related advisers robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and if the market continues then well continue to have great fee income out of it but its hard to keep saying were going to budget a record upon a record i think its as simple as that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and what does it represent now of corporate services or what did it represent in the third quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well yeah no i know that the lets say ill do a quick math in my head william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay and then a question on the loantodeposit ratio you and your peers of course have incredible amounts of liquidity and that ratio has come down looks like the fed now is going to enter into a tapering phase and clearly theyll still be adding to the deposits of the banking system until tapering is over how are you guys looking at and i know theres a lot of moving parts with loan growth and maybe some deposit shrinkage but when you look out over the end of and into bbva is fully integrated what do you think is an optimal loantodeposit ratio for you folks and when do you think you could get there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc theres too many variables gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean its if you go back in history right people would operate i dont know where we were or something the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc and that was kind of a liquidity safety function so if you were short liquidity at that point youd raise wholesale liquidity to kind of keep your ratio at that point today were so flush with reserves into the system wholesale funding is next to zero and until the fed forget about tapering actually shrinks its balance sheet thats not going to change now loan growth even accelerated and exaggerated loan growth will absorb some of that but i think youre going to see loantodeposit ratios low for a long period of time and therefore i think youre going to see security balances as a percentage of a balance sheet and weve already talked about this increase across the industry and i thats going to i think its going to take years to play out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate the color thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator thank you our next question is from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead with your question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hi mike robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc no good deed goes unpunished so since you from announcement to conversion under months its probably a record why arent you increasing your million cost savings but more generally having completed the lift and shift conversion over the weekend what parts of your technology do you think are further validated whether the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 its your use of the cloud or data lakes or something digital that youre doing that you think others havent advanced as far as you have william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well look with the first question at the end of the day were always in the business of figuring out how to become more efficient think of the million as line items we know we can get we actually know where theyre coming from and when theyre going to show up so youre right at the margin well find some other stuff by the way well probably find some stuff we need to invest in too so we just we put that into our guidance we say look well get the million well talk to you about when we get closer but we havent lost focus on the primary objective robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well and the million you know that mike the million was estimated off the expectation that wed convert and when we did so we didnt convert sooner than we thought we did it on time william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but that was a number that how to say this a visual ph till we can see it we know the line items its very precise the technology look it worked we had at the margin some confusion with retail clients on password resets and some other things but the basic technology moving it over turning it on it all worked which is just phenomenal effort by our team and validates the investment weve made over the years i dont know what people have or dont have in terms of their ability to do that but the biggest element for us mike and i think weve talked to you about this was in effect this data lake idea where since our applications dont hold their own data they call from a central lake and theyre linked through api and theyre cloudnative it just makes it very easy to move data and you onboard a new client its not much different than as if we just got a couple million new clients overnight that and i make it sound very easy and all my technologists are ripping their hair off right now but thats what we did and it worked and the investment in that was everything from the data lake to cloudnative to api and everything and frankly to having businesses and technology audio gap so technology at pnc is not in the back office somewhere doing its job theyre actually sidebyside in agile teams working with their business partners to develop product and importantly to execute the conversion which we did that cultural element is probably as important or more important than all the rest mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so just in the final look at this how many apps did you eventually keep from them or how much in gigabytes did it add or just one more time what you added william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well we ended i think we ended up keeping two or something the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph it was the last number i said about that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah one was the business transfer the personal foreign currency transfer business i dont know what the other one was and thats kind of it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and that was and i just want to make sure i have the numbers right was that out of and you have or something like that and i mean william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible we went through that before and i cant remember them off the top of my head but they had twice the number that we have that feels roughly robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible they had more than william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc they had we run the whole bank on robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc a little more than william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah a little more yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah why was that i mean thats the number that stands out theyre so much smaller yet they had twice as many apps just how do we get that stake william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i dont we dont know yes i mean i think once you start using apibased programs its almost kind of a click and drag right you dont have to recreate functionality across multiple applications you can simply bring in whatever functionality you need from a library of api the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 so lets say you had an application that just needs a checking account balance rather than you write a full application that goes and finds a checking account balance off your core ledger we just have an api you drag in and produce it i think thats a big part of it its also credit to the team way back when we did national city we moved everything onto single applications right a lot of times and bbva might have done this youll do an acquisition you just keep too many applications alive because you dont want to choose between one or between the two of them mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator thank you our next question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead with your question john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning guys robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research ppp dynamics are confusing to all of us and i just wanted to ask a little bit about that so rob on the outlook i think its helpful that you give the core loan growth and it excludes ppp but maybe you could give us a sense of what you expect for ppp payoffs in the fourth quarter and then beyond and then also on the nii is ppp included in that and what kind of ppp contribution have you had to nii like this quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research what happens to that going forward robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 yeah in simple terms john and youre right it is confusing but simply put we expect ppp to be down on average about billion in the fourth quarter in the third quarter net interest income contribution from ppp was about million and we expect that to go down approximately million to million and that is in our guidance our nii guidance john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah okay got you great another cleanup question here on the securities redeployment of cash into securities to is the target for this year over time and this gets into the discussion that you had with gerard about loan to deposits but could that go higher over time if loan growth doesnt surface as much as we think william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think it could i think that depends audio gap opportunity set where the yield curve is and how we think about longterm risk i mean part of the issue today john is you have this longtail risk maybe its not such a long tail that you end up with a spike in long rates because inflation becomes real which causes you at the margin to be slower than you otherwise might be in deploying that cash i think as that risk normalizes if we dont see loan growth youll see balances increase john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay thanks guys william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc following up on gerards question as we look ahead to fed tapering and eventually rate hikes how are you thinking about deposit betas relative to when we exited the last ph reserve cycle the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i think theyre going to be a lot lower simply because theres so much cash sloshing around remember even when the fed tapers theyre not necessarily shrinking and so with the cash in the system the competition for deposits just wont be as great as it once was so i think at the margin theyve got to be lower robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and another way of answering that with all the deposits we have were not thinking a lot about betas right bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc right no that makes sense understood thats helpful and i guess going back to the momentum youre seeing in new money commitments whats your sense from your discussions with your customers of the extent to which utilization rates are going to remain relatively depressed as long as the supply chain problems that were seeing remain unresolved versus the potential for continued improvement even if the supply chain problems were to extend well into next year say just trying to get a feel for how big that how much of an impact thats having william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it varies across industries i mean they i shouldnt say without question but the vast majority of our clients talk about the need and desire to build inventory and do more capex which is why some of the lines have been increasing their ability to execute on that is somewhat dependent on supply chain and it depends what industry youre in if youre dependent on chips for your manufacture its a struggle other businesses are not and could build immediately and maybe were already seeing the benefit of that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and if i switch to bbva and the revenue synergy opportunities when you think about those how do you how does your confidence level around the timing and magnitude of realizing those differ relative to what you saw in rbc i mean it seems like you guys have the playbook but just trying to get a sense for differences that you may see in execution this time around robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey bill its rob in terms of contrasting with rbc just set that aside in terms of the bbva were very confident in terms of the numbers as bill mentioned that weve laid out and the plans to get there its probably on the increment better than rbc just because its bigger we know what we do its very familiar audio gap of course rbc was successful but this is this is more of magnitude william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean mike would say mike lyons who runs the cib business would say its as much as perhaps a year faster and he gets there largely because the teams are in place much faster than we had them in place with rbc and well see how that plays out but were hitting the ground faster in terms of teams who are out calling on clients the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 and then we also have a book of business with bbva that is better than what we had with rbc so the ability to upsell that book of business on the fee side youll remember i was talking about just their percentage of fees to total revenue being very low so we have an opportunity for fee momentum early on we have teams in place and we ought to be able to grow clients a little bit faster than what we saw on rbc just because were on the ground already robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats the revenue aspect so the revenue aspect of it is significantly higher than rbc the expense side i thought was the question the magnitude that i mentioned is the answer bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats really helpful if i could squeeze in one last quick one bill youve talked about having teams inside of pnc studying crypto and love to hear your thoughts on a couple of areas first is there a revenue opportunity for pnc as youve taken a poster look at it and then second from a risk perspective how concerned are you about the risk of disruption from decentralized finance william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so what we talked about or what we are contemplating offering we literally have built today to our clients and look our clients are interested in it as an ability for them to trade crypto in a safe fashion through mobile app at pnc i dont have to opine on whether i think thats a good investment or not a bad investment which we know with certainty that we have to of our clients who are moving money into and out of crypto exchanges so theyre interested in it and our surveys confirm that the financial disruption of crypto broadly and probably inside of that stablecoin is a real threat and it depends on how that plays out through time theres the risk i think that people are aware of with certain of the stablecoins having lets call it suspicious collateral behind them but there is also the risk through time that a substantial portion of savings either domestic savings or even emerging market savings get absorbed into a stablecoin and out of the traditional money transmission system and that would affect the economy and the ability to control the money supply long term and i think thats what well i know thats what the various regulatory bodies are looking at to figure out how to get their arms around but thats independent of whether we let our clients trade bitcoin robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right right bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah but there is a revenue opportunity from that portion of it even by simply just providing the service to them and so is that a fair conclusion the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure i mean at the margin yeah bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc at the margin robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc dont see it as a big driver bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc right right got it thats super helpful thank you again for taking my questions robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator thank you our next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning guys can i come back rob on the premium amortization question im just wondering if you can help us understand in the securities yield like what either the basis point impact was or if you even have a total dollars of premium am for the company and what you expect that to look like going forward robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well thats all in our guidance in terms of the dollar amounts but id say if you took a look at it in terms of the yields you can see the decline in yields if it wasnt for the elevated premium amortization expense we would be close to down a little bit from those second quarter levels ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thats fair and my second question is what are you seeing just on core front bookback book relative to these forward settlings and just what youre seeing in the market today and where you can get your hands on the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well its looking better is what we said relative to the indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the yields were buying at today but we expect the yield on the total book to increase pretty substantially next quarter largely because of a decrease in the amortization cost robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats right ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yep and then lastly just purchase accounting accretion you said it was million in the second quarter do you have anything in the third and just how do you expect that to look like too robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc de minimis in the third and going into the fourth quarter which is a good thing ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yep okay great thanks operator thank you our next question is from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc bill you mentioned at an industry event last month that california was an underperforming franchise i believe at legacy bbva us what are your thoughts on turning that around is it build is it buy or is it just internally or to improve the franchise the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its building it i mean it was underperforming largely because they didnt have the products and services to cover the corporate opportunity thats in california and by the way that opportunity is massive so the big effort for us and were fairly far along in the process is to get feet on the ground on the corporate side who can cover clients and in some cases bring relationships with them so we dont need to buy anything at the margin we might rearrange some of the branches there but the real opportunity set in california is to get corporate bankers and tm coverage and capital markets players on the ground in california robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which in many instances weve ph done already in that terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then just as a followup question could you maybe talk about the rollout of low cash mode is that allowing you to play more offense or is that more defense and then is that with the million to million the decline in overdraft fees is that still the right way to think about the impact of that product on fees thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so the rollout has been somewhat seamless and of course we just with the conversion of bbva we put all of their customers or enabled that low cash mode on all of the products who converted over i forget the current stats but its millions and millions and millions of alerts that have gone out its millions of people who have been able to transfer money before they get hit with a charge its people being able to choose the order at which ph they want to pay a bill and return items with no return fee and look in some ways we kind of led the industry into this discussion and youve seen how people have reacted part of our lead was in what we charge customers but a big part of our lead was on technology and simply empowering customers and most everyone who has followed is kind of doing it through brute force and just cutting fees as opposed to offering different solutions which is the most important thing about low cash mode i think so were happy with what its doing its knocked our complaint volume into the care center down by i dont know what the number is on overdraft over or something indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah on overdraft even higher than that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so its done exactly what we thought it would do terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 operator thank you our next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning it seems like the loan portfolio at bbva usa will be mostly derisked or runoff by the end of ph with just a couple billion left the next few years is there an opportunity to kind of fill that bucket kind of relatively quickly i guess what im getting at is maybe you can take down bigger holds because youre a bigger company versus legacy pnc or just some lowhanging fruit to fill some of that loan runoff between this quarter and next william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its embedded in our guidance i mean you got to appreciate matt were not if loans are up or down by billion were not going to putty over the organic result by doing something we otherwise wouldnt do it will follow its ordinary flow well grow clients we are a larger company so we can take larger holds if we want to utilization will hopefully go up and as we always do were sensitive to risk and they have some books of business that are both in some cases riskier than wed like to be in and in other cases they just have no cross sell opportunity and so the return on the equity you deploy to hold those loans is just really low robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but i would add matt i mean obviously ph central premise is acquisition these are growth markets so we would expect through time to generate aboveaverage growth not necessarily in the next days william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but thats obviously a big opportunity for us matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay yeah and i wasnt so much looking for just the fourth quarter i guess i was just thinking like the next few quarters do you get outsized loan growth given indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc if we get a tailwind at all youre definitely going to see that and i think and most importantly if you go back and look at our loan growth through the period of rbc so kind of twoplus years after we did rbc we started to really accelerate in corporate loan growth and everybody said how are you doing that and its all new customers and new markets and we fully expect that were going to be able to do that in all of these new markets that we just the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 developed admittedly with some noise in the front because were going to runoff a little bit out of bbva and outright loan growth is as weve seen fairly tepid at the moment matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question is a followup from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi thank you for taking the followup question bill you guys mentioned about raising the entrylevel wage or minimum wage for your folks some of your peers have done the same bank of montreal raised their wages last week and bank of americas got that in program so the question is this can you share with us what it means for the people right above the entrylevel worker meaning like a branch manager how far up does that ripple go in terms of the inflation on wages because of the minimum wage going up william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it goes straight up through the pay grades i mean most of the cost is actually in the compression as opposed to the initial jump for the people who are at the lowest level so part of the work set to go through it is to figure out in fact how you move people up who are today at but tomorrow if the went to the person goes to or so and im making up numbers here but thats the majority of the cost and by the way its the majority of the work set to get right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good okay no i appreciate it thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah operator thank you our next question is a followup from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi could you put a ribbon around your expectations for loan growth that seems to be like the big question going into the quarter and in the past you mentioned over half your commercial clients are private companies which dont have the same access to capital markets and therefore they might come back first so just one final thought on loan growth when do you think we get the big burst of loan growth is it a quarter away is it three quarters away is it a year away what do you think and why the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well mike i think you asked me this nine months ago and i said i can wish and hope for it but im not sure i can predict it any better than the next guy what were seeing for the first time right is not just the new money going out the door which weve been growing clients and growing committed money but were starting to see that move in utilization and if that is foreshadowing what happens into the fourth quarter into next year then were going to have really accelerated loan growth if we bounce around where we are then its going to be somewhat muted and by the way thats kind of what you see in our guidance mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible its kind of youre asking me to go out and say hey supply chain is going to be fixed and loan growth is going to rip and i hope it does but im not the expert to answer that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay well maybe just specific numbers on the utilization a little bit more you said its at the highest level since early last year or so but whats the normal level of utilization what was the level and where is it now william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its still what points robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc if you go were at 49ish and we had sort of normalization william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so were at least points off and were probably points off the peak in march of last year so theres a lot of room here yeah operator thank you there are no further questions william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc all right well thank you everybody look forward to talking to you in the fourth quarter thanks robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 thank you operator this
