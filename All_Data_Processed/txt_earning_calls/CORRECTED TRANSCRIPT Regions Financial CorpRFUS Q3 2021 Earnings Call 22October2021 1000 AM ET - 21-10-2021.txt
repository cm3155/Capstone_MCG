morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today were very pleased with our performance this quarter as we achieved earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of adjusted pretax preprovision income increased sequentially and we generated yeartodate positive operating leverage our ability to keep the momentum going and deliver solid third quarter results comes from three primary factors first we continue to benefit from our growing footprint unemployment levels are improving and in most of our markets are well below the national level people and businesses are continuing to move into our 15state footprint and that bodes well for our growth prospects for the remainder of the year and into well continue to make strategic investments in core and growth markets where we can grow new customers and deepen existing relationships on that note were also pleased to share that yeartodate net account growth has exceeded account growth has exceeded account growth for the preceding three years combined second credit quality has demonstrated incredible resiliency and continues to exceed our expectations businesses across all industries have found ways to adapt and prosper despite ongoing supply chain and labor issues and consumers continue to cautiously manage their finances overall we feel very good about the health of our business and consumer customers third we continue to take advantage of opportunities to invest in talent technology and capabilities to support growth for instance earlier this month we closed our acquisition of enerbank a leading home improvement pointofsale lender a key part of our strategy to serve as a premier lender to homeowners we also entered into an agreement to acquire sabal capital partners sabal has a strong reputation and proprietary technology platform that will expand our real estate capital markets capabilities once the transition is complete we expect to be a top five bank agency producer regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 the enerbank and sabal acquisitions complement our existing portfolio price and capabilities in the consumer and corporate bank we will continue to evaluate prudent nonbank ma opportunities that will allow us to expand our products and services and enhance our relevancy with our customers also we recently launched our bank oncertified now checking account this new product has all the benefits of a traditional checking account without the concern of overdraft fees and finally our investments in digital and data are positioning us for growth through a technologyenabled seamless experience in branches and across all platforms customers are responding to the personalized service advice and guidance they receive from regions today more than twothirds of our customer transactions are digital further over the last two years active mobile banking users were up and notably zelle transactions have more than tripled we feel really good about our progress and momentum we operate in some of the best markets in the country have a solid strategic plan an outstanding team and the experience to compete effectively we focus every day on delivering products and services that are valued by our customers while continuing to support our communities and provide an appropriate return to our shareholders now david will provide you with some details regarding the quarter david jackson turner chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet adjusted average and ending loans increased approximately during the quarter although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity pipelines have surpassed prepandemic levels in addition production remains strong with line of credit commitments increasing billion yeartodate consumer loans reflected another strong quarter of mortgage production accompanied by modest growth in credit card however consumer loans remain negatively impacted by exit portfolios and further paydowns in home equity overall we continue to expect full year adjusted average loan balances to be down by low single digits compared to although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by lowsingle digits with respect to loan guidance we are not including any impacts from our enerbank acquisition which closed on october and resulted in the addition of billion in loan balances that will benefit the fourth quarter and beyond so lets turn to deposits although the pace of deposit growth has slowed balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels the increase is primarily due to higher account balances however as john mentioned we are also producing strong new account growth we are continuing to analyze probable future deposit behavior and based on analysis of pandemicrelated deposit inflow characteristics we currently believe approximately or billion to billion of deposit increases can be used to support longerterm growth through the rate cycle additional portions of the deposit increases could persist on the balance sheet but are likely to be more ratesensitive lets shift to net interest income and margin pandemicrelated items continue to impact net interest income and margin net interest income from ppp loans decreased million from the prior quarter but is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter cash averaged billion during the quarter and when combined with ppp reduced third quarter reported margin by basis points excluding excess cash and ppp net interest income grew regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 almost linked quarter and our adjusted margin was essentially stable at this reflects strengthening loan growth as well as active balance sheet management efforts despite a nearzero shortterm rate environment similar to prior quarters the impact on nii from historically low longterm interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies lower deposit cost and higher hedging income during the third quarter we repositioned an additional billion of receivefixed swaps we shorten the maturities from to late the repositioning locked in the associated gains that will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swaps and will allow for more nii expansion when rates are projected to increase further with the inclusion of enerbanks fixed rate loan portfolio less hedges will be needed to protect nii and the net interest margin profile from falling rates the cumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately billion roughly of that amount has either been recognized or is locked into future earnings from hedge terminations reflecting the dynamic management of our hedging strategy excluding enerbank and ppp adjusted net interest income should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter after excluding the nonrecurring interest recovery in the third quarter including ppp and the enerbank acquisition linked quarter net interest income is expected to grow between and in the fourth quarter as illustrated on the slide over a longer horizon a strengthening economy the ability to benefit from higher rates and organic and strategic balance sheet growth are expected to ultimately drive net interest income growth now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income increased from the prior quarter primarily attributable to strong capital markets activity including record loan syndication revenue and solid ma advisory fees we expect capital markets to remain strong in the fourth quarter generating revenue in the million to million range excluding the impact of cva and dva well provide more specificity regarding expectations in january other noninterest income also increased during the quarter due to an increase in the value of certain equity investments as well as increased gains associated with the sale of certain small dollar equipment loans and leases mortgage income decreased quarteroverquarter primarily due to mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments partially offset by improved secondary market gains service charges remained relatively stable compared to the prior quarter but we continue to expect they will remain to below prepandemic levels we attribute the decline to changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices including transaction posting order card and atm fees remained stable compared to the second quarter debit and credit card spend remain above prepandemic levels as we continue to benefit from elevated account growth and increased economic activity in our footprint given the timing of interest rate declines in and excluding the fourth quarter benefit from our enerbank acquisition we expect adjusted total revenue to be up modestly compared to the prior year but this will ultimately be dependent on the timing and amount of ppp loan forgiveness lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses increased in the quarter as higher salary and benefits and professional and legal fees were offset by a decline in marketing expenses salaries and benefits increased primarily due to higher variablebased compensation associated with elevated fee income as well as one additional day in the third quarter associate head count also increased by positions during the regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 quarter with the vast majority of those within revenueproducing businesses further exceptional performance particularly in credit is also contributing to higher incentive compensation we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business excluding approximately million of core run rate expenses associated with our fourth quarter enerbank acquisition we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be up modestly compared to and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time from an asset quality standpoint we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter as overall credit continues to perform better than expected reflecting continued broadbased improvement across virtually all portfolios and continued recoveries associated with strong collateral asset values annualized net chargeoffs decreased basis points during the quarter to basis points representing the companys lowest level on record post our merger of equals in addition to lower chargeoffs nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans also improved while total delinquencies remained unchanged during the quarter our allowance for credit losses declined basis points to of total loans and of total nonaccrual loans excluding ppp loans our allowance for credit losses was the decline in the allowance reflects betterthanexpected credit trends and the continued constructive outlook on the economy the allowance reduction resulted in a million benefit to the provision future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of chargeoffs greater certainty with respect to the resolution of remaining risk to credit losses as well as the integration of enerbank yeartodate net chargeoffs are basis points and we expect fullyear net chargeoffs to approximate that same level which includes the impact of enerbank and excludes the benefits of any future recoveries that may occur with respect to capital our common equity tier ratio increased approximately basis points to an estimated this quarter as previously noted we continue to prioritize the utilization of our capital for organic growth and nonbank acquisitions like enerbank and sabal that propel future growth beyond that we use share repurchases to manage our capital levels share repurchases were temporarily paused ahead of the enerbank closing which absorbed approximately billion of capital in the fourth quarter we anticipate being back in the repurchase market this quarter and expect to manage common equity tier to the midpoint of our to operating range by yearend so wrapping up on the next slide our expectations which weve already addressed in summary we are very pleased with our third quarter results and are poised for growth as the economic recovery continues pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are wellcontrolled credit quality is outperforming expectations capital and liquidity are solid and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is from peter winter of wedbush securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i wanted to ask about the loan growth and i was wondering if you could just talk about where the loan growth is coming from on the commercial side and is it more a function of the new account growth that youre seeing john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so id say a couple things and first of all we are beginning to see a little improvement in line utilization line utilization was up basis points in the quarter and that trend is continuing through the first couple of weeks of the fourth quarter production is up to levels consistent with prepandemic levels so essentially two times what we were experiencing about a year ago commitments are up by over billion and thats largely the result of new relationships that were adding resulting from disruption in markets that were operating in and talent weve been able to acquire growth is occurring in some of our specialized industry businesses transportation healthcare financial services technology and defense are all generating and finding new opportunities and our pipelines are again back at prepandemic levels and two times essentially what they were about a year ago so good activity despite labor shortages supply chain issues constraining the economy a bit our markets are doing well our customers have a positive outlook on the economy and the future and as a result we are beginning to experience some loan growth and feel good about the prospects for peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thats helpful can i wanted to ask about deposit betas in your asset sensitivity model can you just talk about what youre assuming for deposit betas today versus how that compares to last time the fed was raising rates david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well peter this is david so our deposit betas would have been kind of through the cycle last time kind of upper range maybe a little above that and right now what were trying to gauge is the surge deposits we had some billion to billion of surge deposits where we said of those we think can be put to work the other is likely to either run off or come at a much higher cost regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 when you think about the of surge deposits that beta is going to be substantially higher than our core we would peg that closer to on that component part but just remember when in the last rate cycle we were one of the lowest deposit betas and thats the value of our franchise lowcost low volatile deposit side and were looking to extract value out of as we get a more normal rate environment peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it okay thanks for taking my questions john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator thank you your next question is from ken usdin of jefferies john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning guys david i just wanted to ask you to expand a little bit more on your just how youre thinking about that longterm repositioning i saw in the deck that youve now locked in or realized and so theres always a back and forth here between keeping that income and positioning for higher rates so as you think forward and as we get closer to hopeful rates going up what do you where do you want to be positioned at that point in terms of the asset sensitivity profile david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well so our goal is never really to take a lot of interest rate risk and try to win because weve taken big bets were trying to gauge where we think rates are going to be obviously in we anticipated rates declining we put on our forward starting swaps to protect us in the down rate as we get more confidence that the economy can reopen and that the fed is likely to raise rates we want to take some of that protection off which weve done and thats what the repositioning of the billion did today we have about billion of notional protection receive fixed swaps in particular we have some others in floors but for the most part theyre in swap form and that protection goes through where we start gauging the fact that theres a little bit more probability of rates starting to rise towards the end of and we want to participate in that rate environment so our slide on page was trying to demonstrate how we hand off from the protection that we have in the low rate environment to let the rates carry us up as the swaps either terminate on their own or because we terminated them as we did with the billion we locked in that gain and well enjoy that benefit through the remainder of the swap period ken usdin q analyst jefferies company regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 yeah great that was good that is a good new slide and just on enerbank to that point about it can you just help us understand like what you think the originations could be as you look forward to the next couple of years like what the pace of origination could look like i know its going to depend on the environment but it seems like you can definitely continue to take share as you build that book up david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp sure so as weve discussed before that industry is about billion industry annual production each year very fragmented enerbank had represented about of that or call it billion of production i think the top five players in the industry account for right at of the industry so its a theres a great opportunity for us to really leverage their technology and we think we can grow that faster than they did but right now were looking at at least having that kind of production of billion on top of that if you look at the yield on the portfolio today you didnt ask this question but ill add to it just so you understand everybody understands that the yield on that is right at call it because of the we had to mark that billion book to market so we dont get the fee thats paid by the dealer which is deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over time our new production on the other hand will get that and so youre looking at going from a to yield on the new production if we could start growing that just a little bit faster than they have were going to this is going to be a nice growth engine for us and thats what we try to depict a bit on slide ken usdin q analyst jefferies company perfect thanks david john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from jennifer demba of truist securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning thanks so a question for you on one of the slides you have a comparison of your loan growth over the last several years versus your peers which is substantially below your peers i wanted to know where you want to have it are you happy with the level of loan growth that you produced over those years or would you like it to be a little stronger while still maintaining lower loan losses david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 yeah so youre referring to slide jennifer this is david and no we arent interested in being second to slowest growing on as depicted on the page what were trying to demonstrate is we had a shift strategically several years ago to focus on improving our riskadjusted return on capital because we think thats what shareholders wanted weve gone from second to last in terms of return on tangible common equity well see where we finish but itll be four number four or five this year and so its worked and weve reduced our risk profile dramatically over time so weve exited businesses so an example would be our auto businesses weve gotten out of loanonly relationships that didnt give us the full relationship value that we need and want and where we werent being paid for the risks that we were taking in things like real estate so we did weve had this massive shift and weve worked through virtually all of that theres always areas to prune but were ready to leverage our markets were in fabulous markets that we think are going to grow faster than most every part of the country and so as we the economy continues to reopen we have the liquidity and the capital to put to work and we much rather do that by our stock back and so i think were looking to improve our loan growth quite substantially relative to what you see on page john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah and i would just add i mean i think weve been pretty consistent to say that we expect over time assuming that were not working through exit portfolios and other things to grow at the rate of the economy as the economy grows plus a modest amount given the competitive position we have in a lot of markets that we operate in we ought to get a little more than our fair share but i dont expect us to grow at an outsized rate relative to the economy over time there will be periods of time when we can but in general we want to grow with the economy indiscernible and manage our business and a sound profitable way that produces consistent sustainable and resilient outcomes for our shareholders jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay second question is on capital markets you said its going to be probably million to million in fourth quarter what do you think the revenue opportunity for that business is for regions over time i mean what inning are you in terms of growing the business line john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well it continues to evolve if you go back to when we began to emphasize the importance of capital markets and began to acquire and develop capabilities to serve our customers it really was making very very modest almost nominal contribution to the company and thats obviously changed over the last seven years as weve continued to make investments in the business weve acquired talent new capabilities weve acquired businesses and well continue to do that i dont know that theres an upward limit on what the contribution can be were certainly very satisfied with the results weve achieved todate weve announced earlier this year that weve been approved for a freddie license to go with our fannie dus license the acquisition of sabal which is a feebased generating business brings with it additional hud capabilities smallbalance fannie and freddie capabilities to enhance our ability to generate placement revenue regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 were looking at other opportunities within capital markets to make acquisitions so were going to continue to make investments there we know that our customers have needs and we want to make sure that we have the capability to meet those needs and i would expect that that capital markets contribution to noninterest revenue and to the overall profitability of the company will continue to grow over time i dont see a particular upward limit on that jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator your next question is from dave rochester of compass point john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i just wanted to hit capital real quick i mean it sounds like youre poised for a pretty sizable buyback this quarter if youre going to wrap up the year at cet1 of so i just wanted to confirm that thats what youre seeing and if you could give a rough range around what that could look like from a dollar perspective thatd be great david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well so were at on common equity tier just to remind you were going to use about billion of that in the purchase of enerbank which closed october so david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thats a percentage point so now youre at now you have to put your mind on what were going to earn back ph out to regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp dividend and thats the capital we have left to either a invest john talked about sabal capital partners as a place to use some of that capital we have other nonbank things were working on and we are going to prioritize investments in those nonbank acquisitions before our share repurchase that being said our goal is to be at by yearend so if we dont get a particular deal closed during the quarter then well buy our stock back because we think is an optimum level for our risk profile that we have in the company david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay appreciate that and then maybe just switching to the liquidity strategy it sounds like youve got a lot of momentum on the loan growth front so some of this will obviously go towards funding that but you still have what seems like a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet so i was just wondering if you could talk about how the backup in interest rates that weve seen recently may have impacted how youre thinking about growing that security flows if at all and where youre seeing reinvestment rates today on what youre buying david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so i would ph grant you weve gotten a better position today than we did at the end of last quarter but sitting today or at least right now at ph we would had hoped that would be closer to before we started to redeploy some of that excess cash because youre just not being paid appropriately for the duration right now so our securities the cash flows we put to work today are going on at a ph spot and theyre coming off at about ph to we acknowledge we have a lot of cash we just right now want to be patient because we think there if were patient enough theres going to be a better opportunity to put that cash to work what we dont want to do is stretch trying to make a shortterm gain and really get ourselves in a pickle because were upside down in the trade and thats just not who we are so being patient i think is our best game right now david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay maybe one just one last one on the funding side i know you guys have already made a lot of headway on reducing the highrate borrowings you have i was just wondering if you see any other opportunities worth mentioning to do that over david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp we really dont we challenge ourselves all the time and one never knows i mean this is when you have a volatile rate environment things opportunities can present themselves as we did last i mean this quarter where we took some expensive debt out we dont really see that opportunity right now but well keep an eye on it and if theres a trade there that makes sense for us wed do it regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc all right great thanks guys david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning okay i have a really basic question around just the loan sales that you did i think in the quarter and i know that a lot of what youre investing is in driving future loan growth so i was a little surprised to see that maybe if you could give me some color as to what youre doing there david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah betsy its i wouldnt get too and this was not that large there were some loans that were certainly sitting in ascentium capital that didnt really meet our risk profile that didnt just wasnt the type of credit we really wanted to have we had a pretty good bid we tapped the bid we made million so it wasnt all that dramatic but thats why we did it if we see things from time to time that we want to offload from a credit risk management standpoint well do it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and so the followup here is regarding the underlying growth that you see exppp in the ci and the cre book and we know about the supply chain constraints and all of that but we see some nice growth in some of the services businesses maybe you could give us a sense as to where theres an opportunity to deliver on accelerating loan growth as this ppp rolls off or is this current level of nonppp in ci cre likely just go sideways from here just any color there would be helpful john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp no i think we expect expansion betsy i mean were again weve seen an increase in unfunded commitments customers who are contemplating either expanding their business making investments other things that would result in growth and loan growth across multiple industries similarly historically were going to run in about a rate of line utilization we ended the quarter just below and were as i said earlier beginning we are continuing to see a little bit of increase through the start of the fourth quarter so our expectation is that we will experience loan growth across our books of business in the wholesale business in as labor becomes more available supply chain issues begin to work themselves out and customers can put additional capital to work regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then when you think about the consumer side of the book whats your audio gap on that john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp we also think theres a lot of opportunity there and we talked about enerbank and our focus on lending around the homeowner we hadnt talked a lot about strategically why thats important to us but we know that homeowners maintain higher on average deposit balances they use more financial services which result in homeowners providing to more revenuegenerating opportunities because they have more basic financial needs and so our focus on mortgage on heloc and on pointofsale lending to the homeowner we think is a really important strategic initiative we see enerbank in particular as an opportunity to grow our consumer lending business also expect some expansion in card and related to other activities we have we think that consumer business will grow again in and beyond betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks indiscernible david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp hey betsy this is david i need to clean up one of my i told you the gain on sale was million that number should be closer to million so i just want to make sure that got corrected betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey gerard good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning david david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 david coming back to your comments about deposit betas can you share with us that of the surge that youve put a higher deposit beta on what gives you the confidence to say that maybe those deposits arent as sticky as that other and second what would make you or not make you but what would give you confidence to lower the deposit beta on that what do you need to see to maybe have a different expectation as we look out over the next months david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well the biggest driver is about the so what weve done is weve captured the nature of those deposits and the types of accounts that those deposits have gone in and weve looked at history and the nature of the deposit categories implied some would be retained longer than others if we miss it we get that we will capture more of that than were thinking if we started to see in our discussions with our commercial customers in particular that they want to maintain higher levels of liquidity than we think they will that would be an indicator of being able to put some of that to work longer we think were being conservative with that level but we just need to see how the economy continues to improve we need to have good conversations with our customers about how theyre thinking about it and theres still uncertainty out there so most of the surge is going to be run off is related to business services versus consumer gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate the color there and then the second i know theres going to be a number of variables in your answer to this question youve talked about a moment ago not wanting to extend outside cash on the balance sheet which is understandable you talked about your margin how its being negatively affected by this excess liquidity so the question is what are you what type of rate environment do you need to see where that margin degradation is eliminated from your liquidity or is it loan growth where you could reposition some of that liquidity into loans and therefore reducing it and at the same time driving up the yields in the portfolio david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah its important i mean just strategically we use our investment portfolios as a to manage our liquidity not to drive yield we dont have a lot of credit risk at our investment portfolio its lower than most peers and weve neutralized really the shortterm impacts of rates what we want to do is get back to what our business is taking deposits making loans and we think were in great shape and great markets to really leverage that liquidity into loan growth thats where the driver of improvement in margin will be weve stabilized our margin for the most part exppp in cash at and we think that over time obviously we can grow that and get back to a much higher margin over time an example of that is were going to spend we have billion of enerbank loans that were booking in the first quarter as i mentioned that has a carry of about on them and our new production consumer guys will add on in a year of billion plus well have closer to so that and our ascentium acquisition which is also fixed rate is performing extremely well we just continue to just stick to our knitting and execute our plan and our margin will move accordingly and so will nii gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 operator your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the ma side i know you mentioned it a couple of times in terms of nonbank interest particularly in your capital discussion maybe can you just elaborate a little bit around the nonbank areas that youre interested in specifically and then maybe if you can also talk about potential whole bank deal interest as well thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so with respect to nonbank weve obviously been active particularly in the capital market space we within capital markets announced sabal we want to continue to add to our capabilities whether it be an ma or in providing access to the capital markets to our commercial customers through a variety of different platforms dont have anything specifically in mind but were always looking for opportunities mortgage servicing rights has been an area where weve been acquisitive and we want to continue to be wealth management we think there are potentially some opportunities although lately multiples have been awfully rich but we want to continue to look for ways to grow that business and other fee incomegenerating businesses that we think allow us to grow and diversify our revenue and importantly provide capabilities to customers with respect to bank ma i think weve been consistent in saying that bank ma is not a strategic priority we think that bank ma can be very disruptive we have a solid plan we want to continue to focus on executing our plan the economics of bank ma have not looked terribly favorable in the past given where our stock traded continue to experience improvements so that changes the economics we revisit the idea with our board every year as part of our strategic planning process and just come to the conclusion that we think we can generate top quartile returns for our shareholders by being focused on executing our plan active in the nonbank ma space and so whole bank ma has just not been a priority for us david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp and john this is david ill add to the nonbank deal so as i mentioned the prioritization to really focus our capital allocation on growing our bank the corporate development group works with each of our segment leaders to identify capabilities that they would like to have companies that they have products and services that wed love to have to serve our customers its interesting after you do a couple of deals that weve had you get into the deal flow a little bit more than you would before and so we get more opportunities were going to be prudent about that capital allocation there and make sure things are really accretive for our shareholders as we seek to grow our business and ultimately our riskadjusted returns john pancari q analyst evercore isi regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 great thanks david and then on the capital markets business specifically i know given that youre still investing in that business heavily what is and but also given the size it is now what is the efficiency ratio youre achieving or the comp ratio that youre seeing in that business right now david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well capital markets is full of about four or five different sub businesses some of them have quite nice nicely up efficiency ratios others are not so high we dont really think of it that way we think of it as much as the capability we need to have that leverages all the other things that were doing in our business services segment so we really look at that together feebased businesses generally arent as efficient but thats okay and i think as long as theyre complementary and were making sure were as efficient in delivering those products and services then well be okay and if you look at our efficiency ratio over time this quarter were the second best in terms of efficiency ratio at and looking to improve that over time even though were adding some of these other businesses that are less efficient john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah got it if i could ask one more related thing just about on the comp expense linked quarter up million i know on slide you indicated that the performance of the fee business was part of that plus the day count how much of that linked quarter increase was purely from the fee performance david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well we had a so our yeartodate our base salary number is down quartertoquarter our base salaries were up just marginally most of that was really driven by incentives and we also had about million in the salary benefit line related to the hr asset valuation thats offsetting expense im sorry offsetting income about million i think if you look through the slide youll see that so you need to break that out too or deduct that too john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it got it all right thanks david david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial

corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc slide has a mediumterm potential not ph just income growth but i think its really helpful and all the drivers and a lot of thats been touched on on the call here if we were to think about how that might look for fees and expenses any thoughts on that either big picture or box some numbers around it david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well youre getting ahead of us a little bit matt were going to give you good numbers on that in january in terms of what the next few years are kind of as you wrap up the expense tied to all this revenue change our weve steadily been committed to positive operating leverage and weve done a really good job of controlling our expense base weve been around compound annual growth rate on expenses over the last four or five years we are seeing a bit of inflation thatll impact us some and our industry we suspect in weve got to find ways to overcome it and so well give you exactly what that commitment is in january but the bottom line is were growing our business were going to grow revenue were going to work on controlling our expenses and improving returns over time matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i guess in fees maybe specifically there i mean youve talked about a couple of bigger categories in terms of service charges as well as the capital markets but anything else to comment on kind of medium term for those categories like card and payments and indiscernible david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i think if you go down a couple line items the card and atm fees continue to grow nicely for us were up some yearoveryear a big part of thats volume is up volume is up because theres more transactions per owner and we have more owners you have more when you grow checking accounts this is what you get you get usage in particular debit card usage for us and so thats why we get so fixated on making sure the investments we make in the fastergrowing markets really help us grow customers and its paying off so you see it in the card and atm fees weve added wealth advisors to help us grow wealth management income you can see were up almost yearoveryear and now part of thats driven by the market markets had a nice run too and then mortgage income mortgage has been a little volatile weve had nice production this year and this past quarter but its probably not going to be as strong as it was in and regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 now we said that for relative to and weve had a really nice year so who knows but just proud of the fact that weve got a lot of different noninterest revenue sources that work in multiple different economies and rate environments and our goal is again to continue to grow our total revenue control expenses and control credit and we have nice returns to the shareholders matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your final question is from david konrad of kbw john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hi david david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning hey i just had a john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning i had a followup question on the securities portfolio and thanks for the color on the front book back book but it looks like securities yields actually went up a couple of basis points this quarter so curious if that was lower bond premium amortization and maybe the future benefits of higher rates that you could draw from lower expense there david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i mean premium amortization is about million weve benefited a little bit from that we think next quarter could be a tad lower than that so just around the edges we could see some improvements there my whole point on that was were just not going to take risk to juice a quarter or six months we really want to invest for the long haul and we just dont see putting our cash to work more than we have now we get a different rate environment we get a little steepness to the yield curve where we get paid for the risk and we might change our mind david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and any color on what bond premium amortization was looking back in was it significantly lower than million or is it not that material regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2021 david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah yeah i dont remember the numbers off the top of my head we were closer to the million per quarter range but i hadnt committed that to memory david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you appreciate it john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions
