i will start on slide of tonights presentation in the first quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share included in the results for the quarter was a million additional accrual for our updated estimate of the fdic special assessment net of this adjusting item first quarter earnings per share were relative to the prior quarter periodend loans held for investment decreased and periodend deposits increased both average loans and average deposits were flat our percentage of fdic insured deposits remained at of total deposits preprovision earnings in the first quarter increased from the fourth quarter or adjusting for the impacts of fdic special assessments in both quarters revenue in the linked quarter declined largely driven by lower noninterest income noninterest expense decreased on an adjusted basis driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses our provision for credit losses was billion in the quarter a decrease of million compared to the prior quarter the decrease was driven by million lower net reserve build partially offset by an million increase in net chargeoffs turning to slide i will cover the allowance in greater detail we built million in allowance this quarter bringing the balance to billion an increase of less than from the fourth quarter the slight increase in allowance balance was driven by modest builds in our auto and domestic card portfolios our total portfolio coverage ratio increased basis points to ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide our baseline economic forecast modestly improved this quarter compared to what we assumed last quarter which generally aligns with consensus we continue to consider a range of economic outcomes in our reserving process in our domestic card business the allowance coverage ratio increased by basis points to the increase in coverage was primarily driven by the denominator effect of the runoff of the fourth quarters seasonal outstandings capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 in our consumer banking segment the allowance increased by million resulting in a basis point increase to the coverage ratio the allowance increase was primarily driven by a higher level of originations in the auto finance business and finally our commercial banking allowance decreased by million primarily driven by portfolio contraction coverage ratio increased by basis point to turning to page ill now discuss liquidity total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased to billion about billion higher than last quarter our cash position ended the quarter at approximately billion up about billion from the prior quarter the increase in cash was driven by continued strong deposit growth in our retail banking business and the seasonality of our card balances our average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter remained strong and well above regulatory minimums at turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our first quarter net interest margin was basis points lower than last quarter and basis points higher than the year ago quarter the quarteroverquarter decrease in nim was largely driven by the impact of having one fewer day in the quarter modestly higher asset yields were mostly offset by higher funding costs in the quarter turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at approximately basis points higher than the prior quarter strong earnings and lower risk weighted assets more than offset the impact of cecl phasein dividends and share repurchases we repurchased approximately million of shares in the first quarter our repurchase activity in the quarter was impacted by blackout restrictions and daily purchase volume limitations related to the announcement of the discover transaction with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew and good evening everyone slide shows first quarter results in our credit card business credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide top line growth trends in the domestic card business remained strong in the first quarter yearover year purchase volume growth for the first quarter was ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear average loans increased and first quarter revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans the chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear to about above its pre pandemic level in the first quarter of the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased basis points from the prior year to on a sequential quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points the linkedquarter delinquency and chargeoff rate trends were modestly worse than what we would expect from normal seasonality we believe this is largely driven by lower and later tax refund payments to consumers so far in relative to what weve historically observed tax refunds are an important factor in credit seasonality each year they drive an improvement in delinquency payments and recoveries starting in february capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 our portfolio trends generally have a more pronounced seasonal pattern than the industry average last quarter our view was that the chargeoff rate was settling out about above levels in the near term that was based on an extrapolation of our delinquency inventory and flow rates over three to six months and that was the horizon of our estimate if the trend of lower tax refunds sustains it could raise the level of chargeoff somewhat in the near term but this does not change our view that credit is settling out modestly above pre pandemic levels in and the continuing deceleration in the pace of credit normalization trends sometimes referred to as the improving second derivative supports our view the pace of yearoveryear increases in both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the first quarter domestic card noninterest expense was up compared to the first quarter of with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense total company marketing expense of about billion for the quarter was up yearoveryear total company marketing drives growth and builds franchise in our domestic card and consumer banking businesses and builds and leverages the value of our brand our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business and in the first quarter domestic card marketing also included higher early spend bonuses driven by strong new account growth higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal airport lounges and capital one shopping we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise as always were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks slide shows first quarter results for our consumer banking business in the first quarter auto originations increased from the prior year quarter a return to growth after several quarters of yearoveryear declines consumer banking ending loans decreased about billion or yearoveryear on a linked quarter basis ending loans were essentially flat we posted another quarter of yearoveryear growth in consumer deposits first quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up just under billion or yearoveryear compared to the sequential quarter ending deposits were up about average deposits were up yearoveryear and up from the sequential quarter powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digitalfirst national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about yearoveryear largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs noninterest expense was down about compared to the first quarter of lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear compared to the linked quarter the chargeoff rate was down basis points while the delinquency rate was down basis points the linkedquarter chargeoff rate improvement modestly underperformed the typical seasonal patterns weve historically observed driven by the tax refund trends i just discussed even with the tax refund effects auto credit performance remains strong capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 slide shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about average loans were also down about the modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in to tighten credit ending deposits were down about from the linked quarter average deposits were down about the declines are largely driven by our continued choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances first quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter noninterest expense was up about the commercial banking annualized net chargeoff rate for the first quarter decreased basis points from the sequential fourth quarter to the commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was down basis points compared to the linked quarter the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased basis points to commercial credit risks continue to be most pronounced in the commercial office portfolio which is less than of total company loan balances in closing we continued to deliver strong results in the first quarter we posted another quarter of top line growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loans domestic card credit trends continue to stabilize and auto credit trends remained stable and in line with normal seasonal patterns we grew consumer deposits and we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet over the last decade weve driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as weve invested to transform our technology and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time for the full year we continue to expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be flat to modestly down compared to our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed cfpb late fee rule assuming the rule takes effect in october the timing of the new rule remains uncertain if the rule were to take effect at an earlier date it would be a headwind to the operating efficiency ratio of course the biggest news in the quarter was our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire discover weve submitted our applications for regulatory approval and were fully mobilized to plan and deliver a successful integration the combination of capital one and discover creates game changing strategic opportunities the discover payments network positions capital one as a more diversified vertically integrated global payments platform and adding capital ones debit spending and a growing portion of our credit card purchase volume to the discover network will add significant scale increasing the networks value to merchants small businesses and consumers and driving enhanced network growth in the credit card business were bringing together two proven franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer and we can accelerate the growth of our national digitalfirst consumer banking business by adding the discover consumer deposit franchise and the vertical integration benefits of the debit network we will be able to leverage and scale the benefits of our 11year technology transformation across every business and the network which will serve as the catalyst for innovation and enhanced capabilities in risk management and compliance underwriting marketing and customer service pulling way up the acquisition of discover as a singular opportunity it will create a consumer banking and global payments

significant value for merchants and customers and an unparalleled strategic and economic upside over the long term capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call josh please start the qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions one moment for question our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs you may proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey ryan richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp good evening ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so rich maybe to just start off on credit it sounds like youre running a little bit ahead of what you had outlined in the last quarter but when you put aside the timing of tax refund can you maybe just talk about what youre seeing from the consumer and do you think weve now reached the inflection where we can more closely follow seasonal patterns and once the noise settles do you think were kind of back at that level that you had outlined thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you ryan look i think that the story continues to be one of well in terms of theres sort of the consumer itself lets just talk about the consumer for a second and then lets talk about capital ones credit performance but just the health of the consumer i think the us consumer remains a source of strength in the economy the labor market remains strikingly resilient rising incomes have kept consumer debt servicing burdens relatively low by historical standards and when we look at our customers we see that they have higher bank balances than before the pandemic and this is true across income levels on the other hand of course inflation shrank real incomes for almost two years and in this high interest rate environment the cost of new capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 borrowing has gone up in every major asset class and i think at the margin these effects stretch some consumers financially so but on the whole id say consumers are in reasonably good shape relative pretty darn strong shape relative to historical benchmarks so in terms of capital ones performance we continue to see a settling out we consider we believe that for capital one i cant speak for all card issuers but we definitely have seen what we think is sort of a landing and our so we feel very good about where the credit is the point that i wanted to make about the tax refunds lets just pull up for a second on that the tax refunds are something that nobody knows for sure exactly whats behind seasonality but i think its a we believe a very important driver of seasonality its a bigger effect for us than other players because i think cash refunds just play a little bit bigger role in collectively across our customer base so the tax refunds in the very nearterm effect credit performance ryan what youre referring to the guidance that we gave that was not an annual guidance number that was saying if we just extrapolate in the very near window of just what we see in terms of delinquencies and delinquency roll rates thats where we would see chargeoffs and chargeoffs tend to be higher in the first half of the year so what were doing is giving a window to the higher part of chargeoffs for the year and we were saying they were settling out looked like around above levels part of that and so basically what im saying is that includes our assumptions about what happens with tax refund and the seasonality effect as we can see in the government data tax refunds are lower and later than by historical patterns and so that affects our nearterm credit performance and actually we often talk about well isnt the sixmonth window basically once chargeoffs start bubbling and going through the roll rate buckets we can pretty much see where chargeoffs are going tax refunds actually affect the payment rate in every bucket so our point was in the very near term it actually leads to a bit of a higher chargeoff rate than we had guided to over that near window but that doesnt change our view that credit has settled out but the was not a guidance for the year we havent really given credit guidance for the year what were really saying is we have seen credit settle out but we wanted to just flag that both in the credit card business and in our auto business while credit continues to be very strong and youve seen things like really improving delinquencies we just wanted to point out that in the very near term relative to what we have seen in terms of historical seasonality and kind of confirmed by what we watch as the patterns of tax refunds there is its coming in lower and later and we just wanted to flag that effect because it affects the very nearterm numbers that we cited earlier ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe as my quick followup for andrew i guess given richs answer what does that mean for the trajectory of the allowance it seems like weve heard a handful of other issuers talk about us being at the peak or maybe even coming down and potentially being below where it ended the prior year can you maybe just talk about what you think this means for capital one given your credit expectations andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 yeah sure ryan id like to say from my perspective that theres a simple answer but theres not and then theres a host of things that are going to drive allowance from here not the least of which is growth but just focusing on coverage and assuming thats what others are pointing to the first thing id highlight and i said in my talking points that fourth quarter had seasonal balances they quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage which we see every year so the coverage ratio this quarter up a bit from last quarter is really a result of that dynamic but if you look at coverage ratio now its largely in line with the preceding quarters i mean the biggest driver as we look ahead are the projected loss rates and as weve been saying for a number of quarters delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that and so every quarter were going to look out over the next months and then the reversion from there and were going to take into account a range of outcomes and uncertainties and so youve seen over the last few quarters keeping the coverage ratio flat i will note though even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might indicate a release otherwise you could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declines as we incorporate the uncertainty of that future projection into the allowance and so eventually the projected losses will when theyre lower will flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain and under that scenario you would see a decline but at this point im not going to be in the forecasting business of when that actually is going to take into account because like i said we really need to take the factor of uncertainty as we look ahead every quarter that we go through the reserving process jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you one moment for questions our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america you may proceed mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you rich if i could switch for a second to the discover acquisition theres been a lot of talk around deal approval particularly focusing around potential antitrust issues within the card business and i was wondering if you could share your thoughts and perspective on that issue if youve heard anything from regulators but also just to hear how you are thinking about that issue thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thank you mihir so we have filed our merger applications with both the fed and the occ and we are engaged with the sorry with the doj as they of course play a key role in advising the fed and the occ on competition questions we believe our applications make a very compelling case for approval we believe strongly that this merger will increase competition among banks credit card issuers and payment networks and provide significant benefits for consumers merchants and the communities that we serve while some have raised concerns about competition we believe that the facts in favor of the deal will be compelling on the network side lets remember that were not currently in that business if the deal is approved we will still have four networks just like we do today but we will be adding new customers and scale to the smallest by far of capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 the four networks and be able to leverage our technology talent and marketing capabilities to greatly enhance discovers competitive viability their market share was a decade ago and sits at just today the significant investments that we are planning will provide substantial benefits for consumers and merchants as weve outlined in our regulatory applications on the credit card side the regulators have found every time theyve studied it that the credit card market is highly competitive and not at all concentrated in fact its less concentrated today than it was years ago consumers can choose from over issuers all able to offer products with similar capabilities imagine this a card issued by a small credit union can be used every place that a card issued by a bank like capital one can be used anywhere in the world that kind of level playing field doesnt exist in any other industry and certainly not in airlines or grocery stores or many of the others theres a reason that we ask folks whats in your wallet we compete not only with these other issuers to gain your business in the first place but also with every other card you likely already own put another way we have to compete every day for every single transaction because our customers can simply choose at any moment to use another card and if they dont like the card they have they can stop using it entirely or close the account or switch to another card with another bank large or small in minutes we also believe that the facts will show that there are no barriers to entry in the credit card business as thousands of current issuers and the new ones are forming all the time demonstrate new and incumbent fintechs backed by significant vc funding are able to leverage the infrastructure of sort of credit card as a service players like marqeta to achieve instant scale and high growth also any existing bank can choose where in the credit spectrum they play simply by changing their credit policy lets also remember that consumers can choose to use another form of payment entirely cash debit or buy now pay later which has exploded onto the marketplace new fintechs are entering the payments in small dollar credit space every day all looking to take market share from traditional credit card players like capital one we faced this competition for years and well continue to face it in the future its powerful evidence of a healthy and fiercely competitive marketplace but we have been successful by focusing on the needs of our customers and offering credit card and retail banking products with the most straightforward terms and fewest fees in the industry were the only major bank where all of our deposit products come with no fees no minimums and no overdraft fees so pulling way up we believe the facts will show that this transaction is both procompetitive and pro consumer bringing our bestinclass products and services to a broader set of consumers and small businesses and greatly enhancing opportunities and benefits for merchants in the end that is what we believe the regulators will use their very vigorous process to evaluate mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc all right thank you that is helpful just turning back to the health of the consumer for a second for my followup if you could just talk a little bit about the environment for card acquisitions you did mention i think that the growth opportunity you see good growth opportunities in the card business so wondering if you could expand on that maybe talk about just some of the puts and takes as you consider where to make those investments are there parts of the market where youre being more cautious given the environment thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 mihir we are leaning in pretty much across the board in the card business powered by a healthy consumer and the traction that were getting in our business we are really all parts of the card business are seeing very nice account originations seeing good traction on the purchase volume side and so its very much a positive time for leaning in as you see reflected in our marketing as you see reflected in some of the growth numbers and as i see in numbers behind the numbers that you see just a lot of traction and just lets just savor for a second some of the things that are powering that two things that i would flag is one the continued investment that we are making to win at the top of the market and i think that not only affects our success at the top of the market but i really believe theres a lifting of all boats from those investments and that traction there also we continue to just get a have a lot of success powered by our technology transformation including not only the customer experience and some of the product capabilities that were able to offer but really impacts on the whole way that we run the business and very notably on the credit and marketing side of the business the ability to create mass customized offerings and realtime solutions just enables us to have more traction on the growth side also i just want to say that we also are pleased to see things picking up in the auto business and also we continue to have a lot of traction on our national bank jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan you may proceed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions this afternoon hey rich i want to make sure i fully understand what youre describing in terms of credit the framework is that chargeoff rates will be about higher than levels in the near term but now with tax refunds it might be a little bit higher than that that over time it will converge back towards slightly above levels when i look at the delinquencies and one of the things weve observed is that roll from delinquency to chargeoff is actually higher than it has been pretty much at any time in recent history does that suggest that delinquencies actually need to get back below levels to achieve that level of chargeoff performance richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so rick theres a lot first of all let me clarify some of the things that you were saying werent exactly i think as we intended to state them so let me just so we talked about so yes we talked about credit were saying credit is settling out we said in the very near term where chargeoffs are tend to be higher in the first half of the year in the near term based on extrapolation from delinquency buckets and roll rates we would expect them to settle out at higher than prepandemic that was a nearterm forecast that was not an annual forecast and then you just to clarify your comment said and over time it will converge back to slightly above and i just want to say those are your words not ours we have not given guidance on full year chargeoffs capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 we tend not generally to give guidance on full year chargeoffs but we very much like to give you the feel of how things are going so we are very much see credit settling out you can see that the trends that continue on the second derivative of delinquencies and thats a very positive thing the theres another factor that affects chargeoffs which is recoveries and the recoveries have been weve been saying for quite some time recoveries are lower than usual because of the very low chargeoffs we saw over the past three years so that all else equal pushes up net losses relative to prepandemic levels and that impact is probably larger and more prolonged for us than for some of our competitors because we tend to have higher recovery rates than the industry probably as a result of our business mix and our strategy and we tend to work most of our recoveries inhouse rather than selling debt so we see a longer tail of recoveries from past chargeoffs than most do so by the way the recoveries we had talked about recoveries there probably sort of been at their bottom in terms of that brown out and over time probably heading in a more positive direction but that also impacts the relationship between chargeoffs prepandemic and where they are today so pulling way up we dont have guidance for credit for the year we continue to be very happy about chargeoffs the way after years of after a long period of normalization that chargeoffs are settling out weve given we just wanted to flag that the seasonality lets just comment lets just pause for a second on the seasonality it still remains to be seen whether the tax refunds are just lower end of story or whether theyre later the key thing right now is they are lower cumulatively than they have been than they were prepandemic for this period of time and what well take a look at is how it plays out from here to see how much was just later and how much was lower but what were saying is to the extent that its lower than that impacts in the very near term the chargeoff numbers that we had talked about before but it doesnt change our view about credit settling out it doesnt change our view about very positively about the consumer about credit performance but its just something we wanted to flag across both the credit card and auto business richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you very helpful jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi you may proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi good afternoon i guess back to the discover combination any update to your thoughts around the timing of the deal close i know the fed and the occ just extended the comment period and i know youve put out there you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 expect late early so any change in terms of your expectation around the timing of the close or any of the key financial metrics that you set out richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thanks john so let me comment on the federal reserve and the occ extending the comment period its standard practice for the federal reserve to extend the comment period on bank mergers we expected the extension and we dont take any signaling on our deal from the feds decision here so with respect to the overall timing the fed and the occ typically take several months to work through bank merger applications in consultation with the doj on competition questions and they engage frequently with our team along the way and of course that process is underway and we continue to have the same views about the timing of all of this that we did at the time of the announcement john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay okay great thanks and then separately just regarding the your expectation on the cet1 front for a pro forma cet1 ratio of about just shy of any change to that expectation and any change to your thoughts around buyback activity in the near term could you remain active on that front thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah john with respect to the deal ill just say as we talked about when we announced it we at the time used a blend of consensus estimates of where we would have the cet1 at the time of close theres a number of variables that are going to move between now and legal day one not just the standalone performance of each of our companies but balance sheet marks some of which are driven by credit and stock price and so im not going to be in the business of recasting every time a little number moves but i will say our valuation of the deal considered a wide range of outcomes and so we remain just as excited today about the financial and strategic benefits of the transaction as we did when we announced the deal with respect to our standalone repurchases capital ones ill note that the agreement with discover does not prohibit us from buying shares i noted in my prepared remarks we were blacked out for a period leading up to the deal and afterwards the sec has safe harbor rules that limit the daily average amount of purchases we can do for a period of time after the announcement so as a result of those limitations q1 had a pace that was less than what weve done in recent quarters i will also just note that theres also blackout restrictions on repurchases during the proxy vote period but again outside of those blackouts were not prohibited and were able to continue repurchasing shares jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with td cowen you may proceed moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 great thanks rich putting aside the tax refund thing i mean yours were sitting here looking youve still got what has been a somewhat persistently high inflation environment and the potential for increases in unemployment given the nature of your portfolio youve got kind of a lower end consumer and higherend consumer how do you think about that those factors in terms of thinking about what type of chargeoff level youre going to reach over some period of time not a particular point in time but over some point in the next year or two like where you think about that are they driving a higher level of chargeoff expectations or how should we think about that richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp moshe so our i think what youre partly getting at is because we have part of our portfolio is subprime consumers how do we feel about how theyre performing and sort of in the context of an environment of higher inflation and so on let me just comment a little bit about the subprime consumer in the global financial crisis we observed that credit metrics in subprime moved earlier in both directions subprime we saw that but then we saw sort of everything move proportionately in fact subprime moved frankly somewhat less proportionately than prime as a multiple but obviously all portfolios worsened quite a bit during the global financial crisis in the pandemic subprime credit improved more and more quickly than prime but it also began to normalize more quickly too and of course thats in the context of lower income consumers seeing disproportionate benefits of government aid and then unwinding that over time and subprime is of course not synonymous with lower income although they are somewhat correlated so on the other hand so if we look at how they have been doing the income growth from for lets take lower income consumers has been consistently higher over the past several years and we have seen really quite other than the tax refund effect which does show up more in our lower end part of our customer base than the higher credit end really we have seen the subprime performance be very strong it just worsened faster and then on a proportional basis everything caught up with it but it frankly always seems to be a first mover and it settled out frankly a little bit earlier than started settling out a little bit earlier than the rest of our portfolio so based on current performance we feel very good across the credit spectrum we also it certainly catches our attention when we see the inflation specter sort of become greater lately so we have a real eye on that as you know we continue to look at the marketplace and trim around the edges and so on but the net impression that i would leave you is we continue to feel very good about really the full spectrum of our customers we continue to lean into the growth opportunities we have for some time just been doing some trimming around the edges and just being a little tighter on the credit lines and things like that credit line increases but the impression that i want to leave with you is that we are still pretty feel good about this marketplace and the growth opportunities there moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen got it and maybe just as a followup question you alluded to or andrew alluded to the fact that you expect that late fee you can still kind of achieve your objectives from a efficiency ratio even with the late fee coming into effect but could you talk a little bit about your thoughts about any mitigating efforts that youre planning or are in the process of doing or is it something that youre going to try and use from a competitive standpoint to take share how do you think about it capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay yeah thanks moshe so lets just pull up and reflect on the fact that the cfpbs rule on late fees is scheduled to take effect on may we are prepared to implement the rule on this timeline if necessary but ongoing litigation efforts continue to create uncertainty on the ultimate outcome and the timing of the rule as weve said before when the rule is implemented there will be significant impact to our pl we expect that this impact will gradually resolve itself within a couple of years from the implementation of our mitigating actions these mitigating actions include changes to our policies products and investment choices some of these mitigating actions have already been implemented and are underway we are planning on additional actions once we learn more about where the litigation settles out ultimately these mitigating actions will play through different line items in the pl and will mitigate the impact of the late fee rule on our pl within a couple of years of their implementation jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo you may proceed donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes rich can you provide your latest thought on auto lending i know a lot of focus has been around cars and used car prices have been a little bit lighter recently as well as the tax issue maybe talk a bit about a potential pivot there richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so were feeling very good about the auto business so lets just pull way up auto industry margins have recovered somewhat over the past few quarters our origination volumes in q1 were up on a yearoveryear basis and quarteroverquarter basis and were pleased with that growth now there are still headwinds to the auto business affordability remains a concern due to the combined effects of high interest rates and still high car prices and even as car prices have normalized significantly from their peaks they havent yet reached a new equilibrium so we anticipated the risks in this business tightening up credit back in i think several quarters before some of our competitors as a result the performance of recent originations from and has been really strong and frankly even better than our prepandemic origination and vintage over vintage that risk remains stable and as margins have recovered a bit were seeing an opportunity to lean back in so our years of investments in industryleading technology and credit infrastructure have allowed us to remain nimble and enabled us to make targeted adjustments to our origination strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risks so looking ahead we remain confident in the business that were booking and bullish about the opportunities for growth so we continue to set pricing in terms that were comfortable with and feel good about the opportunities that we see in the market and after talking for really a couple of years about sort of dialing back i think this is sort of a period where its moving more into a leaning into a situation for capital one and were i think very capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 benefited by the choices that we made over the last couple of years and seeing very strong performance in our vintages donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw you may proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you rich i think your point on tax refund is clearly a very valid one interestingly though to your point on the second derivative thats improved quite nicely even into march and i think when i look at the tax refund stats now from the irs it seems like youve seen a catchup in refunds and it seems like the average refund numbers have kind of come in line with last year if not slightly higher so i think those are improving too is there a lag effect there so like should we see that more pronounced if thats the case in april and may how has it been in the past richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so i can see that youre a student of tax refunds just think of all the areas of expertise that youve developed over the years trying to really get your head around this credit card business things that neither you nor i thought we would really have to learn let me make a couple comments here so a key question is what are we benchmarking things to so relative to if we talk about relative to last year the things were even lagging relative to last year and theyve actually crossed over very very recently crossed over the curve from last year which i think youre referring to but then last year really was somewhat of an outlier relative to prepandemic now one might ask well why didnt we just do use last year as the seasonality benchmark last year itself was an odd year and from a credit point of view with all the normalization it was hard to read things through the noise as we watch the patterns this year were going to really end up comparing by the time its done how this year compares to last year and whether collectively this year and last year represent sort of a new seasonality that we have to modify relative to the past i think its premature on that and relative to reading seasonality its really hard to look at last years credit metrics just because there was so much normalization so weve had an eye on this we have we have tended to stick with our seasonality benchmarks which are developed over a number of years and i think when this is when were done with this period well sit back and look at it and say did we learn something about the business that where seasonality might be less magnified in a business like ours than it was before i think it is too early to tell but to your other point even relative to last year it has very recently crossed over in terms of tax refunds capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 and yes to your point these are things that themselves then have lag effects because people have to get the refunds then they have to make payments so this is why very much we are flagging a phenomenon that is sort of in the middle of happening and the key thing will be by the time its done whats the cumulative tax refund effect and were just kind of sharing with you as we go along and the reason im particularly leaning into this particular one is because last time we made a very nearterm sort of extrapolation just from our windows of delinquency buckets about where the given that in a year the high part of the year is in the first half of the year we were just kind of saying in that high part of the year where things were sort of settling out and i wanted to give that little bit were not revising the number but just to say if the seasonality patterns are probably driven by the tax refund effect if it doesnt catch up to historical patterns then in the very nearterm the numbers will be higher than that in this very this window were talking about higher than the number that i said sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood understood the second derivative looked good nonetheless for march richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so look can i just i want to just seize that point sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp the second derivative continues to be strong in fact when you look at sort of all the card players that you can see the strength of capital ones second derivative theres another topic so you didnt know when you were studying all that calculus that this would be at the heart of what you do but so theres lots of good to pull from this i just wanted to just clarify the tax refund effect which i think has a little bit more impact on capital one than certain other players and to point out that we actually think we see that effect in both of our consumer businesses sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great just one followup for andrew just on the capital return question earlier richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc can we step up the run rate relative to some of the last quarters as we look ahead i know theres been a lot of volatility on some of the regulatory proposals on capital but as we look ahead i know theres no limitations but can we see a step up in the level of capital return relative to the past few quarters as we look ahead given your capital levels today andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well theres two parts to that sanjay the first is given the transaction we are in the process of submitting a new capital plan so thats just a procedural piece so once that new capital plan is approved then we have unlimited capacity relative to the scb in this intervening period the amount that we repurchase is constrained to what weve requested jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research you may proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good evening rich and andrew following up on your comments on auto how much of an advantage is your excess capital position are you seeing competitors who are capital constrained and perhaps cant take advantage of the attractive market conditions to the same degree and then ill just ask my followup now as capital one continues to grow could you speak to your category ii preparedness andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yes ill start bill with the oh go ahead rich do you want to do the competitive dynamics in auto richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp in auto im here my observation about the auto business is that its still a very competitive marketplace but when we see our opportunities to grow we tend to zig a little bit while others zag and so we sort of pulled back for a little while and others leaned in and my point is really now i think were leaning in and others are pulling back a little bit more i hadnt really sort of analyzed it in terms of really capital choices really as much as just the very natural rhythms of the marketplace and some of the advantages that capital one has by virtue of our choices that we made over the last couple of years but well have to think about that but i just think this is just very much sort of as youve seen numerous times in the past where theres a little bit of an inflection point for capital one at a time thats a little different and occasionally in a different direction than the inflection points of others capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp and then bill with respect to category ii well first let me just note were going to be below the billion threshold at closing and the trigger is really a fourquarter average beyond that so i just wanted to mention the specifics of what is going to trigger it but within category ii to category iii theres really three big distinctions the first one is losing the tailoring benefit for lcr and nsfr and you can see based on the ratios that we hold there and our conservatism around liquidity we feel very well prepared the other two which are the inclusion of aoci in regulatory capital and the dta threshold going from to those are both already included at least in what was proposed for the basel iii endgame rules we all know that those proposals are being debated and refined but ultimately we were looking at those two implications as part of the proposal anyway and so we dont really see a big difference in the longterm implications at least as we sit today again the proposal may take a different form but from a planning perspective those were two things that we already had our eye on and so we ultimately feel well prepared all of the implications of either category ii or the basel iii endgame proposals if they were to go in as currently constructed jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our final question comes from jeff adelson with morgan stanley you may proceed jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good evening thanks for fitting me in rich i just wanted to circle back on your comment about how you continue to kind of trim around the edges i think last quarter you were suggesting that the trimming was sort of abating after a number of years of trimming but given your comments today about how youre continuing to lean in how the us consumer remains strength of source how are you thinking about potentially opening up the credit box a little bit more from here and relatedly does the pending deal with discover factor into how youre thinking about allocating capital at all into more growth at this point richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff we the trimming around the edges is of course what we do all the time in reactively to not only what we observe in the marketplace but what we think may be coming in the marketplace we are very much sort of in the same place we were three months ago when weve been talking about this in other words the trimming around the edges and the dialing back was a little bit more pronounced in the quarters during the big credit normalization then it has been as we see things settling out and the drivers of that continue to be probably in addition to what i said about the consumer very much also the observing our credit performance not only just the overall portfolio performance but very much the performance of our originations and strikingly our originations continue to come out generally on top of each other quarterafter quarter obviously thats lagged data that were viewing but were weve been struck by how long its been and how consistently its been that our originations have been generally on top of each other and a lot of that comes from the trimming around the edges that we have been doing even as theres been some underlying a little bit sort capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 25apr2024 of worsening of overall consumer credit metrics so were in a very similar place to where we were we feel good about our credit performance and origination performance we are leaning in across the credit spectrum with respect to the discover deal its not really altering our origination strategy thats very much continuing as it was before obviously were very excited about the discover deal but i think that with respect to our own strategy its really pretty much the same as it was before jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc and i also wanted to just ask really quickly about the small business card strategy i know you recently just launched that new venture x business card recently it seems like a really unique value proposition with the charge card component can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunity to drive growth there and maybe how thats going so far any early read into the type of customers youre getting richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay yes jeff so we launched the venture x business card broadly in the third quarter of last year and were pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far so venture x business much like our spark cash plus card was developed to help business owners run and invest in their business with no preset spending limit great travel benefits and elevated earn everywhere and its a great example of our businesses leveraging each others innovations because weve taken many of the industryleading travel features of our consumer venture x product and combined them with the businessgrade capabilities of our small business offerings including the flexible spending capacity that is designed for larger businesses so we have been investing in our small business card program and more broadly to win at the top of the market for years and this launch stands on the shoulders of all of that investment it stands on the shoulders of our technology transformation and is another example in the continuing drive of capital one to win at the top of the market across consumers and small business so i appreciate the question and we certainly are excited by our continuing progress jeff norris senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp thanks rich and andrew thanks everybody for joining us this evening and for your continuing interest in capital one have a great
