joining us today im going to begin on slide i am very pleased with our results for the fiscal second quarter and the first half for the fiscal year especially given the challenging market conditions we continue to invest in growth across all of our businesses in the private client group excellent retention and recruiting of financial advisors contributed to bestinclass growth with domestic net new assets of over the 12month period furthermore the charles stanley acquisition which closed during the quarter significantly expanded our presence in the uk which is a very attractive market for wealth management in the capital markets business while investment banking revenues were negatively impacted by the heightened market volatility during the quarter we continue to see strong pipelines as the expertise we have both added organically and through niche acquisitions has been performing extremely well in the fixed income business we announced the pending acquisition of sumridge partners during the quarter which will enhance our platform with technologydriven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience in dealing with corporates raymond james bank grew loans an impressive during the quarter reflecting attractive growth across all the loan categories the tristate capital acquisition which is expected to close by the end of our fiscal third quarter will add a bestinclass thirdparty securitiesbased lending capability while also diversifying our funding sources they will also bring a diversified asset manager in chartwell which will be a great addition to our multiboutique model in asset management so as we always do in any market cycle we continue to invest for the long term always putting clients first its in uncertain market conditions such as these that remind us the importance of focusing on and making decisions for the long term while our strategy may not always be popular over shortterm periods today i believe we are wellpositioned for the expected increases in shortterm rates with record clients domestic cash sweep balances strong loan growth at raymond james bank high concentration of floating assets and an ample balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios which are all well in excess of regulatory requirements turning to results in the fiscal second quarter the firm reported net revenues of billion a net income of million or earnings per diluted share of despite higher asset management and related administrative fees reflecting the strong yearoveryear growth in pcg assets in feebased accounts diluted eps declined compared to the prior quarter primarily due to bank loan loss provisions for credit losses during the current raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 quarter to support the strong loan growth compared to a benefit in the prioryear quarter this quarter also had a higher effective tax rate which paul shoukry will explain later on the call excluding million of acquisitionrelated expenses quarterly adjusted net income was million or earnings per diluted share of annualized return on equity for the quarter was and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was an impressive result especially in this very low rate environment and given our strong capital position moving to slide we ended the quarter with total assets under administration of trillion and record pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion these figures include the assets from the acquisition of charles stanley which was completed on january excluding the impact of the acquisition total client assets under administration declined compared to the immediately preceding quarter financial assets under management of billion decreased sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by declines in equity markets during the quarter we ended the quarter with a record financial advisors a net increase of over the prioryear period and over the preceding quarter which includes the charles stanley financial advisors our focus on supporting advisors and their clients has led us to strong results in terms of advisor retention as well as recruiting experienced advisors to the raymond james platform throughout our multiple affiliation options over the trailing 12month period ending march we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing production and approximately billion of client assets at their previous firms and highlighting our industry leading growth we generated domestic pcg net new assets of approximately billion over the four quarters ending march representing approximately of domestic pcg assets at the beginning of the period second quarter domestic pcg net new asset growth was nearly annualized client domestic cash sweep balances grew sequentially to a record billion raymond james bank continued to generate impressive loan growth up yearoveryear and during the quarter to a record billion this growth was driven by securitiesbased loans and residential mortgages largely to pcg clients as well as strong corporate loan growth now moving on to the results on slide the private client group generated quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million on a yearoveryear basis revenues grew and pretax income grew primarily driven by higher assets in feebased accounts the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million capital markets revenues declined over the prioryear period primarily driven by lower fixed income brokerage revenue and equity underwriting revenues sequentially quarterly net revenues decreased driven by lower investment banking revenues primarily due to the impact of increased geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties as i referenced earlier in march we announced the acquisition of sumridge partners a technologydriven fixed income market maker specializing in investmentgrade and highyield corporate bonds municipal bonds and institutional preferred securities this acquisition is further evidence of our continued commitment to providing cuttingedge technology to advisors clients and stakeholders we currently anticipate the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of subject to regulatory approval raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 the asset management segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million on a yearoveryear basis revenues grew and pretax income grew over the fiscal second quarter of primarily a result of higher assets under management raymond james bank generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million net revenue growth was primarily due to higher asset balances as the bank generated attractive growth in its loan portfolio along with net interest margin expansion despite revenue growth pretax income declined compared to a yearago quarter caused by the banks loan loss provision for credit losses in the current quarter reflecting strong loan growth compared to the banks loan benefit for credit losses in comparative periods looking to the fiscal yeartodate results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion during the first six months of fiscal up over the same period a year ago record earnings per diluted share of increased compared to the first six months of fiscal additionally we generated strong annualized return on equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the sixmonth period moving to the fiscal yeartodate segment results on slide the private client group capital markets and asset management segments all generated record net revenues and record pretax income during the first six months of the fiscal year again reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses now for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results i will turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks paul starting with consolidated revenues on slide quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and declined sequentially record asset management fees grew over the prior years fiscal second quarter and over the preceding quarter private client group assets in feebased accounts ended the quarter relatively unchanged compared to december however adjusting for the acquired assets of charles stanley pcg assets in feebased accounts declined approximately creating a headwind for asset management revenues in the fiscal third quarter so i would expect somewhere around a sequential decline in this line item in the upcoming fiscal third quarter ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly skipping ahead to investment banking revenues as paul described this line item declined significantly compared to the preceding quarter but at million it was still a very strong quarter compared to our results prior to fiscal given the heightened market volatility we would not be surprised to match this quarters results for the next two quarters which would result in the investment banking revenues ending fiscal close to the record set in fiscal while our pipelines are strong theres a lot of uncertainty over the next two quarters that could impact investment banking revenues positively or negatively for the rest of the fiscal year other revenues of million were down compared to the preceding quarter primarily due to lower revenues from affordable housing investments previously known as tax credit funds the pipeline for the business is very strong but the timing of closings is more uncertain given the rapid cost increases impacting affordable housing developers moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record billion up billion or over the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets notably billion or of total cash sweep balances are held in the client interest program the vast majority of which are raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 invested in very shortterm treasuries and could be redeployed to generate much higher yields over time either at our own bank or with thirdparty banks as interest rates increase and demand for cash balances recover turning to slide combined net interest income and bdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up a robust from the preceding quarter this growth is largely a result of strong asset growth and a higher net interest margin at raymond james bank which increased basis points to for the quarter the increase of the banks nim during the quarter was attributable to a higheryielding asset mix given the strong loan growth as the march interest rate increase really wont start benefiting the banks nim until the fiscal third quarter for example following the march rate increase the banks current spot nim is around the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased to basis points in the quarter and the spot rate is just over basis points reflecting the march rate increase both the nim and the average yield from thirdparty banks are expected to increase further with additional rate increases as less than of the firms interest earning assets have fixed rates and those assets have an average effective duration of less than four years and all of the deposit sweep relationships with thirdparty banks are floating rate contracts so we should have significant upside from rising shortterm interest rates to that point let me walk through how we are positioned to rising shortterm interest rates based on current clients domestic cash sweep balances which decreased by over billion to billion thus far in april largely due to the quarterly fee billings and income tax payments using static balances and an instantaneous 100basis point increase in shortterm interest rates which includes the 25basispoint rate increase in march we would expect incremental pretax income of nearly million per year with approximately of that reflected as net interest income and reflected as account and service fees this estimate assumes a blended deposit beta of around for the first 100basispoint increase commensurate with what we experienced in the last rate cycle importantly this analysis does not incorporate the tristate capital acquisition which should provide incremental upside to higher shortterm interest rates as the vast majority of their billion of balance sheet assets are also floating rate assets as they have always shared a similar approach to limiting duration risk moving to consolidated expenses on slide starting with our largest expense compensation the compensation ratio for the quarter was which increased from in the preceding quarter but remained below the yearago period compensation ratio of and below our target in a lowinterest rate environment the sequential increase was mainly the result of lower capital markets revenues which led to the revenue mix shift towards higher compensable revenues in the pcg segment as advisor payouts particularly to independent advisors who cover their own overhead expenses are typically higher than the associated compensation of our other businesses on a sequential basis the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the first calendar quarter of each year as well as annual salary increases and continued hiring to support our growth noncompensation expenses of million increased sequentially predominantly driven by the bank loan provision for credit losses compared to a loan loss release in the preceding quarter as well as higher communication and information processing expenses excluding the bank loan provision in acquisitionrelated expenses which creates some noise in the comparison noncompensation expenses of million grew over the preceding quarter raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 also keep in mind expenses included just over two months of results for charles stanley which closed on january so overall we have remained focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non compensationrelated expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows a pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the fiscal second quarter we generated a pretax margin of and an adjusted pretax margin of in line with our target in this low interest rate environment based on the expectation for the additional increases in shortterm interest rates we will revisit our pretax margin and compensation ratio targets at our upcoming analyst and investor day scheduled for may hopefully by then we will have more clarity on other important variables such as the outlook for investment banking revenues the level of business development expenses as conferences and travel continue to ramp up and the impact of recently closed and pending acquisitions on slide at the end of the quarter total assets were billion a sequential increase reflecting the addition of approximately billion in assets mostly segregated client cash balances from charles stanley as well as solid growth of loans at raymond james bank liquidity and capital remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion increasing during the quarter primarily due to significant special dividends from our wellcapitalized subsidiaries during the quarter the total capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be wellcapitalized providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth the effective tax rate for the quarter did increase to up from in the preceding quarter the primary drivers of the sequential increase are the favorable impact from sharebased compensation that vested in the preceding quarter and nondeductible losses on our corporateowned life insurance portfolio due to equity markets that are used to fund our nonqualified benefit plans compared to a nontaxable gains on these portfolios in the preceding quarter slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters as of april billion remains available under the boardapproved share repurchase authorization due to regulatory restrictions we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing the tristate capital holdings acquisition currently expected to occur by the end of the fiscal third quarter as we explained on prior calls our current plan is to offset the share issuances associated with the transaction after closing but given the heightened market volatility well obviously keep a watchful eye on market conditions between now and then lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank the credit quality of the banks loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve the bank loan loss provision of million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans held for investment ended the quarter at down from at march and essentially unchanged from at december now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 thank you paul as i said at the start of the call i am pleased with our results and while there are many uncertainties i believe we are wellpositioned to drive growth across all our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected sequential decline of asset management and related administrative fees that paul described earlier however focusing more long term our recruiting pipelines remain strong and combined with solid retention i am optimistic we will continue delivering industry leading growth as advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and leading technology platform furthermore the addition of charles stanley provides an opportunity to accelerate our growth in the uk wealth management market through multiple affiliation options similar to our advisorchoice offerings in the us and canada in the capital markets segment ma pipeline remains robust but closings will be heavily influenced by market conditions throughout the remainder of the fiscal year and while market uncertainty and geopolitical concerns loom in the near future i am confident we have made significant investments over the past five years to strengthen our platform and to grow our team and productive capacity positioning us well to grow over the long term in the fixed income space although depository clients are still flush with cash and searching for yield optimization opportunities we expect results to be more volatile over the next few quarters given elevated interest rate uncertainty additionally we expect the pending acquisition of sumridge partners to enhance our current position in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace in the asset management segment while the financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third quarter lower due to equity markets we are confident that strong growth of our assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition upon the close of tristate capital we expect chartwell investment partners which will operate as a subsidiary of carillon tower associates to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution and operational and market synergies and raymond james bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet raymond james bank is wellpositioned for rising shortterm rates and we expect tristate capital to further enhance this benefit to the firm given their floating rate asset concentration and their leading position in thirdparty sbl business before closing i want to call your attention to our annual corporate responsibility report that was released during the quarter the report which can be found on our investor relations website highlights our foundational commitments to our people sustainability community and governance and illustrates our longstanding approach to doing business rooted in our values and brought to life through our peopledriven culture this report summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisors and associates across the firm do to contribute to their communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment as always and foremost i want to thank our advisors and their associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day with that operator please open the line up for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you very much operator instructions and well proceed with our first question on the line from alex blostein with goldman sachs go ahead with your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for taking the question so i wanted to start with the question around capital you guys saw the tier leverage drop down over basis points quarteroverquarter at the holding company level it looks like its all coming from the brokerdealer the cash balances picked up there and liabilities did as well so maybe flesh out a little bit sort of what happened what drove the increase this quarter thats kind of weighing on tier leverage a bit here and then more importantly is that something you expect to reverse pretty quickly and i guess regardless should we still expect you guys to buy back all the stock that you expect to issue on the back of tristate closing paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah thanks alex i think before going into sort of the quartertoquarter movements just stepping back at tier leverage ratio were still well over times the regulatory requirement to be wellcapitalized at so just important to note that we still have a significant amount of capital to continue investing in growth growing the balance sheet and growing our businesses and with that being said since the beginning of the fiscal year our client cash balances have increased over which is an amazing number if you think about it were six months into our fiscal year and most of that has come as you mentioned to the brokerdealer in the client interest program the vast majority of which are used to fund shortterm treasuries were talking 30day 60day type treasuries pursuant to the segregated asset sec rules so these are the first cash balances that will be redeployed either onbalance sheet or offbalance sheet as demand from thirdparty banks recover after the increase in shortterm interest rates and just the kind of dimension that impact to our tier leverage ratio before the pandemic these balances were hovering right around billion so at billion of really overflow is what i would call this in the client accommodation thats eating into about basis points of the tier leverage ratio and frankly when we set the target a little less than a year ago we dont look at this impact on this portion of the balance sheet the same as we do other portions of the balance sheet because again theyre invested in or 60day treasuries which are obviously highly liquid so its really just geography in terms of putting this on the balance sheet here versus putting it with third party banks where its not on the balance sheet and doesnt eat into tier leverage ratio which we will do when their demand resumes or funding our own bank which we would earn a higher spread on obviously than we do on 30day treasuries so hopefully that answers your question there alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it so dont want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like the tier leverage minimum is not quite the minimum in absolute terms we should really think about where that balance sits and where that sort of comes from and how that impacts capital ratio is a little bit more dynamically is that right paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 yeah i mean i think thats a good way of thinking about it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay great and then just piggybacking on the point you made around the building cash levels obviously weve seen that across the industry but with rising rates the conversations around cash sorting obviously picking up pretty materially in the last cycle if my math is right i think you guys have seen about a to decline in sort of peak to trough cash balances across the franchise given the changes in the customer mix and how much youve grown is that still the right framework to think about how much could leave in this cycle understanding the pace of rates is likely to be much faster this time around paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think youre right in the last cycle it was around a to decline but i mean remember we just in the last six months increased balances by so if that if we see a decline over the next year or two as rates rise and really the decline happens after the first basis points then its not really that big of a deal considering we just got that in the last six months here and its sitting in shortterm treasuries and remember that decline in cash balances will be more than offset by the increase in shortterm interest rates based on our assumptions and the other factor that you need to consider is when you do have a decline in cash like that due to cash sorting the value of that cash becomes more valuable so as an example today the spot yield of our balances with thirdparty banks is right around basis points which is right around fed funds target before the pandemic we were getting fed funds target plus or basis points so the spread on not only those balances but also loans in a more cashtight environment the cash becomes more valuable and that offsets a portion of the impact from declining cash balances in the system as well alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great if i could squeeze in one more busy morning obviously between a bunch of calls here but tristate so i believe you initially targeted billion of sort of funding replacement on their balance sheet once the deal closes is that still the case i think in the first year youre targeting you said about billion why wouldnt you go a little faster given that their deposit beta i think is going to be a lot higher than yours paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean you asked about the cash sorting issue just in your prior question so were going to look at they bring in diversified funding sources they have very good depository clients many of which are also clients on the asset side and theyre going to continue running independently of course so were going to do what makes the most sense for both them and us were not beholden to the assumptions we used and the due diligence and valuation process nor are we going to make decisions to boost shortterm results that may compromise longterm results so were going to as we do with all of our decisions make them based on whats best for our investors over the long term alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for entertaining all the questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i just want to reiterate tristate operating as an independent subsidiary has to take care of its clients cash needs and commitments too so its not just math right we just they need theyll have a lot of client balances to manage and the billion was just a rough estimate of the excess where we could replace them without they felt without impacting their business so operator thank you very much well get to our next question on the line from steven chubak with wolfe research go right ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning pauls so wanted to start off with just a question on tristate the rate backdrop is clearly much more constructive since the deal was first announced and given the revenue upside is coming from less compensable spread income i was hoping you could provide some thoughts on the updated tsc accretion expectations based on the current forward curve and how we should be thinking about where ppnr margins could potentially settle out with higher rates in a fully integrated tsc deal as we think about your normalized earnings power paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think theres a lot baked into that question and i dont think its theres a lot that has changed since we announced the acquisition in the to type accretion but i dont think maybe at the analyst investor day we can get into more detail with all the different variables one thing i will say is that their loan growth since we announced the transaction and theyre a separate public company so i also dont want to get too much into their own results or what the upside is to higher rates going forward for their results until after we close the transaction but i think i can say that the loan growth since they since we announced the transaction has been much stronger than we were projecting of course we try to use conservative projections but theyve had really continued to have strong loan growth since announcing the transaction so that coupled with the higher increases in shortterm rates that we were expecting and again vast majority of their assets are floating rate assets certainly are nice tailwinds for us going forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and paul i mean any insights you can share just in terms of how we should think about that terminal ppnr margin i think the big debate is youre going to be integrating this deal the accretion tailwinds have certainly been favorable over the last few quarters you did note that loan growth has also come in better the big debate is how much of that revenue are you going to allow to fall to the bottom line versus get reinvested back in the business i just want to get some sense as to how we should be thinking about peak margin potential over the next couple of years paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah steve i would say that the peak margin potential is going to be driven more by the increase in shortterm interest rates and the impact that has on our 75plus billion of client cash balances then the any particular raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 transaction that weve closed or that is pending so i would say i would look at that and as i said earlier on the call that impact in the first basis points were projecting to be somewhere in the million range so its obviously significant accretion to earnings for us in the first basis points steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful and then just if i could squeeze in one more just on the securities portfolio i know historically you guys have tended to favor more shortend versus longend gearing certainly given the pace of fed tightening thats anticipated thats going to serve you pretty well here but given the forward curve is actually starting to bake in a couple of fed cuts a few years out wanted to get some perspective on whether theres any appetite to actually extend duration given some of the higher nbs proxies in particular which could potentially protect you in the event looking at a couple of years out that the fed does in fact start easing and maybe we dont have and we dont have the soft landing that many of us were hoping for paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes so at this point weve i think weve undertaken some criticism for being flexible and flexibility just isnt maximizing shortterm earnings for us its maximizing the business model to be able to take advantages of acquisitions investments and keeping flexible and difficult times which right now is uncertain so after waiting were certainly not ready to lock in shortterm rates or longerterm rates while were in the middle of what we think will be an increasing interest rate cycle but that doesnt mean at some point in the future where we think with the asset liability management we wouldnt lock in a portion but thats not on the nearterm goals right now steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood thanks so much for taking my questions paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks steve operator thank you thank you very much well get to our next question on the line from manan gosalia with morgan stanley go right ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning paul and paul i wanted to get your thoughts a little bit more on the deposit beta and the assumption for this cycle so first if you can remind us where deposit rates peaked in the last cycle and then if i think about the differences this time around on a macro level were getting a much faster pace of rate hikes than last time inflation is higher the feds going to shrink their balance sheet sooner and for raymond james specifically the bank is a lot larger and you have the upcoming acquisition of tristate so with that in mind what are your thoughts on how the deposit beta dynamic will play out and what that will do to deposit rate cycle raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean there are a lot of differences this cycle versus last rate cycle so your guess is probably as good as ours were going to be very competitive and try to be generous with our clients the kind of assumptionguesstimate that we have for the first basis points which includes the first rate increase in march where the deposit beta was obviously extremely low across the industry assumes that theres a pickup in deposit beta with the subsequent increases so in the last rate cycle we peaked out at around basis points on average for the cost of funds and the sweep and thats when fed funds target topped out at about so usually the investable cash going back to the cash sorting topic gets invested in shortterm alternatives like purchase money market funds i think we have the best purchase money market fund platform in the industry for our clients who are looking to optimize their yield so thats kind of how were thinking about it in terms of bifurcating the cash in the account and how we pass on in the sort of operational cash component of the accounts but were obviously going to look at the competitive environment as rates rise and try to be fair and competitive with our clients paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think if you look to that all cycles are different and things happen different so the first thing is you have to be flexible and responsive weve done a good job even planning out various scenarios and cycles what we do well in advance so our best guess right now is itll be like the last cycle just faster so we may have to move quicker but we think the relative spreads and things will still be there we certainly have a lot more cash and economically even though when you lose balances you still gain net interest income because of the rate differential so it should be positive at least through the next couple of raises and then longer term is whatever longer term is so manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i guess a followup to that is what the rate sensitivity the million will look like for the next basis points right because presumably were going to get several rate hikes in short order presumably by the time we get to june july well be talking about the next basis points so any thoughts on what that million should look like just based on your comments im assuming we need to haircut that a little bit but would love your thoughts on that paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think what most people are assuming is that the incremental benefits with incremental rate hikes are going to decline significantly still be a benefit netnet but decline relative to the first basis points as the lag catches up and the deposit betas increase but again if were guessing on the first basis points then were certainly going to be guessing on the second basis points so time will tell manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and just one quick clarification and sorry if i missed this earlier but can you quantify if there was any material hits to aoci this quarter raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i would certainly i dont think i would call it material you saw that our equity balance sheet equity was flat during the quarter despite strong earnings net of dividends so i think the aoci impact was somewhere around million for the quarter and thats again a testament to our aversion to taking too much duration risk we keep that securities portfolio very short and were actually shortening it now were buying treasuries now with sort of twoyear lifes today just to position ourselves as paul said to give us even more flexibility going forward given all the uncertainty around rates manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so much operator thank you well get to our next question on the line its from bill katz with citigroup go right ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking the questions this morning and your prepared commentary just coming back to capital for a moment so paul if i hear you correctly some of the sort of the pressure on the tier leverage ratio sequentially probably abates a little bit just given how client cash will move around a little bit and you obviously get the favorable impact from higher rates and notwithstanding a flat investment banking outlook and the deal with tsc you mentioned maybe some caution around buyback sort of curious why that would be the case at this point in time given what should be pretty fat capital ratios net of everything paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah the only cautionary isnt backing out of our plan to buy back the tsc purchase price its just were in a very uncertain economic environment and if things tanked wed have to look at if the market really tanked and no telling what happens or if the geopolitical thing really heightens and becomes global well be more cautious and more on pace now if the price if that happen and stock prices were affected well probably still be able to accomplish it but were just we always look at the macro outlook number one for us is safety and flexibility and secondary is execution so it was nothing more than a broad cautionary in a world that anything can go right now in the worst case as we take a look at it but this capital and liquidity stay number one but we still plan to execute that buyback all things being paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc predictable paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 and maybe the one thing i would add to that is whether we buy back that stock in one or two quarters following our closing or three to four quarters following closing it seems like a long time in the models but for us its a blip we make decisions for the next three to five years not for the next three to five quarters and the timing of the buybacks really doesnt impact results all that much a year to two years out so if it makes more sense given all the factors that paul just described to wait a couple of quarters then well wait a couple of quarters were going to err on the side of caution just as we always do william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you and then maybe just a twopart unrelated question i apologize for nesting it this way but on the pl communications had a pretty big sequential step up and i think business development similarly had a pretty flat against relative to sort of good organic growth any geography changes here any impact from charles stanley that you can help us maybe unpack a little bit paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah you nailed it its really a lot of the impact from charles stanley they had around million of total expenses reflected in the quarter since they closed and a portion a big portion of that hit the communication information processing line so i think thats what youre really seeing there is just the impact from the two months of charles stanley acquisition and some of those line items william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and then just the related question is i sort of appreciate were all trying to get at the pretax margin discussion but as you look at your core business today i think one of the themes youve talked about is youve been spending pretty regularly now over the last couple of years to sort of build the scale and the opportunity set is there anything in the core businesses that youve been underinvesting in and id be curious would you be willing to change the payout grid on the private client side to accelerate growth even more or a sort of a blended payout is a reasonable thought process from here thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well i think weve spent well on our infrastructure and its very leverageable the systems that weve put in and all of the back office have been a significant investment we have increased our technology run rate again this year so well continue to invest in technology as we move all of our systems forward and the next big investment is really around our client apps because weve felt that weve gotten more work to do but a leading the leading wealth planning desktop so now were putting that same technology to the client app so the advisor and client have that same intimacy but outside of that no i think were wellinvested were not really looking at anything and weve invested now i mean people asked if were ever going to acquire anything and weve got three in the hopper one closed and two hopefully to close soon so weve got a lot going on and we think weve been investing well across the firm and believe in the longterm growth will be great with these acquisitions they werent focused on shortterm growth although once integrated i think theyll do very well william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 thank you very much paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks bill paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks bill operator well now proceed to our next question on the line from kyle voigt from kbw go right ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning maybe just getting some clarity on the pcg asset management revenues and the guidance of that being likely down or so in fiscal i guess were seeing those feebased assets essentially flat over the past two quarters and i understand thats really due to adding the charles stanley assets so organically theyre down i guess the question is i guess where are those charles stanley revenues coming through in that segment then because given what you said it would imply that none of those revenue is really coming through that asset management line paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think its just a function of timing kyle so we did have those revenues coming through those lines for just over two months of the quarter but the assets werent really reflected until the end of the quarter so all were saying is that despite the assets appearing being flat sequentially those revenues will decline somewhere around starting next quarter because we already have accounting for those revenues at least two months of it so far this quarter kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks and then just given how yields trended through the first or through the calendar first quarter just wondering if you had any details regarding how has the afs portfolio trended in the quarter so maybe anything on endofperiod afs balances would be helpful and i guess do you view the securities reinvestment rates right now as attractive enough to really start moving some of those cip deposits into the bank to ramp up growth in that securities portfolio more meaningfully paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc were doing that modestly i mean the weve shortening the duration with treasuries to two years from the three to four years that we were buying in the agency mortgage back and the incremental spread on what were buying versus whats running off from the legacy portfolio is just north of so we think its somewhat attractive i mean that comes with duration and we want to stay flexible as paul pointed out before so were not going to do that in a dramatic way but we do have a lot of cash and cip that is invested in very shortterm treasuries in the to 60day treasuries and so to the extent that we can deploy some of that incrementally into the bank to earn a higher yield and sort of wait until this demand from thirdparty banks recover then we think that that would raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 be a good tradeoff but its not going to be too significant i would say in terms of growth of the securities portfolio but we do expect ongoing growth between now and the end of the fiscal year kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then just a followup question on that one is that cip is now setting out billion in balances is there a certain percentage of those balances we should think about you wanting to migrate and deploy in the bank versus moving off balance sheet to free up capital given what you just said is it fair to think about a majority of those you really want to move offbalance sheet into the thirdparty sweep paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i guess we dont have any sort of predetermined objectives in terms of where it goes we think that theres we know that about billion of those balances are billion today because they have declined by a couple of billion so far in april due to fee billings and tax payments is sort of what we consider our overflow balances that would prefer fdic insurance when capacity recovers for that with thirdparty banks andor when raymond james bank needs that capacity as well so over time we would expect somewhere around billion or north of billion of that to get redeployed from cip to thirdparty banks raymond james bank or redeployed into higher yielding alternatives for clients kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator thank you very much well get to our next question on the line from devin ryan from jmp securities go right ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey good morning guys how are you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc apologies i hopped on a minute late and i know theres been a lot of questions around your pretax margin and expenses i dont think you hit this yet im just trying to think about just the comp ratio and i appreciate were going to hit a lot more details on may but when we look back a couple of years ago comp ratio when rates were more call it normalized without making a call on capital markets and kind of considering a few raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 of the small acquisitions youve done i just want to think about maybe whats structurally different today a lot of conversation in the market around expense inflation and higher base salaries and base overall compensation so is that meaningful to change kind of the narrative of the comp ratio or the mix being so different that it changes kind of the way we should be thinking about comp going forward in the structure relative to prior period of kind of more normalized rate environment paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so this quarters comp ratio wasnt a surprise to us given capital markets were down and given that a lot of our fico and other stuff hits this quarter which has always been elevated so we felt that was certainly in line and certainly weve had a rate rise but it really didnt come through the quarter it was at the end of the quarter so as rates go up those comp ratios will go down because theyre noncompensable theyll be pretty significant and again capital markets if it recovers from the pace it is itll drive it down also so were looking we feel pretty good about where its headed and the interest rate environment and we do see pressure our recruiting has actually been pretty good there is market pressure so my guess itll be a slight headwind for everyone but we dont see it being a significant number but were looking at that and looking at the adjustments and sensitive to people that arent in the top part of their payouts making sure theyre compensated so that they can kind of survive a highinflationary environment but so that would be on the other side somewhat but its going to be well outpaced by i think interest spreads and a more normalized return to capital markets devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc right okay thanks paul and then just one thinking about kind of the uk opportunity obviously with charles stanley now closed i appreciate its still very small for raymond james but can you remind us paul how youre thinking about the addressable market in the uk for the firm and whether youre having dialogue with other firms there i know you were talking to charles stanley for some time and knew them well so are there more opportunities like that how should we think about the expansion in the uk organic versus inorganic and really i guess the thought is does charles stanley now having that kind of deal not necessarily behind you but completed does that set you up for more deals in the region paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so strategically its a very fragmented market with charles stanley i think it puts us close to the top just outside and so we think theres a lot of opportunity charles stanley really has highquality people highquality backoffice and but theyve been slower on growth mainly because theyve been more capital constrained weve had a much smaller but a much quicker growing probably an industryleading growth in terms of inorganic recruiting in the uk market so we hope the combination that we can between their support our capital and our ability to recruit and grow hopefully to combine the best of all those worlds now its going to take a while to integrate that right i mean were close but weve got to we know we have a yearlong project just to look at systems integration bestofclass making sure that we as always our focus is first retention weve had a we dont want to mess up our consecutive series of integrations where weve kept the people and part of that is were very very thoughtful on how we put things together we dont slam them together we havent assumed anybody or any system was going to come out on top and theyre doing both raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 teams on both sides i think a great job of looking at that and then we will integrate the system so itll take a while to gear that up but we think both so were not going to look at any acquisitions during that integration period but after its integrated up and running and we get it running as wed like to theres i think there are opportunities in that market and you can see that rbc entered the market with an acquisition so i think others see that opportunity too and but its going to take a little while to integrate it is i guess the bottom line but were very optimistic and really like the people devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah okay thats great one last one here just on the capital markets side of business or i guess the institutional side the ma pipelines are strong as i heard you guys have a pretty diverse focus there which maybe insulates more from volatility in other parts of the market i guess what are you guys seeing in terms of closure rates how much are deals getting pushed out and then new deals filling back in into the pipeline just trying to think about kind of the push and pull in that business i appreciate that it can change to the extent markets remain volatile or vice versa but just the comfort in kind of the i dont know the next months for the ma advisory business coming off of obviously a great prior months paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so comfort is a hard word to use in this environment right now we think at this run rate even in this environment we can continue but certainly theres a lot of upside what were seeing is most deals in pause not canceled in the pipeline we see new deals coming in and enter the pipeline so i would call strong maybe its more robust and weve had a very good pipeline and the problem is its been paused so part of that is a little bit market and market valuations certainly on the underwriting side but the ma side a little bit and then the uncertainties had people sit back and wait and making sure that with the political uncertainty globally that thats not really going to hurt the market so i would say right now its paused deals that are still in the pipeline now if theres if the geopolitical thing heats up you may some of those pause may turn to cancel or if the market really tanks but the market stays steady and people get more comfortable geopolitically i think theres a lot of upside too so its just hard to call because those are the two impacts devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah appreciate it okay ill leave it there thanks so much guys paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah thanks devin operator thank you very much well get to our next question on the line from jim mitchell with seaport research go right ahead raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning maybe just quickly on the reserve ratio i think youve bounced around to the last two quarters is that the right sort of target for you guys given the mix of loans right now and as we think about provisioning going forward try to stick to that level paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think that is given the mix of our assets seems reasonable that was roughly the percent that we saw in the provision this quarter but again were using cecl models so if macroeconomic james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc conditions deteriorate you could see provision increase and vice versa if macroeconomic conditions improve james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities was there any would cecl contribute in any way to this or was it just all growth paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc most of it was growth related as you saw we had really strong growth at the bank this quarter james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right and can you remind us what your betas were in the second basis points i appreciate theres you cant predict it but maybe in the last cycle what the betas were in the second basis points paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah if my memory serves me correctly i think were closer as an industry to the range for the last couple of increases as we got from to basis points on the fed funds target thats sort of what i recall off the top of my head james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay thats great all right thanks thanks for taking questions paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28apr2022 operator thank you very much and well proceed with our final question for today from the line of chris allen with compass point go right ahead chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc morning guys thanks for taking my question i think most of it has been covered i guess i want to quickly just follow up on the sumridge partners deal the press release makes it sound like an electronic marker maker im sorry market maker on electronic trading platforms but looking at their website it seems a bit more potentially advisorfacing so maybe give us some color there and whether this deal is more driven by the need for technology improvements on the fixed income trading side or whether theres other synergy opportunities moving forward paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think its a theres a lot of pieces to it first culturally and risk managementwise as weve been talking to them for quite some time we think theyre a great fit and what it adds strategically for us is the weakest part of our fixed income platform has been the corporate area were just versus our competitors were a lot smaller in the corporate bond area so they bring really great expertise there secondly they do have traderassisted technology where theyre able to sort and execute trades with a lot of analytics and we believe that that system can be migrated to other parts of our business too to help techenable the trading which is important their focus has really been on institutional clients although they do have an app with some advisoryfacing but its relatively small but we really like the app so we think it may be something we can convert to our to the advisory side of our business so theres lots of pieces we really like we really like the people the risk management and the technology we think can be really spread to lots of part of our fixed income business chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc got it thanks guys paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks chris paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well appreciate everyone coming on today i know its a crowded day i think that given our discipline that were really into a market with rising rates that well do really well we have plenty of capital to deploy even with our three acquisitions and well stay true as we always have to our guiding conservative principles but i think given i think were still in good shape to make all the commitments unless something weird happens in the market but if it does again with all of our capacity and flexibility i think relatively well be in good shape so appreciate you joining us and well talk to you next quarter
