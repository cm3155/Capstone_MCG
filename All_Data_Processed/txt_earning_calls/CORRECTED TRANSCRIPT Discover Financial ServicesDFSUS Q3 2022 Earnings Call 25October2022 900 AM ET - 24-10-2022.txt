director discover financial services thanks eric and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call im very pleased with our results this quarter against a fluid macroeconomic backdrop we generated strong financial performance while continuing to advance our strategic priorities lets start with a summary on slide for the third quarter we reported net income of billion after tax or per share over the past three months as fed policy has become more restrictive it has made fears of a recession more acute against this backdrop the key narratives of the third quarter results are the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our earnings our increase in revenues this year has been largely driven by our strong receivables growth with loans up yearoveryear this growth was driven largely by elevated sales volume and the increased number of new accounts weve added since mid2021 we continue to use a throughthecycle approach to underwriting which considers all stages of a credit cycle including downturns as part of our conservative credit management we marginally tightened our new account underwriting criteria this quarter given these factors we consider our growth to be consistent with current macroeconomic conditions discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 naturally discussion of a recession elicits concerns about credit quality but the credit performance of our loan portfolio at this stage does not suggest anything other than gradual normalization nonetheless a latecycle environment requires a particular awareness of changing conditions and underscores the importance of our strong financial condition we also continued to advance our strategic priorities as a few examples in august we expanded our global presence with the signing of woori card one of the largest issuers in south korea the extension of this relationship as well as the number of new network partnerships weve announced this year highlight our focus on expanding our international presence we continue to demonstrate the value of our network and our growing relationships with fintech partners as an example we announced in october that we will facilitate payments for tydeis new health care vendor management system which will digitize and streamline payments in an industry where legacy purchasing is still primarily manual finally this summer we announced the opening of our new advanced analytics resource center at our downtown chicago location the first cohort of individuals which we selected from over applicants has already started and we intend to grow the program with an additional cohort in this follows the grand opening of our customer care center in the southside neighborhood of chatham earlier this year and underscores our commitment to bring additional jobs to chicago while supporting great customer experiences ill now turn the call over to john to review our results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone ill start with our financial summary results on slide there were three important trends in the quarter strong asset growth net interest margin expansion and modest credit normalization the strength in asset growth combined with a nim rate improvement increased revenue sequentially and yearoveryear asset growth resulted in an increase in our reserves under cecl of million but our reserve coverage ratio declined slightly so while our reported net income was down yearoveryear adjusting for the reserve change our net income would have been higher on a yearoveryear basis lets review the details starting on slide net interest income was up million yearoveryear or driven by higher average receivables and improved net interest margin we achieved a record high nim rate of up basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially on both a yearoveryear and sequential basis the increase in net interest margin primarily reflects the higher prime rate partially offset by higher funding costs and increased promotional and balance transfers receivable growth was driven by card which increased yearoveryear reflecting continued strong sales and the contribution from new accounts growth last year and into this year sales growth was in the period a deceleration from the growth we experienced in the first half of the year as anticipated the sales decline was partially mitigated by a decrease in the payment rate which fell basis points in the quarter nonetheless it remains more than basis points over levels we expect payment rate to continue to decline through the back half of which should help support receivable growth discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 turning to our noncard products organic student loans increased as a result of peak season originations personal loans were up the growth reflects our disciplined approach to marketing underwriting and pricing of this product which we believe has created an attractive competitive position for us in the market particularly relative to some nonbank originators in terms of funding mix our customer deposit balances were up yearoveryear and sequentially so far deposit pricing has been in line with what we expected in a rising rate environment as we mentioned last quarter our strong asset growth has caused deposits to vary as a proportion of our funding mix but we continue to target to deposit funding over the mediumterm we also issued billion of card abs fixed notes in the quarter and booked billion of broker deposits we maintain broad access to a variety of funding sources enabling us to confidently fund our asset growth looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was partially due to a million loss on our equity investments in the prioryear quarter compared to a million loss this quarter adjusting for these our noninterest income was up this was driven by higher net discount and interchange revenue which was up million or reflecting strong sales and favorable sales mix partially offset by higher rewards costs similar to last quarter we estimate that inflation contributed between and basis points of sales growth in the period this strong sales also drove higher reward expense consistent with the prior quarter our rewards rate increased basis points yearoveryear driven by substantial growth in new accounts increasing the cost of our cashback program yeartodate our rewards rate is up basis points consistent with our expectation of to basis points of annual reward rate inflation moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear and up from the prior quarter compensation costs were up primarily due to increased head count our servicing organization is a key component of our value proposition we expect to grow this as our accounts and assets expand this will contribute to an increase in salary and wages through the end of this year and into next year marketing expenses increased million or as we continue to invest for growth in our card and consumer banking products we grew new card accounts by from last years third quarter professional fees increased million or as a result of investments in technology and increased consulting costs we also had additional fraud costs in the consumer bank driven by increased volumes as well as some legal expense elevating our other expense category in the quarter moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were or basis points higher than the prior year but down basis points from the prior quarter total net chargeoff dollars were up million from the prior year and only up million sequentially in the card portfolio the net chargeoff rate of was basis points higher than the prior year and basis points lower sequentially similar to our commentary from last quarter we are not seeing evidence of emerging credit stress beyond normal expected normalization discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 delinquencies among our lower prime segment have been normalized but in upper prime delinquencies and chargeoffs remain below prepandemic levels this is consistent with our baseline expectation that credit will continue to normalize over the next several quarters absent a change in macro conditions turning to the discussion of our allowance on slide this past quarter we increased our allowance by million due to higher receivable balances our reserve rate modestly declined to for us changes to employment conditions pose the most significant risk to loss levels as part of our reserving process we have considered the prospects of higher unemployment among a range of macroeconomic scenarios and is reflected in our reserve balance looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was the strong asset growth was a primary driver of the approximate basis point decline from the prior period our longterm target remains in terms of capital return we declared a quarterly common dividend of per share and repurchased million of common stock in the period before we decided to temporarily suspend our buyback activity concluding on slide as we look at the last quarter of the year our prospects for remain favorable and we are once again improving elements of our expectations we are revising our view on loan growth to highteens continued strong sales new account acquisitions through the third quarter and some recent improvements in the payment rates support our confidence in the outlook in terms of nim we expect the full year to be mildly above the high end of our expected range with sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter based on rate hikes that happened in lateseptember we are revising our expense outlook to be up highsingle digits versus the prior year driven by increased marketing and compensation costs in line with previous communications we still expect marketing costs to come in above levels as weve discussed we expect to add head count which will elevate salary and wages as well as benefit expense excluding these two categories expenses are expected to increase by lowsingle digits we now expect net chargeoffs to be between and for the full year driven by lowerthanexpected credit losses through this point in the year our temporary pause on share repurchases remains in place but we hope to resume share repurchases before yearend in summary receivable growth accelerated as we continue to benefit from elevated sales strong new account acquisitions and improvements in the payment rate nim continues to benefit from prime rate increases funding costs are consistent with expectations and credit performance is slowly normalizing reflecting our disciplined approach to underwriting and credit management these results demonstrate the resiliency of our integrated digital banking and payments model our earnings power coupled with our strong balance sheet and capital position keeps us wellpositioned for continued profitable growth through a range of economic conditions with that ill turn the call back to our operator katie to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you sir operator instructions well take our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe to start on the net interest margin john you commented that it implies another uptick given the rate hikes that we saw at the end of the quarter can you maybe just talk about where we go from here on the margin i think last quarter you talked about it potentially peaking out im just curious do you think you can continue to hold the line around these levels and maybe what is incorporated within that in terms of deposit betas and the like john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great okay thanks for the question ryan theres a lot there so let me start with the fundamentals that were seeing so the liability side of the balance sheet is certainly subjected to increases in deposit funding costs as a result of competitive actions and general needs across the market to attract some deposits with that said the 11plus percent we delivered in the third quarter we do expect some upside from that as a result of the fed hikes in september so certainly sequentially into the fourth quarter well see further improvement now beyond the excuse me into the fourth quarter well see improvement beyond the fourth quarter at this point were going to reserve any commentary but what i would say is we dont expect any specific ill say seismic changes to net interest margins in based on the stability of our funding base and the current access to multiple sources of funds ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 got it thanks for the color roger maybe one for you you mentioned you guys are marginally tightening on account acquisition can you maybe just give additional color regarding some of the changes youre making to underwriting and what do you think this might mean for growth over the intermediate term thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so i would start by saying in general it remains a very good environment were seeing cost per account on the prime side below what we had last year the value proposition is resonating well for the new account space at the margin we tightened some of those segments that will be most volatile in a downturn so i think the lower end of prime and are ready to take further action on new accounts or the portfolio side but again id say overall a very good environment and thats part of why youre seeing such strong growth ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc i appreciate the color operator thank you our next question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is now open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i was hoping maybe you could talk for a little bit of a different tack maybe talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what youre seeing from a credit standpoint and from a competitive marketing standpoint kind of in your new two installment loan businesses both in the personal loan business and the student loan business and maybe talk about that and the outlook there for a moment roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes so it is hard moshe to know what individual competitors are doing i would say in general most of them are much broader spectrum lenders than we are and so my guess is wed be seeing some stress at the lower ends of their books for us a rising rate environment creates a lot of focus on debt consolidation which is the primary use of our personal loans so were maintaining a very disciplined credit criteria but seeing strong originations in that segment moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks it is interesting i think weve seen that for others that are at the higher end of the credit spectrum where the stress youre talking about we do see at the lower end followup question that i had is you talked about hoping to restart the buyback by yearend or so a little bit growth kind of causing a basis point downtick in your capital but youre still well above just talk about i guess the appetite for that given and does the kind of macro environment figure into that just talk about the appetite for the buyback once that restarts thanks discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah sure hi moshe ill take that so from an overall capital level we are very well capitalized right so were approaching on the cet1 our target is the credit book has been very very stable its normalizing but overall very very stable so the capital allocation priorities for the firm remain in place so first is to invest in strong organic growth second would be a return of capital and then third perhaps a bolton acquisition and if were going to do that itll likely be in the payments segment so overall those priorities didnt change so the suspension remains in place but were hopeful that it will resume buybacks will resume here in the fourth quarter moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john i wanted to just walk through the expense guide increase you mentioned its a blend of marketing and comp costs could you just parse apart what part is how much of each sort of contributed to the increase and im just trying to put the marketing comments to slightly pulling back the credit box and then as far as like the head count increases was that related to the growth im just trying to figure out what changed in terms of the comp cost john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah yeah happy to help with that sanjay so let me provide some context upfront here so yeartodate total expenses are up comp expense is up and excluding marketing our expense base yeartodate is up so actually really really what ill say first half of the year and into this quarter some strong fundamentals now we did have a significant growth in the asset base which of course means that there are accounts that were going to have to service and you might have seen a press release that came out that indicated we were hiring about servicing agents through the balance of this year and into next year depending on the balance sheet and our customer value proposition and metrics so overall the strong growth and the strong acquisition has necessitated investments in our people well continue to do that weve also made specific investments in information technology specifically around resources advanced analytics in order to further position us to be able to grow profitably and then also enhance underwriting and customer targeting discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 so we believe all those investments make perfect sense for the longterm and what youre seeing here in the third quarter is a combination of what ill say is a tough comp as a result of some turnover last year and then us coming on with backfilling resources what ill say is salaried resources as well as the investments i talked about in terms of customer service so hopefully that provides some context and color to your question sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats very helpful and then i know were trying to read between the lines in terms of the student loan servicing inquiry or investigation thats going on but just to be clear there is no change to how you guys are thinking about it relative to last quarter and as far as the expenses are concerned it seems like things are progressing as you expected it to and its just a matter of timing is that a correct statement john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah that is a correct statement so no change obviously when we have some news to share were going to share it the expense guidance we provided and the updates reflect those items i discussed on your previous question and no specific changes related to expenses related to the buybacks as mentioned sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator thank you our next question will come from john hecht with jefferies your line is now open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys actually most of my questions have been asked and i was going to ask one about marketing but maybe since you addressed the spend patterns maybe can you talk about just because its a topic that we havent really talked about in detail recently your perspective on rewards and the competitive environment around rewards and what that means for the intermediate term roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah sure so a lot of the most intense competition on rewards is in the super prime segment and weve talked over the last year or two how we think some of the propositions issuers are putting out arent necessarily sustainable in the long run as john mentioned our rewards costs are moving up exactly as we forecast we havent felt the need to make any structural changes to our program so as you can see from the growth in the new accounts our value proposition competes very well in that prime revolver segment and so while the market is always competitive we bring a differentiated value proposition that resonates well with consumers john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay and then second question is maybe thinking about like a cohort and i know its probably early for the cohort but what can you tell us in terms of how theyre seasoning utilization rates and kind of delinquency discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 seasoning is there is it back to what it looked like in or is there something different thats worth pointing out with respect to more recent vintages roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i would say more recent vintages are performing exactly in line with our expectations right every vintage got distorted during the pandemic so you saw it cut across the curves but again we feel very good about the performance john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you guys operator thank you our next question will come from john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi the efficiency ratio came in around for the third quarter and just given the commentary that you gave around the investments that youre making and your expense expectations can you maybe help us think about how that could shape up for the fourth quarter and more importantly into how we could think about the trajectory there thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah john thanks for the question so what we said in the past and what weve told our board and what were targeting is an efficiency ratio in the high and through this year weve done a pretty good job in terms of being able to deliver that certainly the really strong growth and the great performance through the first half on the expense base and then the third quarter reflects some investments and despite those investments still below were going to continue to make investments where we see an opportunity to drive great returns for our shareholders and as we approach we are aware that the economic environment is a little tougher we do feel like we have remaining tailwinds in terms of asset growth and we do have investments were going to continue to make so i would say for specifically we will come out in january to give more specific details discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 but the overall commitments remain in place a commitment to positive operating leverage an efficiency ratio south of and expense discipline while investing for growth john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you thats helpful and then on the reserve front just wanted to get your take on how you see that trajecting here i know you allowed the reserve to bleed a bit in terms of the ratio this quarter but now as youre seeing some of the normalization that you indicated and some of the pressure on delinquencies how should we think about the reserve as you look here particularly as you factor in the economic conditions and how youre looking at the economy the impact on the economy plays out thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah great yeah thanks for that question so a little bit of context there so we put on about billion to billion worth of assets in the quarter our reserves increased by million so as we look at the portfolio and the macroenvironment were seeing the portfolio continuing to be very very stable but normalizing the macroenvironment indications of a recession are certainly increasing roger mentioned in his comments about some mild in his comments about some mild tightening so in terms of expectation around reserves well continue to take a look at the macros well run multiple scenarios and then make sure the balance sheet the portfolio specifically continues to perform as anticipated and well make appropriate calls for reserves under gaap its really tough to give any specific guidance on that other than were going to be mindful of the macros continue to watch the portfolio and that prime revolver targeting we do tends to add highlevel stability a matter of fact one other point that may be useful not specific to reserves but rather chargeoffs you have to go all the way back to the second quarter of to see a chargeoff rate that is north of so were seeing great stability this year and we expect it to be stable next year as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks for taking the question operator thank you our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services morning discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to see if i could get you to unpack your statement on no seismic changes in maybe we could speak a little bit about how youre thinking and i know you just detailed a little bit but how youre thinking about how the loan yield should traject i know in the slide deck you called out that the loan yield was driven by prime obviously but with partial offset from higher promotional mix and the timing of pricing changes could you help us understand how that works how much the promo mix and the timing impacted loan yields and how youre thinking about that trajecting as we continue to go through a fed rate hike period here john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay yeah so theres a lot there and as you know its fairly complex betsy but ill do my best to create some transparency here and let me start with the loan yields so of our book is floating rate of the asset side so as the fed increases that creates the opportunity to move the contract rate up with the fed changes and correspondingly if the fed were to come down the contract rate would come down so what were seeing there is in a rising rate environment we still expect to basis points of yield improvement so net interest margin yield improvement over a 12month period so we saw significant increases in september it looks like based on the forward curve theres another maybe as much as basis points of further fed action this year and then next year depending on the economy there could be a couple more or therell be a pause i dont think there will be much in the way of fed rate reductions until maybe as late as so what that means is were going to get the benefit from the fed rate increases into the portfolio were seeing deposit pricing continue to go up we havent been a price leader on that certainly weve been a follower to make sure we have a positive value proposition for our customer base and then the next question would be around betas and what do you think about betas so im going to try to address that right now so as theres greater disparity between our rates from a deposit standpoint and the brickandmortar banks it creates plenty of opportunity for us to market into those customers and theyll find an attractive value proposition which should help dampen the impact of further rate increases so we do think the combination of the fed increases us being able to manage the deposit book but in a rising rate environment stability from a credit standpoint but normalization which will create a bit of incremental interest reversals impacting net interest margin and then ultimately the pricing decisions were going to make where we have that flexibility to make sure were making good decisions for our customers and for our shareholders so ultimately it nets out that we expect relative stability over net interest margin through betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it no appreciate that thanks my followup has to do with the buyback discussion that we had earlier and i know you mentioned that youre hopeful it can resume in would you expect to put out an 8k that indicates that you can now resume buybacks or would we hear about buybacks only after youd started theres no obligation to put a notification into the market that you can resume thanks discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services correct there isnt an obligation but we would likely put an 8k out betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay no obligation but you would likely do it okay thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes operator thank you our next question will come from robert napoli with william blair your line is now open robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you and good morning so just following up on it was good to hear resuming the buybacks i guess that would suggest that the review is behind you but would you expect them to get your to go towards your target capital ratio and over what timeframe would you like to do that or what kind of a buffer do you want above that john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes hey bob thanks for the question i just want to be very specific about something you said and our comments have consistently been here on this call that we hope to resume the buyback in the fourth quarter so we say that because were hopeful but theres ultimately it will be a decision that the board helps with so in terms of the target so weve been well north of that for quite some time theres we have said that we want to step towards that we intend to step towards that so certainly the earnings power that the firm has generated and the buybacks as well as dividends have impacted our ability to get there so were going to step towards that throughout and what we said previously is we hope to be around the target sometime in or robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and the followup just on normalization of credit losses as we think about normalized credit losses looking back over history credit cards high i guess or mid to high personal loans in the range is that the way we should think is there anything thats changed should we continue to think about normalized credit losses in that kind of an area john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah yeah so i would put two points out there first i would take a look at the historical trends and use that and make certain judgments discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 the other item here im going to say is a matter of judgment but certainly i have a belief that credit cards have increased in the payment priority because folks can access the digital economy without a credit card some folks with a debit card but most specifically around a credit card so that i believe helps prioritize the primary credit card among many other debt obligations that a consumer has so could that impact the relative chargeoff rates versus the historical trend my belief is yes but your judgment is what id say you should apply when youre working through your forwardlooking outlook robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is now open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc john personal loan growth was pretty strong this quarter just wanted to get your thoughts on the outlook there and growth and also any updates on your home equity lending initiative john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services 3yeah thanks for the question don so certainly nice growth there on the personal loan front you go back a few quarters and it was flat and we said it was flat to down actually if you go back three or four quarters as a result of some underwriting decisions we took weve been weve seen strength in the underwriting for that product and its given us greater confidence to be able to market that product and theres been a high level of appeal to it so well continue to be mindful of the product in the face of a tougher economic condition but certainly we feel like its a good product and its meeting customer needs and thats helped drive the growth in terms of kind of forwardlooking guidance im not going to start to do that at a product level all it would do is ensure that i was wrong more often but if i go to the kind of the home equity loan that portfolio is relatively small so its actually not moving the dial at this point from an earnings standpoint but what weve seen is a great level of interest in the second lien product and were also originating a first lien product as well so both products are performing well and nice appeal donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks operator thank you our next question will come from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is now open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning thank you for taking my question maybe i just wanted to start with if we just take your guidance for nim and loan growth and i think that works out about effectively works out a fourth quarter nim of at least and billion plus nii is that the right way to think about it and frame the exit rate for nim and then should nii just increase from there given loan growth and your comments about nim stability am i thinking of that correctly john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so mihir thanks for the question and i certainly appreciate the specificity what ive said about nim is probably as far as im going to go here on this call we do expect sequential improvement as i said beyond that it will be tough to give specific details mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay and then just wanted to ask about losses normalizing i know previously you had talked about it being in is when we get to a more normalized loss rate but i think there was talk that it could maybe push into even later any update on that thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so normalization through and the macro environment will help us determine whether it pushes into but where were sitting today were very pleased with the portfolio performance and the only surprise is frankly the pace of normalization on the upper end is a little slower than we expected which helped drive the improved guidance that we gave on the chargeoff rate mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you operator thank you our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is now open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everyone for taking my question look your customer base really represents a great sample of the domestic population im curious when you look at spending on a category level basis if theres anything that youre seeing that is a cause for concern not asking are people spending more at the pump thats obvious with the inflationary pressures but are there categories where youre seeing people use their cards that are signals for something we should be thinking about roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah great question so our base probably does skew a little upwards so more in the prime but were seeing continued strength in sales in october so id say yearoveryear in the lowteens some of the trends youve discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 heard about were picking up so consumer durables softening in terms of yearoveryear but again our households by and large they have the liquidity to absorb inflation it causes some pain and well switch categories well downgrade within a category but i would say travel is coming off some of the very very strong growth we saw over the summer so a little less strength in travel and consumer durables are probably the key trend richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you very much operator thank you our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning roger and john roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc you mentioned that operating conditions are consistent with late cycle expansion historically fed hiking cycles have typically ended in slowing loan growth but your already exceptionally strong loan growth seems to be accelerating and certainly the whole industry is enjoying strong growth can you share any thoughts around how youd expect the late cycle expansion to end and ill just layer in my followup now and if you can give any commentary around what level of unemployment is implicit in your reserve rate and what a change in unemployment would mean for the reserve rate that would be very helpful roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yes so great question so in terms of late cycle i think back prepandemic we talked about it being late cycle for a couple years and then it ended in a way that i think no one expected and so thats part of why we tend to use a throughthecycle loss rate and look to be disciplined in our credit management so while i would agree its not a time probably to be widening credit were seeing a lot of benefits from the investments in advanced analytics in particular around the personal loan product and on the card side where the growth were achieving the growth while swapping in and swapping out different populations and again with a policy that i think is appropriate for late cycle and it builds on some of the really strong new account production we had in as those accounts mature discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 so again well continue to look at it both in terms of our portfolio actions as well as new account originations across all of our products but we feel good about the credit approach and just the traction our products are getting in the marketplace and ill pass it to john for part john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah hey bill and in terms of kind of fundamental assumptions for kind of reserve setting so as i said earlier we used a number different scenarios which included kind of nonrecession scenario as well as a recessionary scenario the recessionary scenario that we modeled we certainly didnt weight as much as the nonrecession and also the view in terms of the unemployment rate theres pretty wide range right now right so some forecast it going north of in a very what ill say a dark scenario the more optimistic scenario is and so we looked at a complete range of scenarios and weighted it more towards stability with increasing unemployment gdp not as big a driver but certainly an indication for the economy today were at about and in in a recessionary scenario thered be mild contraction not deep contraction so we think overall there will be general stability despite a tougher macro bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is now open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you and thank you concerning the comments regarding unemployment rate maybe some slight tightening on underwriting that being said are you seeing any minor shifts in consumer spending or payment patterns that may indicate certain pockets of stress whether its the lower end of prime or other parts or maybe even certain vintages of customers that are on your books roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah all the vintages are performing well as john said i think were seeing the normalization occur faster and pretty close to fully normalized for the lower end of prime while the payment rate has softened a bit and come down by about basis points it remains basis points higher than levels and so i think that speaks to the fact that theres still a very strong employment market out there people can find jobs can find extra hours and so a good amount of liquidity that is supporting the indiscernible for our segment kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay and then i know its a fluid situation but the student debt repayment is supposed to restart here maybe early next year who knows given whats happening with the fighting in the courts but do you expect any incremental impact to credit with a lot of the student debt payments obviously theres the forgiveness is discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 obviously a credit positive but is there something that you could see as a potential headwind as student debt repayments restart here potentially in january roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services not necessarily weve watched it closely i think we have experienced an elevated payment rate which has a dampening impact on loan growth as students have put more of their payments towards their private student loans but we dont see anything that would have a significant impact on credit kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you for taking my questions operator thank you our next question will come from mark devries with barclays your line is now open mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks how should we think about how you manage expense discipline if we start to see some revenue and credit weakness if the economy softens here john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah i would just simply say that we will take a look at the opportunities we have in front of us and well make what i hope will be great longterm decisions for our shareholders and were going to be very very mindful around discretionary spending and around employment decisions so overall we hope were good stewards of the company mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it and then just given where the rewards cost has trended so far this year and the guidance i think you said it was basis points but guidance is basis points to basis points is it right to assume that is a relatively big quarter for expenses maybe youve got more of the categories this quarter john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah i wouldnt necessarily assume that what the point of the guidance between basis points and basis points is thats what we had said previously still within the range and we wanted to keep it within the range so that basis points to basis points is something that weve seen historically and to an extent managed to and well continue to do that so i wouldnt lean on any particular information to assume the fourth quarter is going to be extraordinarily high or low mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 operator thank you our next question will come from bill ryan with seaport research partners your line is now open william ryan q analyst seaport research partners thanks good morning and a couple of quick questions just following up on the personal loans business historically its been heavily focused on your credit card base and i was just wondering if thats still the case and you also had id say very very strong credit checks in that business paying off creditors directly has anything changed there as well roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services no so i would say its pretty balanced in terms of crosssold to the card base versus broad market probably the biggest change has been just the continued advancement in analytics and the underwriting approach there but very very conservative so a lot of employment verification et cetera heavily manual processes just to make sure we get it right because as opposed to the card business where you can manage credit as you go you get one shot in personal loans but again i would say the performance remains very very strong there and a lot of it thanks to that disciplined approach william ryan q analyst seaport research partners okay and just one followup on the promotional balances thats kind of been borne up on the card book for the last several quarters is it still increasing as a percentage of the overall card portfolio or is it kind of stabilized and maybe give us some historical perspective of where it stands to recent history thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks its stabilized in the third quarter basically approached stabilization into the second quarter and its very close to where it has been historically william ryan q analyst seaport research partners okay thanks for taking my questions john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome operator thank you our next question will come from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is now open dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey thanks so much for taking my questions throughout the call and throughout other calls youve kind of laid out your playbook in pieces in particular on the credit side for a slowing economy but maybe roger you can discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 25oct2022 just provide us with a more holistic idea of what discover would change across various pieces of the businesses to protect profitability in a tougher economic environment and then i just have a followup thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah id start by saying we dont necessarily optimize on protecting profitability on a quarterbyquarter basis we focus on sort of delivering longterm value to the shareholders and i think as ive been in this business a while people who just totally gut marketing in a downturn miss out on what usually turn out to be some of the most profitable vintages and so yeah you cut marketing mainly because as you tighten the credit box there are fewer and fewer people to market to but i think we try and operate our company almost like were always in a recession always be conservative on credit always be tight on expenses theres more you can do especially around discretionary items but that ability to keep momentum through a downturn has really distinguished us in previous cycles and we would try and do that again dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc okay great thank you and i think itd be really helpful to understand what your both of your views are on the normalization of the personal loan portfolio net chargeoffs versus the credit card portfolio consensus has such a huge ramp on the personal loan side versus credit cards for not looking for specific guidance but is there any reason why there would be such a difference in faster normalization on the personal loan side versus credit card as far as basis point movement as a percentage of loans thanks so much guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah we havent put out productbyproduct guidance but i would say that given how we underwrite the personal loans im not sure why our portfolio would jump much faster than the card book in general we have a higher fico for the personal loans business they do tend to be a little more volatile than card in a recession but i wouldnt that isnt necessarily a behavior i would expect dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks so much operator thank you eric wasserstrom vice president corporate strategy investor relations discover financial services all right well thank you everyone for joining us and thank you katie and if
