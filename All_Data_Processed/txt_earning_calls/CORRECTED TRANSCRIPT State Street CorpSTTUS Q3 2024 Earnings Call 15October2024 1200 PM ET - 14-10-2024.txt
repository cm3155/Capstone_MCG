chief executive officer state street corp thank you liz and good afternoon everyone our third quarter results which we released earlier this morning demonstrate the accelerating financial performance and strong business momentum we are achieving this year which in turn positions state street well for future growth we achieved robust fee and total revenue growth and generated positive fee and total operating leverage in which when combined with increased capital return quarteronquarter drove strong earnings growth for our shareholders on both a yearoveryear and sequential basis with quarterly eps reaching the highest on record in addition to strong results our yeartodate results also highlight the strength of our franchise and financial performance three quarters of the way through the year with solid fee and total revenue growth and good expense discipline driving better than expected positive fee and positive total operating leverage as well as strong earnings growth relative to the same period in and excluding notable items the operating environment in the third quarter was dynamic while global equity and fixed income markets moved notably higher the worlds investors faced a number of riskoff events in including fears of a us recession the unwinding of the carry trade concerns over tech valuations and continued geopolitical tensions these events drove bouts of negative market sentiment and significant market volatility however these market dislocations proved to be shortlived with markets taking comfort from a host of subsequently dovish central bank pivots including the first rate cut from the federal reserve in four years as well as improved economic data in the us we supported clients and navigated wealth through this market backdrop delivering strong business and financial performance we remained laser focused on successfully executing against our key strategic priorities to drive better results which i will now discuss turning to slide of our investor presentation our third quarter eps was as compared to in the year ago period excluding notable items we delivered strong earnings growth of yearoveryear with record quarterly eps while roe was a strong relative to the yearago quarter and excluding notable items fee and total revenue growth was robust at and respectively and in turn driving margin expansion all areas of our business contributed to this yearoveryear revenue growth and nii was significantly higher q3 servicing fees increased yearoveryear and we are pleased by the sales momentum we continue to see within the investment services business as we execute well against the sharpened strategy that we outlined last year at the same time expenses remained well controlled despite increases in revenuerelated costs we continue to drive transformation and productivity savings which are funding significant investments in our business each year as a result while expenses increased by yearoveryear on a yeartodate basis expenses increased by just excluding notable items relative to the same period in state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 turning to our business momentum which you can see in the middle of the slide we achieved a great deal in the third quarter our business performance indicators including wins clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy in positioning state street to support our clients compete better and gain share within investment services in we generated strong auca wins of billion with new servicing fee revenue wins of million the highest quarter this year provided another clear demonstration of the power of state street alpha which brings together the full depth and breadth of our servicing and software solutions alpha is a clear competitive advantage which strategically positions us to retain business at even higher levels win new longterm relationships and as evidenced this quarter deepen existing relationships in a meaningful way we reported two new alpha mandates in with alpha accounting for the vast majority of our auca wins this quarter as state street was awarded a significant mandate by a premier large global asset manager this win illustrates the compelling value proposition of our fronttoback solution for clients what started as a front office charles river client will now extend to include a host of middle and back office services including custody all underpinned by our alpha data platform and data services we are also very pleased with the momentum at global advisors this quarter our cash etf and institutional businesses all had positive net flows including record quarterly flows in cash and strong etf flows in aggregate quarterly total net flows of billion and quarterend assets under management of trillion both reached record levels in importantly we expanded our market share in a number of key product areas and geographies for example we improved our institutional money market fund rank this quarter while spdr also gained share in both us low cost and commodities as well as in the emea region we also continued to innovate and strategically expand global advisors capabilities and client solutions for example global advisors launched new etfs in including three actively managed digital assetfocused etfs we also announced a new relationship with apollo global management that will aim to expand investor access to private market opportunities turning to our markets businesses stronger client volumes in both fx trading services and securities finance helped to drive revenues higher both sequentially and yearoveryear i was particularly pleased to see state street named as a leader in the four categories by euromoney magazine in its fx awards including the worlds best fx bank for client service as well as research which underscores the value clients place in our markets franchise turning to our balance sheet our yearoveryear nii performance was strong as a number of targeted management actions over the last year have helped to support nii growth our balance sheet is solid enabling over million of capital return in including million of share repurchases as we look ahead we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the fourth quarter subject to market conditions and other factors before i turn it over to eric we also announced this morning that eric will be leaving state street to pursue a new opportunity outside of banking we have commenced a formal search process to identify his replacement and eric will stay on with us through midfebruary to support us through this transition i and the team have been fortunate to work closely with eric over the last eight years personally i have enjoyed and valued our partnership and want to thank eric for his leadership and wish him well in his new role state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 with that let me hand the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron before we get into the numbers i want to say that it has been a privilege to have been here at state street and have worked with you and the team im proud of all that weve accomplished together over the past eight years and its with mixed feelings that im moving on but i know that the progress will continue and that state street is well positioned with a strong financial foundation and strategy for success and i look forward to working with the team into during the transition now let me walk everyone through our results for the third quarter starting on slide we reported record eps of for the third quarter which included notable revenue items that in aggregate were neutral to earnings and are detailed on the right side of the page you can see that we took the opportunity to do some additional repositioning of the investment portfolio this quarter which ill talk more about in a moment we delivered robust eps growth of yearonyear excluding notable items reflecting broadbased fee growth higher nii and continued capital return which increased on a sequential quarter basis our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half of the year as healthy fee and total revenue growth coupled with expense discipline delivered both positive fee and positive total operating leverage excluding notable items in the quarter and on a yeartodate basis the quarter clearly demonstrates good margins and returns with pretax margin at almost an roe of and a return on tangible common equity of over turning now to slide the third quarter period end auca and aum again increased to record levels supported by both equity and bond market tailwinds as well as strong client flows as you can see on the right panel of the slide after an eventful third quarter the various external indicators for our markets businesses were mixed that said we were encouraged by the continued growth in client volumes and balances across our fx trading and securities finance businesses which ill discuss more in detail shortly turning to slide third quarter servicing fees increased yearonyear as higher average market levels and new business were partially offset by pricing headwinds a previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity including an asset mix shift the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately percentage points to yearonyear growth while lower client activity including an asset mix shift into cash was a headwind of approximately percentage point to yearonyear growth which seems to be abating somewhat we do feel we we do feel good about servicing fee momentum going into the fourth quarter encouragingly we generated million of revenue wins in the quarter the majority of which were driven by back office mandates in line with our strategic focus over the past four quarters weve achieved nearly million of servicing fee revenue wins moving to slide third quarter management fees increased yearonyear primarily reflecting higher average market levels as well as record quarterly net flows with positive inflows across all three major product lines we gained market share within our cash business due to strong investment performance and expanded distribution as well as in etfs where our strategic repricing initiative contributed to the strong flow performance and continued etf market share gains taken together our investment management business demonstrated strong growth in the quarter while also generating a healthy pretax margin of approximately up over percentage points yearonyear importantly state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 as ron mentioned earlier we continued to position global advisors for success by further expanding its capabilities in client solutions and meeting the evolving needs of investors in key growth areas such as digital assets private markets and innovative fixed income solutions now turning to slide as i noted this quarter we were pleased to see continued growth in our markets businesses with higher volumes across nearly all of our fx venues relative to the yearago period fx trading revenue increased yearonyear excluding notable items driven by higher client volumes with particular strength in emerging markets securities finance revenues increased yearonyear reflecting higher agency lending balances and share gains with excellent performance in prime services as we put more balance sheet to work to support our clients moving on to software and processing fees revenues were up yearonyear mainly driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with crd which is described in greater detail on the following slide turning to slide our third quarter front office software revenues increased yearonyear with our software enabled and professional services revenues up a strong we are pleased with the robust growth weve consistently delivered in our software business with revenues up yeartodate this level of growth supports our belief that our software business has the potential to reach billion of revenue over the next five years and as ron noted we reported two additional alpha mandate wins in the quarter and we remain confident in achieving our goal of winning six to eight new alpha clients this year moving to slide third quarter nii increased yearonyear to million as higher investment security yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit rotation on a sequential basis nii was lower primarily driven by continued deposit rotation as well as by the impact of lower short term rates stemming from central bank actions this dynamic was partially offset by higher investment security yields as well as additional lending and sponsored repo activity the market dynamics for the sponsored repo product were constructive in the quarter as detailed on the right panel of this slide average investment portfolio balances increased both sequentially and yearonyear we also opportunistically repositioned a small portion of the book late in the quarter which has a payback of approximately five quarters benefiting nii over the next two years average deposits increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter as we continued to realize the benefits of our client engagement efforts as we move into wed expect to generally operate around these levels albeit with a bit of continued non interestbearing deposit rotation turning to slide yearonyear third quarter expense growth was primarily driven by higher performance based incentive compensation and revenuerelated costs which were worth about half of the increase as well as important investments in products technology and infrastructure we remain acutely focused on managing our cost base as demonstrated by yearonyear expense growth of just on a yeartoday basis excluding notable items as ron mentioned in the third quarter we continued to deliver productivity benefits through transformation of our operating model and other savings initiatives achieving roughly million of yearonyear savings through a variety of actions yeartodate we delivered roughly million of savings and were on track to achieve our productivity savings target of million this year state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 were continuing to benefit from our ongoing organizational simplification process improvements and automation initiatives which has enabled us to further improve service quality while also lowering our head count on a pro forma basis including the jv consolidations by yearonyear as detailed on the bottom left of this slide moving to slide as you can see our capital leverage and liquidity levels all remain very strong as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of increased from the prior quarter as capital generated from earnings combined with a benefit of lower rates on aoci more than offset increased capital return and rwa growth as we supported our clients as i just noted we delivered on our goal to accelerate capital return in the third quarter with common share repurchases of million up from million in the prior quarter and million in q1 but falling rate moves at the end of the quarter did create some unexpected excess capital in total we returned over million of capital to our shareholders this quarter equivalent to a total payout ratio of almost as we look ahead we are planning for another quarter of healthy capital return in q4 which we would expect to be somewhat higher than this quarter subject to market conditions and other factors as such we continue to expect the fullyear payout ratio for to be comfortably in the to range as we aim to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and supporting our clients with our balance sheet in summary were pleased with both our third quarter and yeartodate results which continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustainable business momentum while delivering positive fee and total operating leverage excluding notable items along with a significant return of capital to shareholders with that let me cover our improved fullyear outlook which is all on a yearonyear basis and ex notable basis i would highlight that the outlook continues to have the potential for significant variability given the economic and political environment were operating in in terms of our current macro assumptions were assuming global equity markets are flat to third quarter end for the remainder of the year our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve and we expect fx market volatility to remain relatively flat to the third quarter average levels for the remainder of the year given our strong results yearto date and higher average market levels we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be at or slightly above the high end of our up to range better than our prior expectations turning to nii we now expect fullyear nii will be up in the to range which is also better than our previous guide for nii to be up slightly on a fullyear basis finally given these improved top line revenue expectations expenses are expected to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook and now up in the range of this year given higher revenuerelated costs importantly we continue to expect to deliver both positive fee and positive total operating leverage for the full year and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you eric to conclude im pleased with how we have been able to deliver stronger financial performance so far this year we entered expecting roughly to fee revenue growth together with positive fee operating leverage while nii was expected to be a headwind to our financial results on a full year basis state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 however with successful execution against our strategic and client engagement priorities together with a more constructive operating environment and strong balance sheet management we now expect to notably outperform our outlook relative to where we started the year with higher fee revenue growth and nii comfortably up year overyear as a result we expect to deliver both healthy positive fee and total operating leverage this year excluding notable items we are positioned for a strong finish to and we are confident as we look into next year operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions participants will be allowed one question and one followup question your first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much i appreciate all that detail i like the nii guide and what that i think implies for next year can you talk about the management actions taken you mentioned the five year the five quarter payback i want to be blunt and say does that mean youll make at least million of that cost over the next five quarters and then maybe a little more color on what within the book you actually restructured and offloaded thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp glenn its eric youve interpreted that exactly correctly the million loss that was booked in the quarter will reverse out in the next within the next five quarters and then well have some and itll be a positive for the company as we continue to manage the investment portfolio we have north of billion of assets they range from treasuries mbs securities to super nationals and foreign sovereigns there were some securities that we felt were lower coupon that could be restructured or repositioned through a sale we brought back some additional securities in this particular set of actions it was mostly in the treasury and international sovereign and super space it was billion or billion of securities on a billion book so relatively modest and it also allows us to just adjust the position of the book across the curve slightly which was also beneficial so kind of as i think youd expect but this will be helpful going forward and part of the management actions that weve been talking about as we manage nii some of those are around the investment portfolio some of those are around lending growth and some of those are around our engagement with clients on deposits as weve talked about in the past glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thats a nice parting gift thank you maybe one quick one you mentioned in the ssga conversation about the hybrid product with apollo im curious if you could give us any bits and detail of how it will work and why you chose maybe going to private credit is that enough to drive differentiated performance and salability is this just like a toe in the waters to see how this is going to be received state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah glenn its ron were in a quiet period now with the sec so were really constrained about what we can say about this but what i will say is weve been much of our innovation in the past has been about how do you democratize access to more sophisticated clients and put them in structures that are broadly available and what were talking about here is consistent with that well have a lot more to say about it after the sec has completed its process glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay cool thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs financial please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question and eric congrats on the new role big change in the multiples hope that doesnt create issues give you the bends or something when you go so curious about with erics departure kind of brings succession to mind so ron could you maybe update us on the latest on that front and what you can tell us about the boards plan ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp are you referring to my succession brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats right yeah overall ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp so as you would expect succession is something that wellmanaged and welloverseeing companies talk about all the time and theres a near constant discussion about this at the board and theres a plan in place for when that time comes brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then repo has been pretty solid clearly you guys see some continued strength hence the updated nii outlook for the year but could you tell us about how repo comes into play there into your expectations and what we should think about the recent strength there eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 glenn sic brennan its eric the repo product is one of many that we offer for clients right we offer them cash on deposit in various forms money market money market sweep repo is a collateralized activity so in a way think of it as one of the broad range of elements that we offer what we found is as the fed has trended down its reverse repo operation theres been more repo activity in the market and weve obviously wanted to be there to help our clients that said the repo activity the sponsored repo activity that we do is of our nii typically itll bounce around by a percentage point or two this quarter i called it out because i think we added about percentage point of nii due to the increase in repo activity and what youre working through is sometimes balances are up a bit sometimes margins are up a bit and weve just found more activity in the market theres more cash out there as youve seen and therere also more borrowers who are looking for cash and have collateral to post and those are markets where were happy to serve our clients on both sides of that transaction and stepped in and stepped up for them brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good afternoon everyone thanks eric congrats to you as well i guess in that vein and a question for both of you guys state street has made some pretty meaningful progress improving profitability recently but with a new cfo search underway how durable do you think these profitability improvements are likely to be so like in other words how much of this is already in motion and sort of on the rails that can more seamlessly perhaps transition to whoever comes next and what are your ultimate aspirations for pretax margins for the firm as a whole over time ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah alex ill start on that i mean weve been fairly transparent about what weve been doing across the board at the firm of both revenues and expenses so starting with our investment services business i mean weve talked a lot about what weve done to restore and regain and really distinguish ourselves in service quality which in turn has enabled us to actually grow and restore the growth that weve had in the past we talked a lot about some of the new sales and client service kinds of actions we have in place thats all in motion is there more to do for sure but is the plan clear yes it is but we would expect to see continued benefits being derived from that in ga weve got a broadbased strategy and theyre really aimed at how do we actually broaden the appeal and broaden the franchise beyond its traditional institutional core weve talked a lot about what weve done in the retail area with the lowpriced etfs product innovation is occurring at a really breakneck clip there we launched new etfs this year weve talked about some of the new partnerships that weve had which assuming we get through all the regulatory hurdles there were very optimistic about and so we feel like weve got that side covered in a pretty clear path state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 in the markets business the markets client franchise largely overlaps with our investment services franchise but thats not enough right you have to be able to distinguish yourself from there and i think the progress that youre seeing over the past couple of quarters reflects some of the work that weve done there with more to come i mean this is a franchise thats based on innovation and then finally in terms of productivity weve been talking to you about productivity and transformation since and every year we go at it in a different way typically a more sophisticated way each year the early years are about what i guess wed all describe as lowhanging fruit these later years have been about fundamental operating model transformation including a much more sophisticated application of technology thats where a lot of our investment is going but we see much more to do there so i wouldnt anticipate a new cfo signaling any kind of change in strategy now its not to say that it is a vitally important role and were going to the search process is literally commencing today weve already engaged a firm to help us well look both inside and outside but were very confident coupled with the plan we have in place with four months of transition that we have with eric and just the overall performance of the firm that were going to be in good shape through this transition eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp alex id also add our medium term targets stand as stated they are deeply embedded in our culture in our senior executive and management teams and with our board and so the to revenue growth rate pretax margin target of those are there for the medium term purposely and topics and areas that we continue to strive for and deliver on ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah and alex also im glad eric mentioned that also its part of our long term incentives its the achievement realization of those targets alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah all makes sense just wanted to clarify that so for my follow up maybe quickly on nii obviously very nice update for the fourth quarter probably too early to talk about with a lot of specificity but if you sort of think about how the balance sheet is positioned especially on the back of the recent securities repositioning youve talked about earlier today how should we think about the sustainability and just durability of this kind of nii run rate over the next couple of quarters i think in the past you talked about being a little more asset sensitive in europe still maybe a little bit more neutral in the us but maybe help us with some broader framework of how to think about thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah alex its eric as you say its still early were operating through deposit levels interestbearing non interestbearing our portfolio composition quarter by quarter by quarter and so we dont have additional information to really share regarding next year other than what weve said before right weve said that we continue for this past quarter and into the fourth quarter expect some modest or a slight amount of deposit rotation thats a headwind state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 weve got the investment portfolio rolling through but some quarters you get a bigger smaller benefit just depending on the exact bonds and then youve got lending activity and then youve got repo as we talked about earlier on the call bouncing up and down weve said that its really in the next few quarters and ive used that language purposely that we expect to see the stabilization of nii and then some growth from that level but its hard to pin exactly which quarter but i think what you can do is if you open up the lens over a oneyear threeyear fiveyear period you can see where weve come from you can see the zone that were operating in and ill just find the zone not as one percentage point difference but the kind of a zone as youd expect it in a colloquial sense but were i think were in a nice zone generally its helpful for our margin and while the next few quarters well see some movement we also see some stability and some growth thereafter alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you all right well i think well get you for one more quarter after that so im sure that will be another topic yet again so thank you operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc eric ill miss you sorry to see you go good luck in the next role and i guess my final question for you is just around how we should be thinking about the trajectory here of nii in an environment where maybe we get slower pace of cuts is that better for state street eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you betsy for the question and for the thoughts yeah i think directionally our balance sheet is relatively neutral we have a slight asset sensitivity and so as rates come down that has a slight impact to nii on a quarterly basis but its not dramatic but given that directional position wed have slightly better nii if rates didnt fall as quickly i think our collective view here is rates will come down but weve seen the market overshoot on the rate reductions our economists think that the terminal rate is likely to be substantively higher than what its been in the past and so i think were reasonably well positioned and well absorb some of the central bank actions and as we do that well continue to build out our client lending activity repo activity or deposit engagement activity and so forth and those will all contribute to a stabilization of nii around this zone and then growth from there state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks so much and then ron one for you on i think recently i saw a headline about state street leaning into mexico and wanted to understand is this a new effort or this is an expansion of existing business and maybe just put it into context around your growth strategy and are there other countries that youre looking to lean into thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp betsy so we certainly have a presence in latin america its smaller than emea and apac for us but as you would expect we tend to and this is all in the servicing a little bit in the markets area but its all in the it really arrives out of services and as countries develop and as investment markets develop thats the opportunity for us and so we are building out at a i would say moderate pace our capabilities and activity in latin america and what you saw there really reflected that our core markets as you could imagine remain the us emea and apac but as youve seen from our growth over the past couple of years weve had lots of growth in emea and apac more recently weve gotten the growth rate in the us kind of back on what it had been traditionally but as these markets grow they start to need the same kind of capabilities that weve got in those developed markets and also in many cases you have socalled emerging or developing markets that are really skipping over some of the milestones that developed markets had done in their development so again its an opportunity to bring some advanced technology and those kinds of things but its a modest investment and we would expect over the shortterm modest growth but its important to get the foothold there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good afternoon and congrats eric also maybe just taking on a comment that you mentioned eric about putting more of your balance sheet to work to support clients can you just go into a little bit more detail in terms of which areas i seem to mean on the asset side and lending and then in conjunction with that maybe if you can talk about deposit pricing strategies with your asset servicing clients in terms of either deposit beta or also supporting your clients in terms of the revenue model eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brian sure let me cover those in onebyone on the asset side of the balance sheet weve got a billion balance sheet weve got about billion of riskrelated assets and as we think about capital deployment it continues to be in three areas that weve historically supported our clients in and we want to continue to expand so the first one is lending as you mentioned and we do everything from capital call financing to bdc lending really an ecosystem of lending that we do for our private markets clients or asset management clients and so forth and theres real growth there for us theres growth there for them state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 and what we find constructive is that with many of those clients if you support them with your balance sheet theyre that much more encouraged and likely to come to you for servicing activities for asset management activities and thats a very constructive and kind of virtuous circle of a relationship that we and they benefit towards so lending is a very important part of what we do secondly our trading activities in fx require a balance sheet if we do more than just one two three months forward and swaps if we do options to support our clients those require balance sheet and again were happy to do that for our clients especially for our substantial clients that we have large relationships with and well do that around the world so thats a good part and then thirdly its really around the securities financing business which has both an agency lending component where were lending out of the box but that requires some capital under the basel iii rules and then the prime services business right where were lending out to those who are borrowers in the capital markets and thats been an area of growth as well so those are the areas but the way we think about it is that we think of ourselves and we really act as relationship lenders right we lend not for itself but we lend because its to support our clients it comes at good returns but it comes as a way to deepen and broaden and expand the relationships that we have so thats what weve been doing we like to continue to do that and the more we lend and support them across those different areas that i described those three areas the more growth well see both in nii and in the fee line on the question of is that helpful brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah perfect actually i can tie in the back half of that question with the second one and thats just on the revenue on the fee revenue side of your new wins particularly the alpha products i know the alpha platform rather and i know the private market initiatives as well should we be thinking of those as fee rate accretive or are you also flexible on pricing some of those with deposits as well on compensating balances eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp id say its a little bit of both to be honest we have for example in the servicing fee area ph we post million of wins on a trailing 12month basis we continue to target million to million of fees but yeah its obviously lumpy and a mandate sometimes pulls forward from a quarter sometimes moves out a quarter well see exactly where we land but we are continuing to hone in on delivering substantial amounts of fee wins this year and have that target clearly in sight as we do that deposits are a part of the relationship but more and more clients think of it both ways they understand that theres a balance of trade they understand that if they are pushing too much on one lever then the other levers have to move in the opposite direction on the other hand there is real opportunity to work with clients to see how we can serve more and more of their needs and what weve found that as we have got that as we have those discussions we end up doing more work with our clients and more support of our clients in more areas and so they tend to build and feed on each other as opposed to being offsetting brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 thats great color appreciate your detailed answers as always eric thanks very much operator the next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global securities please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good afternoon hey eric just on deposit behavior after the rate cut how did mix and volume growth look in pricing any thoughts on the initial reaction to the rate cuts in the deposit side eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp jim its eric we really just saw more of what weve been seeing over the last few months i dont think we saw any discernible change deposits in the system are generally been trending up point or points a quarter thats across the banking system youve seen our results are a little more of that and we didnt really see a lot of changes we continue just to see a market environment where theres a fair amount of cash in the system part of that is positioning part of that is i think carefulness on our investors that our investors have given the political and economic uncertainty and so the cuts didnt have a discernible impact on deposit levels and in general we think were going to operate in and around this level for the time being jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats helpful and maybe just pivoting to servicing fees still a significant backlog yet to be installed business in asset servicing so can you discuss how youre how quickly you expect that new business to be onboarded and how youre thinking about the quarterly trajectory from here eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah the servicing backlog weve enjoyed continuing to build we obviously want to build it and deploy it right both are important to our business system and i think over time itll continue to trend up somewhat and then get to a steadystate level right now as we look forward we think about the installation of that backlog in two ways on an auca basis we think about the installation coming in the next few years with somewhere between half to three quarters of that coming through in the next year and in terms of the servicing fee backlog itself we roughly expect about half of that to come through over the course of the fourth quarter and all of next year if you want to kind of rough it out and just think about the pace of installation what that means is that were always installing revenues from our backlog onto the balance sheet right or into the pl i should say and then its in the same time our coverage and relationship force out there winning new business and there is business that then installs within three months six months nine months and months and so over the every year youll see a mix youll see business that comes from a backlog that had a longer installation time period and then youll have business that comes from within that fiscal year itself jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 okay i appreciate the help thanks operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi ron hi eric congratulations eric on the new position ron you mentioned about the new business wins in the quarter and i think you said billion in assets under custodyadministration can you share with us how much of that came from existing clients where you grab the bigger wallet share from those clients versus new customers and second were the wins primarily in the us or were they outside the united states europe or asia ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah thanks for the question gerard so for this quarter there was we had two alpha wins and the two alpha wins dominate that auca its just about billion out of the billion is alpha and thats divided between us and nonus with a very very significant global player in there that has a lot of us presence and whats interesting about both of them is both these wins is they were existing but in one case we had a very very modest service footprint with this institution we were charles river only with them and as a result of this alpha wins well have a true fronttoback relationship with them including importantly to move the asset servicing from a competitor to us and with the asset excuse me im sorry moving the custody from a competitor to us and with custody comes lots of opportunities to do things like deposits and foreign exchange and things like that so and i think for years now as weve talked about the strategy and why this has been why we think its important and why we think it gives us a competitive advantage one of the reasons is just that its the opportunity to deepen relationships and the other reason why its so important is the flip side of taking long to install is that the business tends to be quite sticky because this is really its much more analogous to enterprise outsourcing where the institution is actually making a choice of either in most cases moving from an insourced model to an outsourced model in some cases moving from one outsourcer to another but that doesnt happen quite as frequently and as a result because of the work that both parties are doing we insist upon a longer contract period and the client itself understands these are very sophisticated buyers understand that theyre making a generational decision here and so they want to get it right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for that color and then as a followup question obviously you guys are wellcapitalized youve been using your capital to support organic growth as eric pointed out with lending and youre paying obviously dividends and increasing them and buying back your stock alternatively obviously capital can be used for acquisitions can you give us an update on your appetite for acquisitions recognizing of course the brown brothers transaction did not work out the way you intended but can you share with us your thoughts there as well ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2024 well gerard we think about ma not as a strategy but as a way to implement our strategy either more rapidly or more efficiently so well always be paying attention to opportunities like that but we see a lot of promise in the organic plans that we have developed and are now seeing the fruits of so our last significant acquisition as you know was charles river that was done for important strategic reasons to enable the creation of the alpha fronttoback platform it was a dilutive acquisition we knew that at the time but we felt it was a very important longterm investment and its proven to be but its also costly and often times disappointing to shareholders so we take our stewardship of capital responsibility very seriously and we like what were able to do on an organic basis or building on what weve done so not to say well never do these things but its a high bar and its got to be about as i said at the beginning of this answer its got to be really about accelerating the strategy andor realizing the strategy more efficiently than we could organically gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator i will now turn the call back over to ron ohanley for closing remarks please go ahead ronald philip ohanley chairman chief
