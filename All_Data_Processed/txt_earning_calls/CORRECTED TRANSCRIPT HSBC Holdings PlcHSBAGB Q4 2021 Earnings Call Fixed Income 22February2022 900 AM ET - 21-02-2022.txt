management discussion section operator good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by welcome to todays hsbcs annual results fixed income call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode there will be some opening remarks followed by a questionandanswer session operator instructions i must advise that this conference is being recorded today i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today carlo pellerani group treasurer carlo pellerani group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you very much martin and good afternoon everyone this is carlo im joined today by two individuals that need no introduction richard oconnor global head of investor relations and greg hayes head of debt investor relations im not going to go through the slides that we posted nor going to give a very long speech ill limit myself to making a few highlights about the results and then ill go through into a bit more detail on the financial resources and then pretty quickly go into qa in terms of the highlights for the results return on tangible quite helped by the release of ecl provisions but we have very good earnings diversification with all the regions being profitable revenues grew by in the quarter and we have given the rate environment more confidence on a positive nii trend and you would have seen that we have announced that we are now flagging a return on tangible for onwards one year earlier than previously planned in terms of balance sheet dynamics we had billion of loan growth across hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 wealth and personal banking and commercial banking and as well we had billion of growth in deposits for the quarter our credit quality remains good we had low stage charges and you would have seen that our stage loans represent about of the total loans and they have been stable at that level we have now released about of the covid reserves that we had put during and we have million of those still remaining we are expecting our ecl charges to normalize somewhere around basis point during you would have seen that we took some charges on china cre and we have given you some slides in the document and some more information where you can see our exposures and details around those turning to financial resources taking each of them in turn first from a capital perspective our capital ratios continue to be quite strong cet1 ratio at the end of the year dividends of and we have announced a new billion buyback on top of the up to billion that we had announced in the last quarter as a reminder we have flagged that we are planning to be back within our target range of to cet1 ratio from this year onwards from a liquidity perspective liquidity continued to be super strong lcr of but that of course masks the surplus liquidity we have in all the subsidiaries which gets deducted from the hqla ratio so if you were to take into account that the total hqla that we have as a group is billion we continue to pursue initiatives to increase the returns and efficiency on the excess liquidity in addition to our desire to increase our customer lending book mrel ratio very very healthy at the end of the year please note that our requirements have actually gone down by basis points on the back of the uk leverage computations which affect both the leverage base requirement but also the sum of the parts given that a lot of the entities are leverage constrained from an mrel perspective from a funding perspective we have been until now in a building out phase of our mrel stack we have ended that phase and now were getting into a refinancing and rebalancing mode of the stack so we should be expecting pretty much zero net senior holdco issuance for the year we are flagging about billion from a gross perspective we are likely to be in the market for at1 this year we dont quite have much of a need of course we reserve the right to be in the market should we think thats appropriate we are conversely planning to return to the tier market we have been absent from that market for about five years and you would have seen that we are saying that we are planning to have around billion of issuance for the year and we have added some disclosures in terms of our legacy capital stack and some updates on our position on ibor thats all i wanted to say so in summary a very strong year return of targets have been brought forward by about a year improved rate environment which gives you a nice tailwind capital funding and liquidity positions are all very very strong net issuance substantially down on prior years and our mrel stack now at a steady state so with that very brief introduction ill open up for question martin back to you please hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of lee street from citigroup please go ahead lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd hello thanks for taking thanks for doing the call and thanks for taking my questions i have three for you firstly just on the slide the fixed income slides and weve had a fair few questions always about how the infection risk works that you highlight there now ph clearly it doesnt highlight theres anything new but could you just clarify exactly how it works secondly as you highlighted youre returning to the tier market i think you flagged about billion of issuance obviously youve got a significant volume of operating company tier still outstanding a lot of thats not going to work any longer i guess the question is why wouldnt you look to do some form of liability management and then finally on additional tier and you highlight limited needs just any thoughts around that because obviously it looks like youve got quite a few components coming up to call over the forthcoming year and why you need to be quite so limited that would be my three questions thank you carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks very much for the questions lee so on the first one on infection risk infection risk can be mitigated when we voluntarily derecognize the securities so you would have seen that that is kind of the plan that we have for each of the components of the stack so we dont think that that poses any issue at the moment that each of the securities lose kind of eligibility in terms of tier yes youre right we have a number of tier outstanding that have lost as well some value on some of those that will lose value in the future liability management is always one of the potential options that well have we will look at each of those in turn we will continue to look at all options available in terms of at1 yes i mean you should for now assume and thats what we have in the plan that we would let those transactions to come and we wouldnt be replacing them so we have no plan at the moment to replacing those at1s for this year again depending on market conditions we may want to get ahead of ph next year or few years lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd so just to clarify so you have no plans to replace them or you will only look to replace them so im not sure i understood carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yeah so we have no plan for issuing any at1 this year lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd okay and can i read anything into ph retention with regards of the calls that are coming up hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc no you shouldnt lee street q strategist citigroup global markets ltd all right ill leave it there thank you for your time operator thank you your next question today comes from the line of daniel david of autonomous please go ahead daniel david q analyst bernstein autonomous llp hi thanks for the call and taking my questions i also want to focus on the legacy risk i think theres quite a lot of interest there just focusing on the legacy tier and noting your comments and i can see that theyre not mrel capital can you just help me with the rationale for leaving these bonds outstanding given the cet1 headroom youve got and what theyre costing you and are these bonds swapped so could the interest rate be hedged when you come to potentially do a may call the second question i have just goes back to your point on derecognition from an fx risk point of view i had understood the eba guidance is quite clear that you cant do this unless you call change terms or lme to mitigate the infection risk so my question is is the uks approach different to the ebas as the pra i guess rolled over and let you take this treatment im just a bit surprised to read this and then finally just on the resolvability assessment framework could you just help us understand the timelines have you submitted all your information and when do you expect the results and do you expect to be told on the pra stance before the public disclosure in june thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thanks thanks daniel on the legacy securities so when were assessing the legacy securities that are outstanding we always look at if you want three different components and the blended result of those three components drives whether we will be taking any action on those securities those components are first of all the regulatory requirement we are in ongoing discussions with the regulators around those maybe well get more information around midyear about those but its fair to say that the regulatory treatment of the legacy securities is not black and white i mean there are shades of gray there in all sorts of securities i would note that some securities are particularly challenging and that includes ph near loss securities where as you know even if we wanted it would be impossible to pretty much eliminate a full stack so the point im trying to make is this is not a black and white obviously from a regulatory perspective it would be better for those securities not to be there but given the complications and all the different components i think the regulatory treatment tends to be a little bit grayer than that the second component is of course yours and investors interest we are a longterm issuer in the market and we want to have a longterm constructive relationship with investors and as such we will take those interests in mind but finally and very very importantly we look at the economics of those securities and the economics of hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 those securities as an outsider outside in from the firm is not totally straightforward for you to see how those economics play out because you need to look at the accounting treatment that we have for those securities internally we need to look indeed as to whether we have those securities hedged or unhedged from an interest rate perspective we need to look at what is the optionality value of those securities for future funding like for example we have at the moment in the case of discos so there is all sorts of economic components that affect whether those securities are or not in our interest to be called clearly ill leave it at that but that basically drives whether we would or not call some of the securities in terms of hedging were not going to comment on individual hedging on individual securities but likewise we shouldnt assume that we have hedged them all in terms of the recognition i think you pretty much you answered it in your question it is the uk rather than the eba approach from a uk perspective we can deal with that by voluntarily derecognizing the securities that is acceptable way of dealing with infection risk in the uk and in terms of the rough timeline we submitted our self assessment last year we have been in contact with the bank of england and indiscernible they have sent a number of questions on the back of those we actually sent an update to that a couple of weeks ago in line with everyone else in the market and the next step of the process is midyear just in june there is going to be a public disclosure made by both the bank of england and ourselves on the status of that assessment i guess well have to wait for that one obviously we will have discussions with them ahead of that in terms of what is it that were going to be disclosing and well be aligning communication daniel david q analyst bernstein autonomous llp thanks indiscernible just to double check also on the voluntary derecognition point on the slide you say subject to regulatory approval so has this been approved or is it waiting to be approved carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc that is part of the discussion on the selfassessment and on the rough and youll see i guess the effect of that at middle of the year daniel david q analyst bernstein autonomous llp okay all right thanks operator thank you your next question today comes from the line of robert smalley of ubs please go ahead robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for doing the call just following up on one point then another subject you mentioned the discos if you were to leave those outstanding how would they be categorized within the liability stack and then two other questions one you made a large provision for real estate in china could you talk about the hong kong real hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 estate market and if theres going to be any need for provisions there given the economic slowdown and the moves weve seen of personnel out of hong kong and then third on uk mortgages swap rates moving much faster than you could probably reprice mortgages so could you talk about the impact on your margin for the next couple of quarters on that thanks carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks thanks robert so in terms of the ph disco state de facto becomes senior debt and that senior debt is actually not that expensive so the discos are libor plus to libor plus perpetual funding so we look at them in the context of funding value most of the discos are issue out of a nonringfenced bank which is an entity that is naturally in funding need long term so having that optionality is actually quite valuable so thats how we look at the discos and robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc okay carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc in terms sorry robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc no go ahead sorry carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc in terms of china cre yes i think the segment of the china cre that is most impacted is the offshore segment we have exposures to that segment in hong kong we have about billion of exposure there about half of that book is in what we call enhanced monitoring mode the other half is investment grade and better and so there is always of course a chance that you will get more impact at this stage we have reserved what we think is appropriate for where we are just note that we have announced or we have mentioned that were expecting that we will be returning to around a normalized basis points of provisions for the year that basis point include as well any foreseeable impact that we can at this stage see on the cre market having said that of course the situation is fluid and we will continue to look at it i mean if you were to look at developments this year there seems to be a little bit more support for the china cre market coming in terms of commentary and some of the dynamics in the market but again trying to predict that ahead is treacherous so i think we will have to see how that develops richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc just to add one thing clearly the public companies youve read about having liquidity and other issues are mainland china public companies ph much of which was because of exposure to offshore the question was very much more i think about hong kong incorporated public companies who have been who we have very strong relationship with for decades tend to be very well resourced very very conservative ltvs the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 hong kong property market has been very very resilient and indeed still very very good prices clearing in both the commercial and residential property market in hong kong so clearly we keep an eye on all our portfolios but the issue is really that mainland china offshore market at the moment carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc and in terms of uk mortgage pricing yes your observation is right the swap i mean a lot of the mortgages in the uk of course are fixed and the dynamics of the swap markets are slightly different to the dynamics on the short end so yes it is quite possible that that market will continue to have a little bit of competitive pressure it is a very very competitively priced market we continue to originate new mortgages on returns that are higher than our cost of capital so at the moment we are comfortable with those mortgages even at the compressed spreads but of course is something that we will keep an eye on i dont know richard if you want to slide in richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah the other thing is clearly the market tends to look at mortgage prices in the newspapers today versus swap rates today but clearly theres a lag between swap rates either moving up or down and ph companies are themselves moving mortgage pricing we dont move it every day clearly we move it on a regular basis but theres always a lag between mortgage pricing going up and down versus swap rates so clearly just as a reminder swap rates have moved and inflation moved dramatically in the last six weeks but just bear in mind theres normally a lag there before mortgage pricing starts to reflect that robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thanks thats very helpful appreciate it operator thank you operator instructions your next question today comes from the line of alvaro ruiz of morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc thank you very much for taking my questions and apologies because i have three questions a lot of them about legacy and the first one is about hsbc and if i follow with what you just said that there are three angles to lme or to exercise the makewhole call of the security you are looking at regulatory requirements investor interest and accounting treatment i think its quite clear that the security is useless from a capital perspective issued from ph an spb and with all the details that you already said in the pillar then if you can provide some color on the security that will be great the second one is about tier more broadly you said that you are going to issue tier for first time this year ph and another two lmes the opco tier securities do you need to issue it first in other words an approval to lme the securities is subject to replace all other tier securities assuming from obviously from the holding company and my third question is about the discos i think we discussed this point in the past but one of the discos is issued from the hong kong subsidiary can you please confirm that you look at this security in a different way to the other three thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you alvaro despite the questions are all on legacy your first question i think is on the nonringfenced bank trust preferred security yes you have identified correctly i think one of the three conditions the regulatory treatment i mean we havent called the securities so it must mean that the other conditions kind of affect why we havent made a decision a little alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc im sorry which condition investor interest i mean or accounting treatment carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc well it must be also the economics alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc its not economical to exercise the makewhole call of these securities is what youre saying carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc that could be one of the conclusions overall we havent made a decision to call them because on balance that doesnt work for us at this stage we will continue to look at it alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc okay carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc so in terms of the tier no i think we dont have a specific requirement on the tier stack right we have a capacity to have tier in our stack up to a certain amount that at the moment we have underweight right so its not a precondition for one is not a precondition to the other so we will continue to look at all the options for q2 i mean that could include smes it could include exchanges it would be issuances we will look at all of the above in terms of discos yes i think the only similarity between the hong kong securities and the ones who are nonringfenced is the type of instruments the two are very different because the legal entities have very different needs you could say that our hong kong entity is less of a natural funding need entity than it is the ph nonretail bank and also from a regulatory perspective the hong kong discos are no longer counting from a regulatory perspective so we dont treat them the same we would make those decisions individually in each of the entities alvaro ruiz de alda q analyst morgan stanley co international plc okay thank you very much and apologies again because these legacy questions are always horrible hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you alvaro operator thank you we do have one more question at this time this comes from the line of tom jenkins of jefferies please go ahead tom jenkins q analyst jefferies hello sorry and thanks very much dont keep you very much longer and guess what its on legacies which you should be very proud of because it means no ones concerned about anything fundamental or anything else so its actually quite a good thing that we focus on these sort of the trends indiscernible of these securities but ive got one question which i dont know if i missed earlier i only heard lee on the first one which is normally the first question so i dont think i missed anything but libor i know you put a slide in there after the i think slide on the slide deck how are you thinking in terms of your fallback language on the discos because its really not clear it talks about sort of lowest deposit rate sort of as a base of the fallback of libor sofr is not based on deposits so i was just wondering what youre thinking in terms of whether you fix whether youve got an alternative is there an alternative that i didnt know about im sure there is i mean just talk to me a little bit about your fallback language on the discos if you may thank you carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc hi tom thanks for the question yes so sterling ph near low instruments for those the us legislative solution doesnt quite work of course the conundrum with those securities like for all the ph near loss securities is that we will not be able to successfully consent for of the securities given the dynamics of the new law so we are looking at the options with those securities i mean just tom jenkins q analyst jefferies sorry im sorry i dont want to waste your time were talking at cross purposes i was thinking of the discos which are under english law and what the transference would be into libor carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc oh yes apologies tom jenkins q analyst jefferies indiscernible no no no please dont apologize i obviously wasnt clear carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 yes in terms of those securities we are looking to offer similar consent solicitation as we did with the other securities well come with those in due course i mean those securities we have time until for them tom jenkins q analyst jefferies sure but do you think based on the language in the documentation that you can use software and then maybe upscale the coupons as compensation as you did with the sterling liable bonds or would you use a different base rate i mean clearly it cant square the circle in terms of what the language in the bond says about the lowest deposit rate and what youre talking about in terms of offering a new what the lowest deposit rate sort of replacement would be if its not a sofr because it is not ph corporate rate carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yeah some tom jenkins q analyst jefferies its the treasury rate carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yeah the fallbacks on those securities are questionable at this stage tom jenkins q analyst jefferies okay carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yeah so its not tom jenkins q analyst jefferies would you consider fixing or would you consider just actually getting rid of the damned things and stopping these irritating questions from people like me carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc it is tempting it is definitely tempting we will listen and we will leave our options open at this stage i mean overall we are committed in seeking to remediate or mitigate anything around ph ibor rates and we are going to work together with investors to find a solution that works for everyone and this is a complex space highlighted by the goal tom jenkins q analyst jefferies hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 22feb2022 you should go into politics honestly right okay so basically theres no firm answer theres no guidance its just like lets hope for the best and not for the worst is that the kind of thing indiscernible carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc yes yes i think its more than that right in terms of the english law securities included in the discos we expect to offer a similar constant solicitation as the one we did for us libor securities i think thats the best i can say at this stage tom jenkins q analyst jefferies right okay all right well as and when you know what the possible base might be and do please let the market know wed be im sure very appreciative carlo pellerani a group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc thank you tom jenkins q analyst jefferies thanks very much operator thank you there are no further questions at this time mr pellerani back to you carlo pellerani group treasurer group general manager hsbc holdings plc okay so thank you very much for the call and for the interest in legacy securities in particular i hope that the call was helpful for you if you have any more questions please pick it up with greg and ir team and we will endeavor to answer especially if theyre not around legacy securities so thank you very much operator that does conclude our conference for today thank you all for participating hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income
