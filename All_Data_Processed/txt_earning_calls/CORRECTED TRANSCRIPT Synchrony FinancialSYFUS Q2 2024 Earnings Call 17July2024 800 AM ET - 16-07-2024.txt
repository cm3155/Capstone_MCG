everyone today synchrony reported strong second quarter results including net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of this performance is a testament to our differentiated business model we continue to leverage our diversified portfolio of products and sales platforms disciplined approach to credit underwriting and management and innovative digital capabilities to further progress on our strategic objectives and to deliver sustainable riskadjusted growth and returns over the long term customer demand for synchronys product and value propositions remained strong during the second quarter as synchrony added million new accounts grew average active accounts by generated billion of synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 purchase volume and delivered ending receivables growth of compared to last year synchronys proprietary data and analytics in combination with our flexible financing solutions and dynamic technology platform have been core drivers of our performance through evolving market conditions particularly as we seek to responsibly address the needs of our customers and partners and while our credit trends relative to prepandemic levels have outperformed most of the industry today we have leveraged these strengths to take action in our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of default these credit actions along with a more selectively spending consumer have contributed to lower new account and purchase volume growth in the second quarter but have also improved our recent delinquency trends and should strengthen our portfolios credit trajectory in and beyond at the platform level purchase volume and receivables trends were generally consistent in the second quarter purchase volume growth ranged from up to down yearoveryear broadly reflecting lower consumer spend on bigger ticket items particularly in categories like furniture jewelry and vision as well as the impact of the credit actions meanwhile receivables growth across the platforms ranged from to higher versus last year driven primarily by payment rate moderation dual and cobranded cards accounted for of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased synchronys outofpartner spend gives us deeper insight into recent customer trends as the broad utility of our offerings and compelling value propositions attract purchases across a range of categories industries and products our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases particularly in larger ticket categories such as home furnishings travel and entertainment they have been spending more at restaurants though and continue to spend at the pharmacy and on health and wellness needs and contributing to nondiscretionary spend growth more broadly that said our customers are spending slightly less per transaction across most categories and credit grades as average transaction values declined about versus last year only our top credit segment saw growth in average ticket values during the second quarter customers across credit grades are transacting more frequently however which has generally offset most of the impact of lower transaction values altogether we view these spend behaviors as appropriate and consistent with the payment rate normalization that began in our portfolio in and has continued since over the first six months of however the pace of this payment rate moderation has decelerated across credit grades and according to the external deposit data we monitor there continues to be relative stability in savings balances compared to the rapid tapering that occurred through the middle of last year when taken together we believe these spend payment and savings trends support our view that consumers are making healthy decisions to actively manage their cash flows and these trends coupled with the impact of our credit actions give us confidence that synchronys net chargeoff rate should be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half as we continue to monitor the health of the consumer our portfolio credit performance and that of the broader industry synchrony is also utilizing our proprietary insights and lending expertise to position our business for a sustainable riskadjusted growth for many years to come during the second quarter we added or renewed more than partners including a program expansion and extension with verizon and the addition of virgin red we are excited about our

with that ill turn the call over to brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys second quarter results continue to demonstrate the resilience of our differentiated business model through an evolving environment while consumers are managing their cash flows and consumption and the impact to our credit actions are beginning this season we remained focused on driving sustainable riskadjusted growth turning to our financial performance ending loan receivables grew to billion in the second quarter benefiting from our approximately 80basispoint decrease in the payment rate and reflecting growth across each of our sales platforms net revenue increased to billion reflecting higher interest and fees lower rsa and an increase in other income net interest income increased to billion as interest and fees grew primarily reflecting growth in average loan receivables synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 our loan receivable yield grew basis points benefiting from product repricing actions and lower payment rate partially offset by the higher reversals as our net chargeoffs increased rsas of million in the second quarter were of average loan receivables down million versus the prior year driven by higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher net interest income and the increase in other income primarily reflected a million gain related to the exchange of our visa b1 shares as well as initial feerelated impact of our product pricing and policy changes or pppcs these benefits were partially offset by the impact of the pets best disposition provision for credit losses increased to billion reflecting higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve build other expenses grew to billion which was driven by technology investments preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change and servicing costs related to newly acquired businesses partially offset by the operational losses and cost discipline resulting in lower employee and marketing costs the preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule changes reflected million of incremental costs related to both the execution of our pppcs and the implementation of the rule itself should it become effective even with these incremental costs synchronys efficiency ratio was for the second quarter an improvement of approximately basis points versus last year in sum synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share this produced a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of next ill cover our key credit trends on slide at quarter end our 30plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year and basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of to our 90plus delinquency rate was versus last year and basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of to and our net chargeoff rate was in the second quarter compared to in the prior year and basis points above our historical average from the second quarters of to our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was up basis points from in the first quarter the reserve build in the quarter primarily reflected loan receivable growth as shown on slide the credit actions weve taken thus far are improving our delinquency trajectory as the rate of yearoveryear growth continues to decelerate well continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance and the credit trends for the broader industry given our shared consumer and we will take additional credit actions as necessary while these actions are reducing new account and purchase volume growth in the short term we expect they will strengthen our portfolios positioning as we exit and support our ability to deliver our targeted riskadjusted returns over the long term turning to slide synchronys funding capital and liquidity remain a source of strength we grew our direct deposits in the quarter as consumers responded to our strong offerings while reducing our brokered deposits deposits represented of our total funding at quarter end and secured and unsecured debt each represented of total funding total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were billion up billion from last year and represented of total assets up basis points from last year moving on to our capital ratios as a reminder we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies synchrony will make a final transitional adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately basis points in january the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 under the cecl transition rules we ended the second quarter with a cet1 ratio of basis points lower than last years our tier capital ratio was basis points above last year our total capital ratio increased basis points to and our tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year during the second quarter we returned million to shareholders consisting of million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends as of quarter end we had billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization for the period ending june synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan combining those results synchrony delivered a second quarter performance largely within our expectations we remain focused on taking appropriate actions to prepare our business for years to come including our ability to deliver our longterm target loss rates between and and average return on assets of at least on average over time weve been closely monitoring our performance and taking prudent credit actions in support of these objectives and in preparation for the pending new rule on late fees and our desire to offset the impact on our business as soon as possible synchrony has completed the first phase of our pppcs most of these actions will begin to go into effect in the second half of and well continue to track their financial and operational impact on our customers partners and portfolio to determine alongside our partners whether any refinements to our strategies are warranted to achieve our shared objective as a reminder specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rules and our pppcs there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of late feerelated litigation that was filed in march the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule changes and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the pppcs we implement as a result of the new rule outcomes and actual performance related to these uncertainties could impact our outlook with that framework lets turn to the outlook for the second half of we expect the consumer to continue to manage their cash flows and consumption which when combined with our credit actions should result in flat to lowsingle digit decline in purchase volume we continue to expect payment rates to moderate which when combined with our purchase volume expectations should contribute to more moderate loan receivable growth in the second half excluding the impact of late fee rule implementation we expect net interest income and other income to progressively grow in the third and fourth quarters as our pppcs take effect from a credit perspective delinquency should continue to trend in line with or better than seasonality we expect our net chargeoff rate to be lower in the second half of this year than the first half our reserve coverage ratio at the end of is expected to be generally in line with our yearend reserve rate rsa will continue to align with program and company performance and finally we expect other expenses to trend in line with the first half average on a dollar basis when you combine these factors and include the impact of late fee rule assuming an implementation date of october along with the various offsets from the implementation of our pppcs and the per share gain on the sale of our pets best business in synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per share between and for the full year this consolidated and updated eps range is in the upper end of our prior guidance and reflects synchronys dedication to delivering optimized outcomes for our many stakeholders including strong riskadjusted return for our shareholders synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 i will now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian synchrony continues to execute at a high level in an evolving environment we are leveraging our scale our data analytics and credit management tools our advanced digital capabilities and our deep lending expertise to remain nimble and responsive while powering still better experiences and greater value to the customers partners providers and small businesses we serve we are consistently driving compelling results for our many stakeholders and that momentum is increasingly attracting new and deepening existing opportunities for continued riskadjusted growth further embedding synchrony at the heart of american commerce and with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions again please limit yourself to one question and one followup question well take our first question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning thank you for taking my question i wanted to start with just the health of the consumer it sounds like the consumer is coming in a little weaker than you had maybe anticipated between purchase volume being lower reserve rate a little higher first i guess is that a fair statement and if so can you just comment on what other changes that is driving is it signaling that you need to tighten underwriting are you continuing to tighten underwriting is that broadbased is it about tweaking around the edges just how are you thinking of the consumer heading into like backtoschool season here and just trying to understand your view on the consumer brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah yeah no thanks for the question i think well generally i think in the aggregate the consumer is still in pretty good shape i think the trends that were seeing are pretty similar across the industry obviously labor market is strong thats definitely helping i think most of the indicators so far are largely in line with what were expecting to see with that said as you kind of dig into the portfolio there are clearly some differences as well as you look at different customer cohorts the more affluent higherincome segments are still spending theyre not synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 really as impacted by inflation on the other end of the spectrum you are starting to see the lowerincome consumer pull back a bit theyre rotating into nondiscretionary categories so its clear that theyre feeling the effects of inflation and theyre managing to a budget and so while youre seeing that impact purchase volume indiscernible new accounts we think thats actually a positive from a credit perspective people are being disciplined thats a good thing we dont see people overextending so theyre managing their spend and their cash flows which again i think is a positive from a credit perspective mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc so maybe just staying on credit then just on the reserve rate guidance its changed to be i think now youre saying yearend in line with i think earlier it was a little bit better than that said you did call out and we see the data right the delinquency rate is trending in line or better than seasonality were you expecting more improvements than youve got im just trying to understand the factors driving the higher guide on reserve rate and if that implies net chargeoffs will be similar to brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question mihir when we entered the year i think everyone had a perspective with regard to how the economy is going to develop how inflation potentially could bend and interest rates could move down right as brian mentioned the consumer is managing and the longer they stay in a period of higher costs particularly those that are lower income to medium income that poses different risks i think as we sit here in the middle part of the year we would have hoped for probably greater progression against the inflation even though we understood it was sticky and wed hoped for even though we only had three rate increases or rate im sorry rate decreases for the back half of the year were down to one so i think things have shifted out a little bit so i think were just being a little bit more cautious with regard to how we think about the macro going forward until we see signs that inflation really is breaking through some of the stickiness and you see some help to those consumers so i dont think its a tremendously different posture its just a little bit more conservative in how you think about your quantitative reserves versus your qualitative reserves mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you for taking my question brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mihir operator thank you our next question comes from terry ma with barclays please go ahead terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 hi thanks good morning so i guess based on the rollout of your pppcs is the million to million range still kind of the right range to think about for the second half and then secondly is there a way you can kind of quantify how that range changes if the late fee cap were to not be implemented this year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question terry ill start where you ended as we sit here today there continues to be activity in the texas courts and as brian indicated and i indicated in our remarks that is uncertain so the best guess we have now is an october implementation date and until we get some more definitive view with regard to whether or not that rule becomes effective on that date or a different date we dont really have an update with regard to the impact and its effect if it doesnt go into play so again when we have greater certainty with regard to that implementation date well most certainly come back with regard to the impact of the pppcs we provided updated guidance today again if you take the midpoint of both the core as well as the late fee assuming october implementation date and add the pets best youre at the midpoint to high end of the range from an eps which should give you a perspective on how we feel about both the core business as well as the actions were taking with regard to the potential change in late fees terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc got it okay thats helpful and then in terms of the rsa how should we think about how that would trend in the second half as your kind of indiscernible again start rolling in brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah a framework to think about terry is to think about the pieces that are going to flow through here obviously we indicated that the second half loss rate will be lower than the first half loss rate so obviously thats a upward bias on the rsa percent most certainly i think in the third quarter youre going to see some of the pppc actions roll through thats going to create an upward bias in the rsa and then that turns around in the fourth quarter again assuming an october implementation date of late fees that comes into place and then i think its just going to track with nii growth which will be a little bit beneficial with slightly lower purchase volume so therell be some puts and takes some of which will create headwinds some of which will create tailwinds terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc yeah got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks terry operator thank you our next question will come from mark devries with deutsche bank please go ahead mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 yeah thanks look i appreciate theres a lot of moving pieces on the nim for the second half of the year just given the implementation of some of the ppcs sic pppcs and the potential rolling of the late fee impact but could you just brian maybe just give us a sense of kind of what the moving pieces are and what kind of your expectations are for nim in the back half of the year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure thanks for the question mark so heres a framework how i think about some of the moving pieces you got to take into consideration right number one as we talked about net chargeoffs being lower in the second half versus the first half youll get a benefit to the net interest margin right relative to lower reversals so thats a positive to net interest margin i think when you look at the net funding costs so the interest expense and the investment income thats probably going to be flattish to the back half of the year you will pick up and therell be a benefit into the net interest margin relative to the mix between average loan receivables and average interest earning assets so that will be a positive to nim you will pick up and you should see it in the third quarter some of the pppc actions that are yield related so again some of the things that were strictly apr related some of the practices related how interest was assessed and a little bit related to some promotional fees that roll into place and you should see again hopefully a little bit benefit on the interest and fee line so generally there should be a positive trend up from where we move here into the back half of the year mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and are there any contemplated pppc measures that youve yet to put in place and are waiting for either to see how the consumer behaves or for actual implementation of the changes to the late fee rules brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah what our team has gone through the first wave that weve executed against that are ones that we have fully vetted internally with ourselves and with our partners so theyre fully executed there are other things down the road that are probably a little bit longer tail that were still continuing to evaluate some around product configuration and other types of products for different segments inside the portfolio so thats not necessarily ph part of initial sub but that may be a reaction that we come back with over time but wasnt necessarily critical to us to try to achieve the goal of being roa neutral with the same level of sales mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mark have a good day brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 thanks mark mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with td cowen please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks just continuing on that idea of the pricing changes i know its early but have there been kind of impacts on the consumer side that you can kind of see or talk about positive or negative from the pricing changes that youve put in place brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thank you moshe for the question we have a detailed monitoring dashboard thats in place that looks at a lot of different measures moshe it starts with purchase active rate sales per account as you can imagine it includes closure rates voluntary closure rates it includes call volume complaint volume all sorts of different measures that we would look at relative to this i think its important to understand while the first wave is complete now from we only have the cits that we mailed in december having a full quarter when we look at that dashboard in its entirety its generally in line with our expectations as we step into the third quarter i think were going to get a greater view with regard to consumers adoption with regard to it and i think weve seen some positive things around ebill adoption et cetera so we closely monitor it gets produced and distributed to a wide variety of people inside the organization as we closely look at that and share that with our partners moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen got it thanks and brian you talked a little bit about the delinquency and loss rates relative to the to averages given that youve kind of said and reaffirmed that they will continue to improve and be lower in the second half and possibly better than seasonals i guess how do you see that assuming employment levels are stable here how would you see that kind of trending towards those averages how close could they get and what is it that would then kind of get you to the point where you could think about neutralizing or reversing some of those tightening efforts brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so i think its important moshe to really take a step back first of all weve lagged the industry with regard to normalization i think when you look at the amount that we are above our to range i think outside of maybe one or twoish whereas we actually are performing pretty well being our 30plus is basis points higher than the historical average and our 90plus being basis points higher than historical average and then again youre right when you look at the second quarter on a 30plus basis were a couple of basis points favorable to seasonality and 90plus i think we were from a range of to basis points less than so synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 generally in line to slightly better than seasonality so i think we look at that i think we even look at how the macro environment develops and again the consumers managing today as we start to see relief kind of come to them i think well reevaluate i would not have an expectation that were going to adjust those refinements in the near term here until we get greater clarity on the environment moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen okay thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe have a good day operator thank you our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial hey ryan brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe stick with the late fee topic given the range of things that have been added aprs paper statements trailing interest and the like obviously markets have become hopeful that the rule could get delayed or may rule in favor of the industry and im just curious in a scenario in a positive outcome for the industry when you think about the range of changes youve made what changes do you foresee sticking versus others that theres a potential you may pare back over time brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah first of all good morning ryan the first thing i think we have to have certainty right relative to whether or not the late fee rule if it is delayed or ultimately overturned by the courts whether or not the cfpb would continue down the path of pursuing some type of limitation on late fee so i think you have to have some level of certainty beyond that i think as you think about the pricing changes first and foremost were going to look at consumer behavior and whether or not consumer behavior changes here and whether or not changes will be warranted i think when you step beyond that theres probably two buckets ryan the first bucket is one that involves our partners and rsas and there we would go and share the data with our partners and have a discussion with regard to pricing and synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 make some decisions with their input and then bucket b is things that are inside our brand and control so you think about our synchrony mastercard our home auto card things like that that we would control but obviously we do that its fair to say not everything would ever get rolled back but to be honest with you ryan we have not spend a lot of time as a team going through this scenario right now were really focused on implementing the pppcs and following the developments in the court and being prepared i think for the outcome that the late fee rule goes into effect ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then if you look at how new accounts have progressed obviously theyre down a decent amount year overyear which makes sense given the discussion regarding tighter underwriting but as you look ahead given the tightness that it doesnt sound like its going to be rolled back right now you also have some payment rate normalization how do you think about the pace of loan growth over intermediate timeframe brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so first let me just focus for a little bit on new accounts the theres probably two big buckets there ryan the first is we are seeing and brian talked about this with discretionary spend and some of the things where the consumers managing their spend levels we are seeing lower foot traffic and lower retail traffic both in a physical footprint as well as in a digital orientation so the throughthedoor population most certainly is limiting some of the opportunities to generate new accounts and then obviously youve had a modest impact from credit actions with regard to doing that that will impact growth more so in than it does really in right so you think about an account build it probably takes about months or so to kind of get to a average balance per account thats more mature so i think youre at a little bit of pressure here i do think given our position with most of our partners you would see probably something above gdp level and well continue to grow more certainly when you look at the platforms were excited about the health wellness growth we continue to experience even though theres some pullback there in cosmetic and lasik for example but that is a strength for us we continue to have strength in some of the other platforms like our home specialty business and home auto so again were not going to necessarily give guidance but i think theres some positive things inside of the sales platforms that will hopefully bridge us into a better economic period brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i think the other thing i would add ryan the active account growth that were seeing we actually probably watch that even more than new account growth because weve been making big investments in lifecycle marketing and figuring out across all of our platforms how do you engage that customer in the second and third fourth purchase and so just seeing that positive inflection yearoveryear i think is a positive and then look the consumer is still in a good spot but we are seeing lower store traffic and some pullback there and then were obviously proactively making some credit actions thatll improve the trajectory into next year so overall we feel pretty good about the trends that were seeing ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc awesome appreciate the color synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan operator thank you our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning maybe just a followup on some of the questions around credit quality brian wenzel if we i know ive heard you talk about some of the moves you made to sort of refine the underwriting some time ago i mean are the benefits of that in front of us so that we should see some more steppedup improvement in that second derivative on delinquency rates and then just im trying to think through some of the questions that were asked before like shouldnt that really that coupled with the tighter underwriting and the slower loan growth should help credit quality shouldnt it so i mean is that just builtin conservatism in your credit outlook or what for this year in terms of the flat reserve rate thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah first of all good morning sanjay and thanks for the question i think theres a combination where the credit actions remember we started this in the second quarter last year into third and then really started in again the latter part of the first quarter into the second quarter of this year you see reflecting in the moderation of the yearoveryear change in delinquencies which we showed on page of the earnings presentation here so some of it is being manifested itself in delinquency trends obviously it takes time to season so i think you would expect the benefit of those actions to kind of continue to go through now again actions that weve put in place in the second quarter of this year have probably a little bit more reduced effect on this year more effect as you exit out of into so its really a combination id say from a efficacy standpoint we are not taking or not continuing to take broad based actions at this point we stand ready to do that if something deteriorates but right now were continuing with our normal refinements which are more idiosyncratic at the partner portfolio product and channel level sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i have a question for brian doubles followup maybe you could just talk about the state of potential partnership opportunities or deals or portfolios has anything changed relative to the previous quarter thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure sanjay look i would say that we have a pretty healthy pipeline of opportunities that continues to be true i think competitively were certainly differentiated in terms of our technology investments how we partner synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 how we integrate and so that continues to resonate with both our existing partners but also new prospects so i feel really good about all of that i think look in this environment too whenever youre in an environment thats a little bit uncertain you tend to see more rational pricing a little more discipline across the industry which again is a good thing when we were in the headier days of things could get a little bit irrational when youre pricing at historically low loss rates we always price through a cycle well continue to do that but i think the environment right now across the industry across the competitive set is pretty rational so i feel really good about how were positioned and weve got a good pipeline of opportunities sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yes thanks sanjay brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks sanjay operator thank you our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody and thanks for taking my questions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc look id love to talk a little bit youve moved guidance to sort of the upper end of your prior range and im curious how much of that is a function of timing favorable timing with pppc implementation versus late fee how much is a function potentially of slower loan growth into the second half of the year and a favorable impact on reserves and whatever other fundamental factors might be driving that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question rick from a timing perspective i dont believe that theres anything significant in the timing of the execution id say from an execution standpoint i think weve hit all our deliverables given the process you have to go through to do the amount of changes in terms that weve done weve executed on the timeframe in the timeframes that we have in place and theyre rolling out according to schedule so theres nothing really timingrelated there synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 id sit back and say moving to the middle end of the range to the higher end of the range just really overall business performance i think we while purchase volume might be slightly lower than expectations it shows the consumer is managing we dont see them going under stress so i think as we look through the various elements our funding costs have stabilized and stabilized and moving into the back half of the year i think the expenses which we havent really talked about only being up including the cost of million related to the execution of change in terms otherwise would have been down i think is a positive as we move forward so i think were continuing to execute the business the business is really focused on what we have to do this year in order to execute both on the core business the reaction to or the pppc changes that were rolling out as well as the integration of ally lending which were very happy about and the disposition of pets best so the team is focused on execution thats what i would say drove us to the midtohigher end of the range richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great brian thank you very much incredibly helpful brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks rick operator thank you our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning everyone i wanted to ask about capital so in contrast to many banks that are still dealing with large aoci marks you guys appear to have greater clarity on the level of capital that youre going to need to run with and therefore it seemed like you may be in a better position to perhaps return the capital in excess of your target a little bit more aggressively relative to those who are still accreting capital to sort of plug that oci hole can you speak to that dynamic and how we should think about like the trajectory of that excess capital position relative to the target youve talked about historically brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks bill for the question weve been on a journey youve heard me talk about this a number of times when we separated from our former parent we started out and got to a peak of cet1 of and then theres been a journey down where today were at we have an excess relative to the target were continuing on the path right but our first priority is always going to be organic rwa growth our second is going to be the dividend and the third will be what we do with share repurchases or inorganic and brian talks about the discipline we have around inorganic growth so we have the ability to do that i think were going to be prudent with regard to the way in which we return back to shareholders were not going to just drop it tomorrow because obviously we have many stakeholders here who would not necessarily agree with that action but we are on trajectory and moving towards our target which is always been our longterm goal bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 thanks brian thats helpful and then i guess as a followup your expectation of stable reserve rate at the end of versus it seems like your expectation of a more favorable loss trajectory in your reasonable and supportable forecast period under cecl would be supportive of reserve releases all else equal so is the takeaway that your outlook is essentially derisked and now embeds greater conservatism just trying to get a sense for when youd feel comfortable getting that reserve rate back to the day one level and whether we should be thinking of that more as a event brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah most certainly its not going to be a event right as we said its flattish to last year it really goes back to when do we have greater clarity across across the industry everyone ph has greater clarity with regard to the macroeconomic when are we going to get back to a more normalized interest rate environment more normalized inflation environment which makes the everyday cost for our consumers a shared consumer across the industry much more manageable its that uncertainty that i think will give people pause in how they run the different scenarios and have their qualitative assessments thats probably the largest wild card obviously youre going to have to watch how your portfolio delinquencies develop and mix but its really getting clarity on that environment so again i think being prudent now is a better course bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood that makes a lot of sense thanks again for taking my questions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks bill have a good day operator thank you our next question will come from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc by the time we get to october the 1st will you guys have implemented your pppc at substantially all of your partners at that point or is there a segment that opted to wait on those until the rule actually takes effect and how large is that segment if you have a sense brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look as brian said weve completed the first phase that covers a substantial part of the business we do have one or two partners where weve largely agreed on what we would do but we are waiting for the rule to be synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 effective again that doesnt change our view that we will fully offset this we will get back to prelate fee roas and well still support the customers and underwrite the customers that we do today brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the only thing id add dave is there is a tail right with regard to this right because accounts that we originated in the back half of last year we wouldnt give them a change in term six months after we just originated or three months after we originated the account so there will be a tail that goes on here for a long period of time as well as the number of inactive accounts that become active once they become active theyll get a cit so it takes a long time to get to under any scenario but this will go on and thats part of normal course and any time we do a cit that is kind of regular course of action david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it that makes a lot of sense appreciate that and then to follow up on ryans question from earlier in the scenario where the late fee rule is shot down regarding the changes that stick i know you havent given this a ton of thought yet and thats understandable but just based on your early assessment of consumer reaction so far and your dialog with your partners and the fact that there is a good amount of expense associated with implementing those changes is there any reason youve seen so far to indicate you would want to unwind the apr changes or would those be the easiest changes to leave in place thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial look i think like brian said earlier this will be a discussion with the partners well look at for the portion of the book that we control well look at consumer behavioral changes its still really early these cits are now just working their way through the statements and were just starting to see the customer behavioral changes which at this point are very slight but we need to continue to monitor that as brian said were all over it and well adjust along the way if we feel like we need to but were not preparing for a scenario where the rule doesnt go into effect i think we have to control what we control and we control the pricing and policy changes and thats what thats what weve done and were obviously we think weve got a great case in terms of litigating the rule but its uncertain so weve got to focus on what we can control david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks dave have a good day operator thank you our next question will come from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys and thanks for taking my question actually i think all of my questions have been answered or asked and answered but i guess i have one incremental one is you did renew verizon in the quarter and then you added virgin i am wondering given i guess the overhang and uncertainty around the late fee situation how have there been any kind of structural changes in how you negotiate these new contracts with that uncertainty in the background brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so let me start and ill ask brian to comment look first were very excited to launch what we think is a very unique oneofakind program with virgin red itll span air travel hotel cruises were tapping into a very strong loyal customer base so we could not be more excited to partner with virgin red on this new product equally as excited to renew verizon its been a strong program for us great relationship and so were really excited about that as well certainly the late fee issue has crept its way into negotiations new business renewals unsurprisingly but there are ways to structure around this so we have certainly contemplated an late fee in every program that weve renewed since the rule was published as well as anything that weve extended brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the only thing id add john is in that structuring of pricing we assume late fees going at to the extent that there is upside were protected at the downside there may be things that you do on the upside relative to partners particularly even when you look at the portfolio required in the second quarter from another issuer were relatively protected or are protected relative to the late fee going into place its just were more conservative in pricing we think its going to as much as we like the chances that the industry has against the rule were not going to bank on it and are pricing a deal that lasts to years john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great appreciate the color guys thanks very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day operator thank you we have time for one last question it will come from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2024 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes can you talk a little bit about the vintage just how thats performing youve got another quarter under your belt relative to your expectations and maybe and i know you havent had as much indiscernible volatility versus general purpose brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question don so again i think level setting first of all id like to do it against the industry i think if you go and look to some of the credit bureaus and you look at the industry vintage curves our relative portfolios are performing better than the industrys curves both from delinquency and cumulative net chargeoff perspective that being said weve talked extensively over time that there is a shared consumer we do feel the effects of what other issuers did as they exited the pandemic adjusting some of their credit criteria or according to credit box in their world and issued an awful lot of some of the biggest vintages weve ever seen in the credit card industry so i use that as a background i think when you look at delinquencies and ill give you some of the details here don when you look at delinquencies the second half of through the first half of are performing slightly worse than or worse than vintage gets skewed because you have the year of the pandemic the second half and what we see and again it is very early but when you look at the early indications off of because of the credit actions weve taken they are performing better than the first half of and when you think about a chargeoff perspective the second half of and the first half of are performing better than so i do think some of the modifications that weve made in credit actions are supporting the vintages we have some of the shared consumer in that into partially into the back half of into early part of that has given us a little bit of the trends above our historical delinquency rate but again we feel good about how the vintages are developing donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks brian
