financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today let me begin by saying that were very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results earlier this morning we reported fullyear earnings of billion reflecting record pretax preprovision income of billion adjusted positive operating leverage of and industry leading returns on both average tangible common equity and total shareholder returns our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work thats taken place over the past decade to position the company to generate consistent sustainable longterm performance we have enhanced our credit interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on riskadjusted returns and capital allocation we made investments in markets technology talent and capabilities to diversify our revenue base and enhance our offerings to customers for example investments in our treasury management products and services led to record revenue this year similarly our wealth management segment also generated record revenue despite volatile market conditions and now were seeing positive results of our comprehensive strategy over the course of the year we grew revenue and average loans while prudently managing expenses further illustrating the successful execution of our strategic plan so as we enter it is from a position of strength our business customers have strong balance sheets they have benefited from population migration and many continue to carry more liquidity than in the past our consumer customer base remains healthy deposit balances remain strong and credit card payments remain elevated the job market continues to be solid with approximately two open jobs available for each unemployed person across the regions footprint regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 we have a robust credit risk management framework and a disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk our portfolios are more balanced and diverse than at any point in the past we have a strong balance sheet thats wellpositioned to perform an array of economic conditions we have solid capital and liquidity position to support balance sheet growth and strategic investments and most importantly we have a solid strategic plan an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution so as we look ahead although there is uncertainty we feel good about how were positioned now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans increased sequentially or yearover year average business loans increased compared to the prior quarter reflecting highquality broadbased growth average consumer loans declined as growth in mortgage enerbank and credit card was offset by the strategic sale of consumer loans late in the third quarter and continued runoff of exit portfolios looking forward we expect ending loan growth of approximately from a deposit standpoint as expected deposits continued to normalize during the quarter consistent with a rapidly rising rate environment average total consumer balances were modestly lower primarily driven by higher balance customers seeking marginal investment alternatives meanwhile the median consumer balance remains relatively stable still about above prepandemic levels normalization was more pronounced in the average corporate and commercial deposits which were down during the quarter as anticipated our business clients continued to optimize the level and structure of their liquidity position we experienced remixing away from noninterestbearing deposits to other options both on and offbalance sheet including those offered through our treasury management platform ending deposit balances have declined approximately billion yearoveryear in line with our previously provided expectations looking forward we do anticipate further deposit declines of approximately billion to billion in the first half of reflecting continued federal reserve balance sheet normalization seasonal trends and late cycle rateseeking behavior we expect to experience stabilization of deposit balances midyear with the potential for modest growth in the second half of the year our deliberate approach to managing liquidity allows for deposit normalization and growth in the balance sheet without the need for material wholesale borrowings in the near term so lets shift to net interest income and margin reflecting our assetsensitive profile net interest income grew to a record billion this quarter representing an increase while reported net interest margin increased basis points to its highest level in the last years while deposit repricing continues to accelerate the cycletodate beta remains low at importantly our guidance for assumes a full cycle beta by year end there is uncertainty regarding full cycle deposit betas for the industry however we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage growth in net interest income is expected to continue until the federal reserve reaches the end of its tightening cycle once the fed pauses we would expect deposit costs to continue increasing for a couple of more quarters this equates to to net interest income growth in the first quarter and to growth in assuming the december forward rate curve regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 earlier in we added a meaningful amount of hedges focused on protecting and the swaps become effective in the latter half of and and generally have a term of three years activity in the fourth quarter focused on extending that protection beyond we will look for attractive opportunities to continue to expand this protection we have constructed the balance sheet to support a net interest margin range of to over the coming years even if interest rates move back towards if rates remain elevated our reported net interest margin is projected to surpass the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice so lets take a look at the fee revenue and expense reported noninterest income includes million of insurance proceeds related to a third quarter regulatory settlement excluding that adjusted noninterest income declined from the prior quarter as stability in wealth management income and a modest increase in card and atm fees were offset by declines in other categories mainly mortgage and capital markets service charges declined due primarily to three fewer days in the fourth quarter versus the third we expect to offer a grace period feature to cover overdrafts around midyear and when combined with our previously implemented enhancements will result in fullyear service charges of approximately million within capital markets increases in ma fees were offset by declines in all other categories including a negative million cva and dva adjustment despite an increase in servicing income elevated interest rates and seasonally lower production drove total mortgage income lower during the quarter with respect to outlook we expect full year adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to lets move on to noninterest expense reported professional and legal expenses declined significantly driven by charges related to the settlement of a regulatory matter in the third quarter excluding this and other adjusted items adjusted noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior quarter salaries and benefits increased primarily due to an increase in associate head count during the fourth quarter and higher benefits expense equipment and software expenses increased reflecting increased technology investments the fourth quarter level does provide a reasonable quarterly run rate for we expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to and we expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately from an asset quality standpoint overall credit performance remains broadly stable while experiencing expected normalization net charge offs were basis points in the quarter excluding the impact of the third quarter consumer loan sale adjusted full year net charge offs were basis points nonperforming loans remained relatively stable quarteroverquarter and were below prepandemic levels provision expense was million this quarter while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at the increase to the allowance was due primarily to economic conditions normalizing credit from historically low levels and loan growth these increases were partially offset by the elimination of the hurricane related reserves established last quarter just to remind you we believe our normalized chargeoffs based on our current book of business should range from to basis points on an annual basis however due to the strength of the consumer and the businesses we expect our full year net chargeoff ratio to be in the range of to basis points regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 from a capital standpoint we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio at an estimated reflecting solid capital generation through earnings partially offset by continued loan growth given the uncertain economic outlook we plan to manage capital levels near the upper end of our to operating range over the near term so in closing we delivered strong results in despite volatile economic conditions we are in some of the strongest markets in the country and while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit remains broadly stable and capital and liquidity are solid now with that well move to the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc in terms of your deposit beta regarding that data assumption by year end what is your maybe help us think about what your assumption is around noninterestbearing mix as a percentage of total deposits how do you see that trending through the year whats underlying that assumption thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah john its david so what we did were at noninterest bearing right now weve always had more noninterest bearing than most everybody thats just the nature of our deposit base we said we would continue to see deposit runoff this year somewhere in the billion to billion range and for our guidance weve taken all that out of nib so you should expect that percentage of nib to decline somewhat during the year now thats just what we put in the guide we could see some mix changes from that nib and maybe thats the most harsh it could be so thats why we put it in the guide so i dont know if theres a followup there but john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay no thats helpful and i think that the color on the beta provides some of the additional detail but just separately if i could just hop over to credit for my followup the can you give us a little bit of color around what regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 drove the increase in chargeoffs in the quarter it looks like that may have been in ci but want to get a little bit of color around what youre seeing there are you seeing any stresses in certain pockets of your loan categories that youre watching that are starting to generate some losses and then also what drove the increase in the criticized loans thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah john this is john so we did see a little uptick in business services chargeoffs in the quarter related to a handful of credits weve identified couple areas or a couple segments of the portfolio where we see elevated stress at the office healthcare consumer discretionary senior housing and transportation on the small end of trucking in particular were seeing elevated levels of or elevating levels i should say of classified loans in particular so to the second part of your question we are seeing some normalization in the portfolio classified loans are increasing toward levels that we would expect to be more normalized and the categories in which that were seeing that change are the five identified but there are some odds and ends in the portfolio as well as inflationary impacts and rising rates affect isolated customers in general we still feel very good about credit quality and as david said were guiding to to basis points of chargeoffs in david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and john ill add if you look at page we tried to help you with the areas that john just mentioned in terms of the higherrisk segments and you can see on that page the strength of the allowance to cover those increases in the criticized level that we have listed in the supplement and we dont necessarily have loss and everyone those that migrated into criticized but what we do see we have already embedded in the reserve and its factored in as john mentioned in our guidance of to basis points in chargeoffs for john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yeah thanks david i appreciate that if i could just ask one more on that on the reserves you pretty much kept it stable this quarter can you maybe discuss the likelihood of incremental builds here or do you think it fairly represents the scenarios of outlook that youre looking at here david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well we certainly believe it represents what we think is the loss content that exists today obviously every quarter we have to reassess the economy the quality of the portfolio at those times so we think we have it covered the only bill that you would see from this standpoint that we know of would be related to new loan growth and were going to have some of that we said we would grow loans about endtoend during the year so well need to provide for that but we think at is a good coverage ratio for the risk that we have in our portfolio john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp based on our current economic assumption regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great thank you operator our next question comes from line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys i just want to follow up on the funding side of the balance sheet can you talk a little bit about you guys have had that ability to just keep your loantodeposit ratio in a good spot and just wondering if you kind of help us understand what you expect to do over time in terms of your wholesale debt footprint including longterm debt and what that would imply then for what you expect to do with the securities book over time as well thank you david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we continue to have one of the lowest loantodeposit ratios i think you were leading to that were in great markets we continue to work on growing accounts whether it be checking accounts or operating accounts thats the hallmark of our whole franchise is the strength of that deposit base so we will continue to leverage that deposit base in terms of our funding mix at least for the first half of the year we dont see the need to go into any wholesale borrowings we have plenty of access to that should we need it most of our peers i think have all tapped wholesale funding already so were being able to leverage that and thats where we give you the pretty strong guide in terms of our nii growth for the year of to so well see what the deposit flows are as we mentioned to john earlier the deposit outflows we see that we put in our guide is billion to billion now remember we said billion to billion this past year we were at billion so weve been estimating it pretty well and weve taken to offer our guide all of that out of nib so well see what happens during the year but dont expect us to be looking for wholesale funding until at least the second half of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just to follow up youre going to do that grace period and we saw you reiterate the million of service charges can you just kind of just give an update on the state of the consumer there and behavioral changes and any other learnings and findings that kind of continue to make you confident in upholding that million zone of service charges thanks regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah well ken we continue to see consumers maintaining good deposit balance levels spending is up modestly but we think being managed very carefully by our consumer customer base we feel good about the health of the consumer overall with respect to overdrafts and the changes that weve made to benefit customers weve seen about a decline in the number of customers who are overdrawing their accounts on a monthtomonth basis which we are happy about ultimately the objective is to help customers better manage their finances and so i would say all in all we feel good about our guide and good about the impact that the changes that weve made have had on our consumer customer base david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah ken let me add that embedded in the service charges is treasury management and treasury management has had a fantastic year if you look at the fourth quarter for treasury management we were up fourth quarter of to fourth quarter and if you look at the entire year we were up in tm so thats been a positive to us its helped bolster that downward trend of service charges due to all the account changes that weve made and will be a strength for us going into it gives us confidence as john mentioned that we can meet the million in service charges for the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning just a big picture strategic question obviously youve done an amazing job growing net interest income and getting the rate call right it seems like three for three here but i guess the flip side is the kind of revenue mix has become more dependent on rates and the balance sheet right as you think about the fee composition so anyway long story short the question is what strategic opportunities do you have to grow the fee revenues and maybe something thats more from an acquisition point of view to accelerate that john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well weve been as you know active making nonbank acquisitions particularly adding to our capital markets capabilities and were pleased with despite the fact that we had a bit of a soft quarter in the fourth quarter really pleased with the contribution that those capital markets investments are making to help us continue to regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 strengthen relationships with customers and grow noninterest revenues up pretty dramatically over the last six or seven years likewise we are excited about the investments weve made on the consumer side whether it be the acquisition of ascentium capital which is part of our corporate banking group enerbank which gives us a chance to grow loans to homeowners mortgage servicing rights that weve acquired which have been helpful and then in the wealth space weve made some acquisitions that have been modestly incremental helpful to us and we continue to look for opportunities there as well so we are i think positioning ourselves as we continue to accrete capital to making additional investments as we see those opportunities arise were consistently looking and i think you can look for us to continue to try to build on the investments that weve already made david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah matt let me add that so the fact that weve been able to grow niis is actually a positive thing we recognize it does lower the percentage of noninterest revenues in total but were very proud of the fact that weve been able to manage our balance sheet in this manner more importantly were trying to take the volatility out of that line item and so if you look at our ability to hedge were locking in what we believe to be a very strong margin range of to over time regardless of what the rate environment does and so that gives us a lot of stability there and if that means we have higher nii and the percentage of nir is a bit lower than theyve historically been were okay with that to johns point we are going to look to use our capital for some nonbank acquisitions like you have seen us do nothing too big but just to bolster the nir strength to make us more resilient in just about any environment that we have matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood thats helpful and then just somewhat related ive been asking a lot of your peers the same question but you all seem to be building capital kind of well beyond what i would have thought that you would need and youve talked about kind of the upper end to cet1 and thats not new but i guess the question is why are you and others potentially all building what seems to be well in excess of what you need for ccar are you anticipating something from ccar changing is there kind of pressure behind the scenes from rating agencies regulators or are just all the banks deciding on their own to be a little more conservative given the cycle where we are thank you john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah well matt we cant speak for the other banks i would say for us it is a bit of an uncertain time we think there potentially are opportunities to continue to make nonbank acquisitions will arise we were fortunate enough to make three in a short period of time at the end of and just operating at the upper end of our range gives us some flexibility and wed like to continue to maintain that given the uncertain environment that were operating in david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 and if you look at ccar degradation in capital was one of the lowest in the peer group so we dont need capital to take care of the risk embedded in our balance sheet is really opportunistic opportunities were looking for and frankly having a little bit more capital matt doesnt hurt us from a return standpoint we generated over return on tangible common equity and so having upper end of the wont impact in any meaningful way matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah agreed all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey a couple of questions one just on the loan growth outlook i know you indicated you expect ending balance to be about up yearonyear could you just give us a sense as to how youre thinking through the dynamics of which pieces of the loan growth are likely to accelerate be on the high side lower side and then how much longer that runoff portfolio is going to impact the numbers thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we expect loan growth to slow just with general economy slowing i think our growth opportunities will manifest itself in the corporate banking group commercial and corporate banking as line utilization likely goes up a bit i think there will be some opportunities in the real estate we did have some growth of real estate primarily multifamily still happy with that and we do have one of the lowest concentrations of investor real estate compared to the peer groups but we look at utilizing our capital selectively with the right customers doing the right things in particular like i said multifamily on the consumer side our enerbank acquisition we had in the end of as john mentioned is doing well for us were looking for that to have opportunities to continue to grow and mortgage while its going to be challenging again in because of the rate environment although its settled back a bit it will give us some opportunity to grow a bit in consumer side as you mentioned we do have some runoff portfolios our last one probably by the time we get to the end of this year were probably not having a discussion about exit portfolios anymore john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 yeah i would just add despite the fact that we expect the small business customer to be under some pressure in more challenged economy were seeing real opportunity through the ascentium capital platform making loans to businesses on business essential equipment were able to leverage that platform which is very specialized in nature through our branch system in our existing customer base and over plus of our branches in originated loan through ascentium capital well see more of that grow i think and again another opportunity to leverage an acquisition into our existing customer base betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah that was going to be one of my followups just trying to understand ascentium in this dynamic and the driver that it is for you and i guess the underlying question here is is it whats the average size of this loan an ascentium loan is it more of a small business size or medium or maybe give us some color around that john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah it is a small business its loans originated on equipment that is as i said business essentials so the thesis is that that business owner is likely to pay that loan first because he has to have he or she has to have the equipment to operate the business the average sized loan is about and the term would be three to four years on average betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then just lastly followup on the funding question that came up earlier i mean were hearing from others that borrowing from federal home loan banks is interesting even though the base rate sticker price might look a little higher you obviously get some dividend back from the swap you also get the fact that you dont have to pay the fdic so im just wondering is it at all attractive to you at some point to lean in more there or not david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think well need to evaluate with that closure when we get to the point where we needed we still have opportunities weve had a billion to billion worth of corporate deposits that are moved off our balance sheet to seek higher rates that we werent willing to pay those are our customers we own their still have their operating account theyve just moved their excess cash elsewhere so there is an opportunity to go back to those customers first before we need to seek other wholesale funding but i think we have all avenues we have term debt too that can help us with the fdic as well well just have to evaluate the total cost of all of our opportunities at that time which as i said earlier is really going to be in the second half of the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right you havent needed that at this stage got it okay thanks so much appreciate it david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp you bet regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 operator our next question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co good morning so its hard to pick apart anything in this quarter results were fantastic i guess the one question i get from people is as we start to see maybe some normalization in credit is how do you really highlight for folks how much different your franchise is today versus precycle i know youve laid some of that out in midquarter presentations the shift to investment grade and so forth but how would you combat that pushback from some folks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i think balance and diversity is the first thing i would point to when you look at pregreat recession our balance sheet whether it be on the right side or the left side assets or liabilities we had concentrations in certain asset classes and we were very dependent on interestbearing deposits for funding if you look at the reshaping of our balance sheet over time our the liability side of our balance sheet i think is really strong and provides as weve talked about to this point the foundation for our outperformance and we expect that will continue on the asset side of the balance sheet we have only less than of our outstandings are in investor real estate thats down significantly from precrisis levels and we also i think have been very very committed to concentration risk management we have a very active and ongoing credit risk management process which we believe will produce much better results than we have previously delivered were committed to consistent sustainable longterm performance and that requires that we manage credit risk well at the end of the day i know weve got to deliver and we intend to do that but we think were wellpositioned david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i would add that we also developed not too long ago a new tool we call it ph r click which doesnt mean anything to you but what it does is it analyzes the cash flows of each of our customers and we built that and developed that tool to give us an idea of a product and service that a customer may need from us that they dont have what we found is it gave us such good information on cash flows every month that it gave us an earlier indicator of potential credit stress and thats part of what youre seeing when you see us move things into criticized categories we can be more proactive because we have better information to manage credit risk management through that tool stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thats extremely helpful and maybe just one other question for me there is loan growth the guide i completely respect all the shifts and concerns in the environment that may take that down there but you put up growth this quarter utilizations continue to increase where could you outperform that i guess if the environment maybe wasnt as bad as we might fear and how do you think about that shift youve talked about into capital markets and what could really drive that pushing some of those customers back into that space regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp so were currently modeling about billion i think in credit outstanding that could move back could move off the balance sheet if capital markets open thats a rough number but thats give you some indication of a headwind if the capital markets do open so that could be a plus or minus to answer your question and i think would be the one area where we probably would see more growth than we anticipated if that did not happen david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah our line utilization still below historical levels every point increases about million in outstanding so if we get people drawing on their lines perhaps that could be helpful well see what the rate environment looks like with regards to mortgage well see what the economy looks like for consumers to improve their home and leverage enerbank so there are some opportunities for us to outperform those numbers if the economy kind of continues along its current path its still fairly healthy and inflations coming down so i think we have some opportunity to outperform there stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great appreciate the color thanks operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi john how are you hi david david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us you give us an interesting slide in your deck about how your deposit customers have more deposits in their accounts than prepandemic i think its slide have you reached out and whats driving these numbers because obviously you hear about the savings rate nationally is down but you and your peers are showing numbers like this and i was just wondering if you could share with us what your some of the trends that youre seeing here that keeps these balances the way they are david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 yeah the specific page on on the righthand side were talking about those customers that had less than in their account and that compared to the end of we have they have six times the balances a big driver is that cohort was the recipient of a lot of stimulus that stimulus could have come in the form of absolute transfer payments it could have come in the form of minimum wage increases those are permanent so what weve seen is that our customers actually are making more money and theyre keeping it theyre keeping their spending under control even though we have inflationary pressures so that cohort has had more wage growth than most everybody else and we dont see it going away were a bit surprised and were watching it every month to see if theres a change but i think the slide was fairly consistent with what we showed you last quarter as well so from a youre really talking about just the consumer on page but business customers continue to have more liquidity as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i got it so the wage growth theyre having better wage growth than most people on this call then right david david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yes sir gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc moving on to slide in the highrisk industry segments a couple of questions one can you share with us and maybe you addressed this already in the earlier comments on the slide but in the office space is it mostly the class b and c that or class b that youre more focused on than class a and then second could there be other industry segments that could show up in this slide months from now or months from now john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah gerard id say with respect to your question on office that would be accurate were focused on lets say the nonclass a of our portfolio is class a is in the sunbelt about of our portfolio is single tenant so the portion that we are concerned about would be class b space a good percentage of it is also in suburban markets i think in suburban markets in terms of industries or segments that we have some concern about i would say that were still watching senior housing closely i think its performed okay postpandemic but an area that we had some concern about rising cost availability of labor things that impact that particular segment and then consumer discretionary as people continue to feel the pressure of rising costs andor the uncertainty in the environment we think that and as unemployment begins to moderate a bit we think that consumer discretionary is an area that could be impacted gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions maybe first one i was hoping you could provide a little bit more details on i guess at slide in one of those footnotes specifically how the million security hedge benefit in the fourth quarter will and ill put in quotes there migrates to loan yield as those hedges on loans mature and i guess from a high level trying to make sure i understand the impact of that billionplus hedge on securities that matured last quarter david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah sure so what we did at the end of december of is we wanted to add some more sensitivity to the fourth quarter we had some hedges that were maturing in that fourth quarter that received fixed swaps but we wanted to move that and have those effectively terminate a quarter earlier we could have torn those up but it would have taken a lot of effort to do so because there are a bunch of small notionals in there and the cost and time to do that really theres an easier way to do it which is we purchased a payfixed swap for that quarter and so when that sensitivity came back it generated about million in the quarter now our sensitivity naturally comes back in the first quarter because we have received fixed swaps that are maturing right at the end of the year so that sensitivity came back naturally in the first quarter and thats why you wont see a decline due to this million that we had in the fourth quarter that is also why weve been able to give you guidance that were going to grow nii in the first quarter somewhere between and so its not a cliff you dont need to worry about having a cliff effect for it does that make sense terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc it does yeah then as a followup and i dont mean to be too cute but ive had a few people ask me if i look at your and full year nii guide does is the fourth quarter appears lower than the first quarter so maybe could you just talk about kind of the trajectory of nii as you think about it today david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well weve given you guide for the year of to up weve also given you a guide from the fourth quarter to the first quarter growth of to now obviously theres more pressure as after the fed stops raising rates for a quarter or two youre going to see deposit cost continue they lag so youre going to continue to see pressure after that its going to affect everybody in the industry that way and so youll see that decline at some point quarteroverquarter during the year so thats why its harder just to extrapolate fourth quarter but well see where the fed goes were our guidance is predicated on the december forwards if that changes and well come back and update our outlook but that gives you enough information to be able to model and do your sensitivities but yeah there will be some declines in nii based on the forwards sometime during regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right thanks for all the color have a nice weekend david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp you too john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you you too operator our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys nice quarter john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i had a followup on capital you guys had a nice bump up in ratios this quarter and just given the loan growth outlook youre talking about it seems like youll be at the top end of that target range for cet1 by the end of i know the buyback hasnt been a big priority for you recently but at what point do you think that it might make sense to turn it back on david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so as we think of capital allocation before i get there let me point out one thing we do have the impact of the regulatory change that will hit us in this first quarter as everybody thats about basis points working the other way so but your question is broader how do we think about capital allocation including repurchases so first off we want to use our capital to support our loan growth we want to pay a dividend in the to range weve been at the low end of that so we would like to operate over time and at least in the middle of that we want to use some of our capital for nonbank acquisitions in particular to bolster our noninterest revenue as we discussed i forgot who asked that question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 and then the kind of we use the share repurchase as the toggle would keep our capital where we want it to be which we said would be at the upper end of our range of we just think thats prudent with uncertainty overly negatively affect our return so if we go meaningfully over that we could turn on share repurchases and well just have to see how that the capital generation should be very strong in and we have should have enough to do all things i mentioned and if we cant put our capital to work doing a nonbank acquisition then well give it back to the shareholders david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay appreciate the color there and then back on the billion to billion deposit runoff outlook you talked about earlier i was glad to hear you you seem to go conservative with assuming all of that runoff was in noninterestbearing deposits i was curious regarding the big picture what youre seeing in the book that gets you to that billion to billion range and how sensitive is that to a stronger move up in fed funds if we end up seeing that and then how are you thinking about funding that runoff if thats going to come from the securities book which is lower rate or if youre assuming some of that or most of that comes out of cash at this point in your nii book david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah we have plenty of cash right now to take care of that runoff so thats not big deal that billion to billion theres some corporate changes in there thatll be seeking rates theres some consumer changes that are seeking rates historically movements like this happen late cycle so were getting there we all think that were getting towards the end of the cycle and so people will look to capture that upside so they can lock in the best rate before rates start going the other way so how much conservatism we have in there well see we had a pretty big runup in deposits billion during the pandemic and were holding on to quite a bit of that more so than we originally thought but i think itd be prudent to we think its prudent to put in this runoff of billion to billion and again conservatively all in nib david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 good morning morning could you speak to concerns that we could see the mix of time deposits and noninterest bearing deposits return potentially not just to precovid levels but back to pregfc levels in this environment youve given a lot of great detail on the strength of your deposit franchise but itd be great to hear your thoughts on sort of that risk both broadly at the industry level and more specifically for regions as we look at from here david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah youre breaking up a little bit but i think what your question was is how we think about time deposits versus noninterestbearing deposits and where will we settle out over time so were sitting here today at noninterestbearing there have been some movements out of that to from because we were over into cds so we do believe theres going to be some remixing thats built into our beta assumption of through the end of the year we still think well have more nib than most everybody because thats the nature of our deposit book very granular deposits in particular on the consumer side where we have leading primacy and that makes the difference so money goes in money goes out theyre not seeking rate they use it as their thats their operating account and so we believe that we will continue to see some decline in the nib again conservatively put billion out of that we think theres probably a chance that therell be it will all come out at nib but we thought that was the best thing to do from a guidance standpoint bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you and then separately i wanted follow up on your comments around the nim protection that you put in place how would you respond to the view that the downside protection that banks are putting on in this environment doesnt make a lot of sense because of the negative carry associated with it since the forward curve discounts everything that we see in the current environment youre effectively just investing at whatever the yield curve is wherever yield curve is at the moment david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well the most important thing to remember is our hedging strategy is not meant to generate increases in nii it is a risk reduction measure its a hedge is to protect us in low rates when you have a deposit franchise like we do that has lower cost than our peers and thats the way its been historically as rates come down we dont have a mechanism to protect our net interest margin because we cant lower deposit cost much as low as our peers can therefore we have to do it synthetically and thats what the hedge program does and we set these up generally forward starting so we dont have negative carry until they start or the risk of negative carry until they start and frankly if we do at that time that means rates are higher and the rest of our book is earning that much more and were okay with that what it means is yes it costs us a little bit in nii but we have leading margin so were okay and you cant think of it as a trade as some people talk about it as being a trade thats not what it is its a hedge to protect us in low rate bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2023 david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp okay operator thank you your final question comes from the line of jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning question on loan growth im just curious how much competitive retrenchment youre seeing from the banks you compete with most often and how offensive are you willing to get for credits that look really attractive indiscernible john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well i would say first of all plenty of competition out there and we dont while there are certain segments particularly real estate where there are some competitors who are not as active today for a variety of reasons in general the market is very competitive whether it be large banks regional banks smaller banks that we compete with and so weve got to be actively calling on our customers and our prospects and being very diligent in our activities making sure that were in the market in front of customer when were doing that we get opportunities with respect to how aggressive we want to be we dont change our approach to how we think about credit risk management how we think about pricing and structure we want to win because we have expertise because we provide really good ideas and solutions to customers and we think that that resonates and as a result has helped us continue to build on growth in our portfolios jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc great thanks a lot john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay so thats all the calls i think ill just end by saying were awfully proud of our results and the momentum that were carrying into weve worked hard over the last years to remake our business and to build a balance sheet and income statement and importantly a culture of risk management that will
