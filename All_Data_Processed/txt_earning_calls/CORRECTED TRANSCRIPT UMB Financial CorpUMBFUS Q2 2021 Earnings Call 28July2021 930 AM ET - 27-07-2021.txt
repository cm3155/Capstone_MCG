28jul2021 mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks everyone for joining us today our strong second quarter results again demonstrates the benefits of our diverse business model and our investment thesis which includes abovepeer loan growth and solid net interest income and fee income growth in all environments something that weve been able to do for many years second quarter highlights include average loan growth on a linkedquarter annualized basis excluding ppp balances and a increase in fee income additionally we announced that the board approved a or increase in our quarterly dividend as you saw in our release our provision expense was higher than previous levels due to strong loan growth and elevated chargeoffs which were driven entirely by one commercial factoring relationship excluding this credit event we would have had net recoveries in the quarter the underlying quality of our loan portfolio remains strong with nonperforming loan balances down from the first quarter as weve shared in previous quarters we have refocused our factoring efforts targeting largely transportation companies and small receivables and we are comfortable with the characteristics of this portfolio looking ahead with what we know today and the quality we see across our portfolio we expect chargeoffs to come in closer to our historical level of about to basis points for the full year of sentiment in our markets continues to move towards more normalized levels and our customers remain cautiously optimistic while keeping a close eye on the trajectory of the pandemic modified loan balances are down to just a handful of loans and those are slated to be resolved in the coming months as with many of our peers weve begun the transition to return our workforce to the office our banking centers have reopened weve begun to do more face toface client meetings and are working towards staggered returns of our nonbranch teams after labor day while we have maintained our highlevel productivity and customer service in recent months much of that was fostered by relationships ph up until summertime im excited for the energy camaraderie and collaboration that comes with seeing each other on a daytoday basis and with our customers more regularly turning to our second quarter results net income was million or per share and pretax preprovision income on an fte basis was million or a share slide shows the primary drivers behind our results and ill provide some highlevel comments then turn it over to ram for more detail net interest income increased from the first quarter as the positive impact and the strong balance sheet growth was mitigated by lower ppp income and some modest margin compression on a yearoveryear basis net interest income increased despite a 31basispoint decline in earning asset yields our track record for relative outperformance in asset growth and the opportunities we see for that to continue should allow us to grow net interest income over time fee income for the quarter increased on a linkedquarter basis impacted largely by a million gain in our position in tattooed chef compared to a million loss in the first quarter this gain included realized gains from the sale of million shares of tattooed chef as well as a marktomarket adjustment on the remaining million shares umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 as i noted earlier in the year equity investments similar to tattooed chef are part of our ongoing strategy to provide capital financing to our customer base across all credit structures and while we dont expect them all to have similar size we will continue to see liquidity events from time to time including a couple smaller pretax gains this quarter which totaled million and are included in our million in investment security gains one such investment a combination of mezzanine debt and equity yielded an internal rate of return of this included return on the equity portion of our investment upon the sale to another entity our focus on expanding our fee income businesses continued and we saw success across the company institutional banking provided more than half that fee income in both of our traditional corporate trust and specialty trust teams have experienced phenomenal growth yeartodate with new business dollar volumes increasing and respectively over the levels weve seen a resurgence in aviation financing activity and our location in dublin provides additional opportunities to capitalize on these trends internationally fund services assets under administration now stand at billion compared to billion a year ago and fund services contribution to fee income has increased over that time in investor solutions we continue to add fintech partnerships which weve highlighted on slide and this has been the best six months on record for public finance with deals closed yeartodate an increase of compared to turning to private wealth we now have billion in customer assets and were on track to exceed sales volumes from were beginning to see activity in our new family office offering and we have a solid pipeline there moving to the balance sheet slide is a snapshot of our loan portfolio showing strong annualized growth i mentioned earlier growth in ci came from a variety of industries across our book this quarter importantly approximately twothirds of that growth was from new borrowers commercial line utilization ticked up slightly to following a couple of quarters in the high in cre multifamily and industrial projects led the growth during the quarter and we continue to make headway in our expansion markets with utah among the top three average residential mortgage balances increased from the first quarter to billion funded mortgage loans for the quarter increased to million including million in the secondary market total top line loan production for the quarter was billion outside of ppp balance changes with payoffs and paydowns of of loans looking to the third quarter we see a robust pipeline in both ci and cre as we see opportunities to continue to gain market share in many of our underpenetrated markets and verticals on slide weve updated our exposure to sensitive industries as we moved further through the pandemic weve adjusted this list to reflect both the characteristics of our portfolio and the evolving outlook for various categories changes this quarter include the removal of retail cre based on our borrower performance and the composition of our book which is almost ph anchored by grocery stores loans in the remaining two categories hotel and senior living totaled million or of total loans excluding ppp after our typical analysis of mitigating factors including strong sponsors and guarantors we feel that approximately million or just under of our loans warrant a closer monitoring as always we are in constant communication with these borrowers our average loantodeposit ratio remains for the quarter and was including our held to maturity portfolio which tends to perform similarly to loans our differentiated customer base which drives diverse sources umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 of funding and revenue comes with larger deposit balances and deposit growth this quarter was driven by commercial banking and investor solutions along with the continued impact of recent stimulus payments finally as i mentioned the board approved a increase in our quarterly dividend this will increase our dividend payout ratio while still maintaining our priorities for use of capital our number one focus is to grow shareholder value through investing in growth both organically and opportunistically through acquisitions to wrap it up we continue to see positive momentum across the company and im pleased with our second quarter performance and im excited by the opportunities that we see in the second half of the year now ill turn it over to ram for a few additional comments ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner net interest income of million represented an increase of from the first quarter we realized million of ppp fees and the ppp contribution to the second quarter net interest income was million compared to million last quarter at quarter end our ppp balances stood at million down from billion at march approximately million in ph unamortized fees remain at the end of the second quarter average earning asset yields decreased basis points to due to 6basispoint declines in both loan and security yields and asset mix changes including the million decline in average ppp balances our levels of liquidity remain elevated with our fed account reverse repo and cash balances comprising of average earning assets with a yield of basis points down slightly from basis points in the first quarter the 3basispoint decline in net interest margin on a linkedquarter basis was driven by repricing pressure and mix changes in both the loan and securities portfolio as well as the lower ppp income i noted we continue to deploy a portion of excess liquidity as well as cash flows from our securities book into our afs portfolio as evidenced by the billion increase in average balances from last year portfolio composition and activity trends are shown on slide and during the quarter we had cash flows of million at a yield of and we purchased billion of securities that yielded so far in weve executed just over million of fair value hedges with varying delayed starts and seven year terms on average these are designed to mitigate earnings and capital impact in a rising rate environment these hedges are matched to longdated municipal bonds and fixed a portion of index funding cost and involve making fixed rate payments in exchange for receiving variable rate payments over the life of the agreements looking ahead the margin trajectory will largely depend on levels of liquidity pace and timing of ppp forgiveness and reinvestment rates on cash flows in the securities portfolio overall we would expect some additional modest margin pressure in the second half of this year noninterest income for the second quarter was million and contained a million pretax gain on the valuation of our ttcf investment compared to a million pretax loss in the first quarter marktomarket adjustments on the remaining million shares will continue to flow through the securities gain and losses line item within fee income umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 other drivers to fee income for the quarter were the additional gains from our capital corporate initiatives that mariner mentioned along with an increase of million in bankcard fees offset by lower trading and investment banking income and million reduction in trust and securities processing income as youll see on slide fund services income increased during the quarter offset by the impact of the sale of prairie capital management announced last quarter the full details of our various fee income line items are shown on that slide and mariner commented on some of the growth opportunities we have in several of those businesses noninterest expense trends are shown on slide expenses were essentially flat from the first quarter at million as the increases outlined there were largely offset by seasonal decreases in payroll taxes insurance and 401k expense as well as lower bonus and commissions our effective tax rate for the first six months of the year was for the full year we anticipate itll be approximately between to we continue to maintain strong capital ratios with our total riskbased capital at cet1 ratio at and leverage ratio at our tangible book value per share increased during the last months to at june that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question today will come from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hi jared ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just to start can we start with the factoring loss can you give us any details around that that seems like a larger loss im guessing its probably not tied to the targeted transportation and smaller receivables if its not large and then after that could you also let us know what portion of the book is still maybe a part from transportation and smaller receivables after this charge umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks jared i guess to sort of level set the whole deal i take you to page and just for all those on the call its a really great page to sort of summarize what credit really looks like at umb and youll notice on that slide that the past four quarters there were no losses especially ph when they were factoring loss and in this recent quarter without that loss we would have basis points of recovery for the quarter and as in previous comments weve made about factoring dating back to the first original loss we had this was an acquired business we changed out the management weve refocused the business as you said on transportation and smaller receivables and so that i guess id say thats all still true still the case weve refocused the business this particular credit as was identified back then and i guess id just ph repoint you to everything has been changed altered and we feel good about the business thats left its a very small business and it is as you said we focus on smaller and transportation credits and really overall the reality is significant reductions in our nonperforming on the company an excellent quarter inclusive of this loss and we expect to get back to our historic chargeoff rate by the end of the year for the full year of basis points or less in chargeoffs jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay was that loan included in nonperforming or classified loans before the chargeoffs mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp it was not it was not and yeah so that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp echoes the performance of our nonperforming loans so it is that much even that much better sort of describing the whole portfolio i think does really a nice job of just talking about our longterm trends and our track record on the call with me are the two guys that do that with me one has been with us years ph on and jim heres years so its the same team doing the same thing managing at the same way for a very long time jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just to finish this component up are there any other components of factoring that were identified in that are more along the lines of this loss or the loss back in mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no everything thats left in the portfolio are conforming factoring loans and are all performing umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay maybe shifting a little bit to expenses its good to see expenses came in on target from commentary before going back to fourth quarter you had expressed some potential optimism for positive operating leverage this year do you think were on track to potentially see that on a fullyear basis mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah if you back out ppp in future periods yes jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc back out the revenue or mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean next year you dont want to compare next year to this year with the ppp gains right so if you back that out i would say yes jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess indiscernible just looking at can you give any update on expectations or drivers for aua growth as we go forward through the rest of the year mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well thats at some level hard to predict a lot of that has to do with whats going on in the marketplace with asset values if youre talking about new business specifically the pipelines remain very very strong across all those businesses so id say pipeline very strong asset values is another is another question but ph definitely james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp new business in our private wealth management group is up and thats new business from new customers not including market action on the organic book weve seen unexpectedly strong sales activity and when i say unexpectedly just because were still in the covid environment which shows our sales forces getting out there and finding new business and being able to have facetoface appointments which has been part of what has made it successful over time so that has been nice to see the fund services business is continue to be strong there have been some delays in conversions just due to our clients being back in the office as well but we have signed contracts and a strong backlog there also mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 the only thing i would add there without naming names is a couple of our competitors major competitors in that space are struggling ph mildly right now so the opportunity is fantastic for fund service on a go forward basis jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks ill step back thanks operator the next question today will come from nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey nate good morning nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co pretty impressive loan growth in the quarter and its encouraging to see ph apparently ci line utilization increased in the quarter i think that is ahead of kind of what we see from some other of your peers so far in the quarter so would just love to get some color on the drivers for the increase in line utilization this quarter and just the overall ci growth that was again impressive and just kind of the outlook for overall loan growth in the back half of this year exppp mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah thanks its interesting the loan growth question ive been following the comments myself and i actually im just as interested as to why others arent seeing loan growth as to why people are interested as why we are seeing loan growth and my comments around that are weve at the backdrop youve got a huge stimulus in the market youve got ppp funds at the company level you got a monster level of liquidity you have recovering economy and for me thats the backdrop for loan growth so ive actually struggled to understand why others are talking about not having loan growth so for me its just sort of the basic backdrop of a nice recovery as a backdrop for our loan growth coupled with the fact that what weve said for years now is were underpenetrated geographically and underpenetrated vertically and we dont budget our loan growth based on multiple gdp like a lot of banks do we do ours based on the ability of our loan officers to build to execute on our pipelines and gain market share so with that backdrop for our pipeline and what weve seen and then able to demonstrate year in year out thats what drives our loan growth it comes across all categories and is in the prepared comments the ci side three quarters of that was new business from new customers on the line utilization i wouldnt get too excited one way or the other about that ph i would thats a point in time that thing can go bounce around a little bit what i would say is its stable i wouldnt point too much umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 one way or the other its up slightly on a point in time basis but what id say is its stable and so those would be my big comments there about it its business as usual for us on loan growth and i think that we typically give you a quarter ahead look and jim commented on that it looks as strong as it has been and just not nothing new on the loan growth front james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp and we did mention nate that we anticipated more closings in first quarter that did roll to second quarter so that did have some impact on the outsized growth for second quarter but third quarter remains strong and weve also seen a lift from our consumer mortgage business that weve placed on the balance sheet as well roughly million so thats been additive also nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just maybe shifting to capital wed love to get some updated excess capital deployment priorities what youre seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities as well and just any thoughts on the buyback with a little bit of a retreat in sectorwide valuations recently mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so in our prepared comments we talked about our priorities the increase in the dividend was really what i would call a catchup dividend increase to get us kind of level set with the kind of experience that our shareholders have been used to from us so thats what that was sort of a catchup get us back to our payout ratio that weve historically demonstrated as far as just the regular use for our capital we would very much like to find a way to deploy capital to grow our business obviously with the loan growth that we have thats the place its going to go first and secondly we love to find ma activity ma opportunities it wont come as a surprise to you that theres nothing to announce to you but we were asking for it we would very much like to add value to our business through some ma activity and all i can say about that is we remain active we remain were making phone calls ph were pounding the street using shoe leather building relationships and doing everything we can but were not going to do something just to do something right so its got to be something that fits culturally and really adds value were not going to do what i call a ticker tape acquisition one just to announce something its got to fit nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it looks great color if i could just ask one more on overall balance sheet dynamics as the ppp forgiveness process continues to unfold it looks like some of your commercial clients are working through excess liquidity and drawn online indiscernible expectation sort of deposit flows and just the overall size of the balance sheet over the back half of as well mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well thats the milliondollar question in it we debate that ourselves internally so its almost hard to answer that one when everybody on the phone on my end would probably give you a different answer but i think weve umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 theres definitely excess liquidity on our balance sheet whether thats billion billion or billion is anybodys guess and so i think theres some excess liquidity on our balance sheet but from our vantage point we are always focused on deposit growth and we always have the ability to bring deposits back on balance sheet that is off balance sheet ph if that were ever something we needed the other thing to think about for us which i think is kind of unique in the space is our loan to deposit ratio is so low to start with im not sure it really matters how much excess liquidity we have because really if some of our order roll off our ratios would just look better anyway nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co right got it okay thanks again for all the color operator operator instructions the next question will come from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey indiscernible this is andrew actually on for chris mcgratty ph thats asking question mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey andrew hi there andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just wondering so i noticed your fee income came up a little higher than expected can you just go into i guess the ph pieces of fees this quarter and what that run rate looks like going into the back half of half year thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean high level and ill let my team jump in if they want to add color but high level id say it came really across the board so in all of our assetbased businesses there was great business development new client activity the markets have been stronger than i think we all thought they would be certainly in my shop we have felt that way so really across all the assetbacked assetbased businesses the activities are very strong and in our corporate trust business with the economy opening back up aviation trust businesses come back on yeah i mean just really really saw it across the board in all of our businesses jim mentioned strong asset growth client growth in our private wealth business you want to add anything else jim umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp well we had additional swap income this quarter commercially we saw additional growth with the ph kca we announced that in our capital markets group the kcas another win in that group where we saw you saw that fee income on what page would that be in the deck mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp in the equity return on another investment james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp in another private investment obviously not as large as tattooed chef but obviously outsized return for our investments and really and ph manifests really across the board those would be a couple of the key highlights and then off the fee income on account fees mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i would like to come back to ph kca still youve seen the returns from tattooed chef we dont expect to see those kind of returns in that business every time but you should expect to see us see liquidity events in our equity investments on an ongoing basis and ph as evidenced by having one in this quarter andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great thank you and then just one more on the tax rate it looks like it came in a little higher than last quarter and the previous two quarters what do you think is a good run rate for the tax rate going forward thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah we would say to andrew for the full year every quarter we adjust the tax rate based on just expected earnings and everything else so tends to jump around a little bit but for the full year i would say to andrew leischner q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator the next question is a followup from nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi just a question going back to the discussion around fee income the public finance and trading line continues to perform i think fairly well and in the past youve talked about the upside of that business with umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 greater infrastructure spending so i just wonder if you guys could kind of quantify it the infrastructure bill ends up getting done kind of whats the earnings power thats yet to be realized within that line going forward mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thats really hard to judge theyre still debating it in the first place then you got to go through appropriation then its got to get distributed to state levels and then they got indiscernible a pretty long path its hard to tell you when we might see that so i dont know when we might see it certainly not in the next quarter i mean i dont know when well see that stuff its still hasnt even made out of washington yet james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp we can tell you though that we have approved and we are adding additional associates in that area or and we have seen success thats been documented as far as our activities and we do anticipate it being beneficial for us mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean some of what weve seen there too is taxable municipals have made their way into the marketplace in a meaningful way so that some of the business weve been underwriting is taxable municipals so the market is changing and theres a lot of liquidity i think the real key here is regardless theres an enormous amount of liquidity so institutions and banks are needing to deploy it the commissions are different based on the kinds of securities that are being traded and built and sold but theres a lot of activity still because of the liquidity and thats what youre seeing and i think youll continue to see that probably up till the time through until the time that we do benefit from what might happen from infrastructure nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and just one other question around expenses with the institutional segment still performing well im curious if theres shift in kind of the structure of incentive compensation i believe historically that business has had a higher variable comp component to it historically so im just curious if any of thats shifted more recently that kind of supports kind of how expenses have been a little bit more controlled in terms of overall growth recently mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no i would actually say the opposite some of the expense growth that we do have is from paying out on commissions and sales james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp right mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 28jul2021 so its been more controlled than the other areas in the in this what expense increases we have had because of sales activity weve tried to be more balanced over time to make sure that our sales officers are bringing in the business that we all the different types of business that we offer so thats where we continue to tweak our sales incentive is to make sure that our officers are become more generalists and specialists when it comes to selling all that we have to sell and jim james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp yeah no we make sure that our incentives are balanced with what is in the best interest of the bank such as additional incentives ph cross even though we i dont know the industry likes this term very much anymore as far as crosssell activities but we make sure were partnering with the other lines and exposing different lines of business to different customer bases where they can have referral activity that makes sense we were rewarding that activity more handsomely than in the past which where it benefits the bank but just like any organization we constantly evaluate our programs but they have not changed drastically or were not seeing pressure from the market to do that we believe were extremely competitive and actually the employer of choice for all our divisions ph thats a little plug for umb for na mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co of course very good super helpful i appreciate all the color again thanks guys mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial
