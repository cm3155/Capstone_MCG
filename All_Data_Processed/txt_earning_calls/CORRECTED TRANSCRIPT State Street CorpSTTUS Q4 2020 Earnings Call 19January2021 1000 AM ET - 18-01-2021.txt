morning we released our fourth quarter and full year financial results before i review our results i would like to reflect on how state street successfully adapted to the unique operating environment in supporting our clients communities in the financial system all while advancing and positioning the business for future success was a year like no other in recent memory as we entered the year few could have predicted how volatile the operating market operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the covid19 pandemic resulted in a global economic recession which the world is still dealing with against that backdrop governments central banks and financial institutions like state street needed to act quickly to assist in limiting the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy also highlighted a number of racial and social injustices that we must act to address when faced with these economic and social challenges i am proud of how state street team members around the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in as the pandemic worsened last year our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver products services and results for our clients when they needed us most in addition to the clientfocused product and service enhancements we made in we continue to transform our operating model by simplifying our operations increasing automation and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our business state street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last two years and we expect that well be able to deliver further improvements during to drive cost lower selffund investments for the future and transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead at the same time the volatility in markets demonstrated the strength of our global fx franchise where we retain the number one market share position with asset managers and achieved an approximately uptick in revenue we continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout with the further development and delivery of the state street alpha fronttoback fronttomiddletoback platform which has gained traction with clients through the open architecture nature of the platform we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers unlocking new sources of revenue we signed six alpha clients in where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development the alpha pipeline remains strong while the alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy we also remained laserfocused on improving the financial performance within investment servicing which is the core engine of our business weve recently enhanced our institutional services clientfacing strategy and during we will leverage improvements in client coverage segments and regions to broaden and drive investment servicing revenue growth over time as a result our strategic moves the strength of our capabilities and operating model and the state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of and improved yearoveryear financial performance which i will now discuss further turning to slide fourth quarter eps was or excluding notable items relative to the year ago period fourth quarter total revenue declined largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our nii results however fee revenue increased reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing and management fee performance as well as strong fx trading results despite an increase in transaction processing total expenses were flat yearoveryear excluding notable items at the end of the fourth quarter auca and aum both increased to record levels supported by higher period end markets at global advisors we had another strong performance in etfs and cash these results in both businesses provide good stepoff points for turning to our full year results we made solid financial progress relative to as we work to drive fee revenue growth higher and total expenses lower full year eps was or excluding notable items eps results were up and excluding notable items despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment supported by yearoveryear improvements in servicing and management fees very strong fx trading results and a higher revenue contribution from crd which continues to perform well total fee revenue increased however total revenue was roughly flat yearoveryear as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on nii our team drove total expenses down yearoveryear excluding notable items as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in operating leverage was positive and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history to conclude my opening remarks state street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during as a result of our operational capabilities and innovation we were able to successfully navigate those challenges all the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid yearover year earnings growth for our shareholders as we look ahead for the first quarter of our board has authorized up to million of common stock repurchases which is in effect the limit set by the fed we are well positioned for and looking forward to returning significantly more capital to shareholders in the future in addition the board has also authorized the partial redemption of our series f preferred stock which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial redemption in the first quarter and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail and then i will return to update you on our mediumterm targets eric w aboaf chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone turning to slide and before i begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year results let me briefly outline million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter which totaled of eps that will collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 first we took an employee severance charge of million to eliminate approximately positions mostly in middle management which will be partially offset by insourcing and critical hires during the year this complements the senior management reductions we made two years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior roles through automation that were deferred during the covid19 pandemic we expect this to generate savings of approximately million in and about twice that in the following year second we took a million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across sites by about million square feet or approximately of our total square footage this is the start of our process of reconfiguring our office space for a post covid environment we expect this action to generate savings of roughly million in we try to minimize repositioning charges but we have delivered two years in a row of underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in turning to slide i will begin my review of both our and full year results as you can see on the top left of the table we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues total fee revenue increased yearonyear and was up quarteronquarter and while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind the absence of the million third quarter trueup combined with a strongerthanexpected balance sheet growth led to a quarteronquarter improvement in nii total expenses exnotables were flat yearonyear but increased quarteronquarter including currency translation and higher variable costs on the right side of the slide we show our full year performance and despite the challenging operating environment dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension of buybacks we delivered full year positive operating leverage of percentage points a basis point improvement in pretax margin and eps growth rate of excluding notable items our gaap results were even better across the board turning to slide periodend auca increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to a record trillion the yearonyear change was driven by higher periodend market levels client flows and net new business installations quarteronquarter auca increased a result of higher periodend market levels and better client flows at global advisors aum increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to trillion the yearonyear and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher periodend market levels coupled with net etf and cash inflows but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product line our spdr etf business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows driven by strong us and european flows taking total net etf inflows to over billion for the full year almost higher than last year now on to slide fourth quarter servicing fees increased yearonyear including currency translation the increase reflects higher average market levels softerthanexpected sales in as well as lower levels of client activity and normal pricing headwinds servicing fees were flat quarteronquarter including currency translation as higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity on the bottom left of this slide we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business auca wins totaled billion while auca yet to be installed amounted to billion in the fourth quarter as we look ahead we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds which we think is about trillion or more of net auca each year the amount of gross wins needed to offset these factors will vary yeartoyear and be impacted by a number of factors including product mix this would include alpha mandates which were over of our second half state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 auca wins though as i have mentioned before the sales cycle and installation of these more complex solution focused services take some time in weve had some strong success in growth across our top asset manager clients as well as within our insurance and asset owner client segments we have been disappointed however with our sales to our mid sized asset managers in north america and emea and are implementing a plan to address these areas of opportunity on the bottom right panel we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our institutional services strategy which involves expanding coverage to the total of our top clients and diversifying our pipeline across segments and geographies turning to slide let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail before i begin you will notice that for the current and prior periods we have reclassified the aumbased fees that global advisors receives for acting as the marketing agent for the spdr gold etf from fx trading services into the management fee line going forward we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at global advisors inclusive of this reclass fourth quarter management fees reached million up both yearonyear and quarteronquarter including the impact of currency translation yearonyear management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong etf inflows i mentioned earlier partially offset by money market fee waivers of about million net institutional outflows and the timing of cash outflows our fourth quarter investment management pretax margin reached which you can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum and we generated significant positive operating leverage regarding money market fee waivers we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of million to million per quarter companywide in which is included in our outlook that i will discuss further shortly fx trading services had another strong quarter fourth quarter fx revenue increased yearonyear and was up quarteronquarter demonstrating the strength of our topranked fx franchise for asset managers year onyear and sequentially fx revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect fx volumes as well as stronger marketmaking revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of everchanging economic and political conditions the full year fx revenue surge of approximately will obviously make the yearonyear comparisons more difficult fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell yearonyear primarily driven by lower enhanced custody balances and agency spreads securities finance revenue increased quarteronquarter however mainly as a result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some leverage reemerge finally fourth quarter software and processing fees were down yearonyear due to lower onprem crd revenue software and processing fees increased quarteronquarter as a result of sequentially stronger crd revenue and positive marketrelated adjustments moving to slide we show crd revenue growth and business performance metrics we have again separated crd revenues into its three categories given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the asc revenue recognition accounting standard for onprem revenues in particular state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 fourth quarter crd revenues fell yearonyear largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of but was up strongly at quarteronquarter on higher renewals crd demonstrated very strong revenue growth for the full year driven in part by the success of the crd wealth strategy earlier in the year with total standalone crd revenues up yearonyear and with the more durable saas and professional services revenues growing relative to full year on the bottom right of the slide we show some of the highlights of the state street alpha fronttoback platform sales during in total we signed six alpha clients during the year including three in which included one new client and two clients converted from existing relationships the alpha pipeline remains promising as clients begin to realize the transformational potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management needs turning to slide fourth quarter nii declined yearonyear but was up quarteronquarter the quarteronquarter increase in nii was driven by the absence of the million trueup in the third quarter not including that trueup the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans coupled with a billion of higher average deposits which were worth about million and approximately million of episodic fx marktomarket swap benefits over quarter end were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields each quarter we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical actions in some quarters well be able to fully offset the headwind like we did here as we put the billion of the deposit surge to work but that wont be the case every time on the right side of the slide we show our endofperiod and average balance sheet highlights last quarter i noted how we expect to operate around billion of average deposits but that our deposit levels might increase given the feds continued expansion of the money supply as it turns out weve begun to see the tailwind and now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposits and more in line with our fourth quarter average or even higher we will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment portfolio but we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for oci risk from interest rate changes on slide weve again provided a view of the expense base this quarter exnotables so that the underlying trends are readily visible expenses were held flat yearonyear but increased quarteronquarter excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation which was worth about point in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and exnotables we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and benefits while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat however this was more than offset by higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter transaction processing increased quarteronquarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes subcustody balances and brokerage volumes other expenses rose quarteronquarter as a result of higher marketing and professional fees for the full year total expenses were down approximately exnotables relative to demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we continue to reduce expenses selffund state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth we want to be down again in which i will detail shortly moving to slide on the left of the slide we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in as we supported clients with the mmlf and we thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support nii on the right of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios as you can see we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels relative to our regulatory requirements as ron noted we are excited that our board authorized a new common share repurchase program for the first quarter up to million and which is in line with the new fed limits were also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming million of pref stock which will have a benefit to our common stockholders starting in turning to slide you could see a summary of our and full year results ive already covered fourth quarter in detail so let me say a few words about our full year results given that weve been on a journey to turn around growth and improve margins and returns following a decline in total fee revenues in full year we successfully drove a increase in total fee revenue growth in full year many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen following a decline in servicing fees in full year we intervened to moderate pricing pressure we revamped our coverage of our top clients and we executed on our alpha strategy leading to an increase in servicing fees by yearonyear which made for a real turnaround at global advisors despite a challenging year on our longterm institutional index product line our etf business had a very strong year with total flows up yearonyear and our cash business performing quite well our fx trading services business had a remarkable year in as a result of higher market volatility and record client volumes and we reaped the benefit of our prior investments in our number one position with asset managers on expenses for the full year we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive cost out of the business recording a second consecutive year of total net expense reduction excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition of crd all the while investing in our products and capabilities all told excluding notable items state street delivered full year operating leverage of percentage points a basis point improvement in pretax margin and eps growth of notwithstanding some of the interest rate headwinds and gaap results were even stronger across the board all that said we have more to do in so let me get into it turning to slide let me cover our full year outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of as i usually do let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year at a macro level our rate outlook assumes that shortend rates remain relatively flat and there is some modest deepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment speeds were also assuming around to percentage sic to point to point growth from equity markets in as well as normalized market volatility which impacts our trading businesses state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 so beginning with revenue we currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up for and fee revenue extrading will be up to this includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the to range regarding the first quarter of we expect fee revenue to be down yearoveryear by low singledigits perhaps down to given headwinds such as the outsized fx trading revenues we saw last year due to volatility in the early days of the pandemic in march regarding nii we expect full year nii to be down to on a yearoveryear basis as investment portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments regarding first quarter of we expect nii to be down about to sequentially driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound assuming that our rate assumptions do not change significantly turning to expenses as you can see in the walk we expect expenses exnotables will be flat to down on a nominal basis in due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization and currently assume that currency translation will be a headwind in this estimate this net expense reduction includes approximately to of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like crd alpha and tech infrastructure and automation regarding the first quarter of we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide yearoveryear and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter we also expect releases of provisions for credit losses during of at least a third of what was built in taxes should be in the to range for and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thank you eric turning to slide i would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium term targets which we now aim to achieve by the end of on a run rate basis for at this time we still consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders as a result they remain unchanged as you can see from the slide however we now expect these targets may take longer to achieve than we had initially anticipated largely as a result of exogenous factors we set these medium term targets in early december soon thereafter interest rates fell as the fed tried to stimulate a slowing economy in and then again as covid hit in the market went from expecting in the fed to approach by late to ending at basis points with no rate hikes expected until at least meanwhile long end rates also fell from about the level at the time we gave the targets to average just basis points during all told we estimate that the sharply lower rate environment since has impacted our pretax margin by about percentage points and roe by around percentage points we also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late followed by a steady rebound in us equity markets but international equity market averages over the last two years were down while we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets we have made real progress we went from a decline in fee revenue in to a growth in fee revenue by reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our global markets business state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 we are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provide while at the same time enhancing our investment servicing capabilities and client coverage distinguishing us from our competitors weve also systematically reduced net expenses ex notable items which has helped us begin to close the margin gap to our peers by about percentage points we remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong expense results in summary though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium term targets im confident in the direction of our business and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients needs and drive business growth while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals and with that operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you good morning everybody so first eric for you maybe just to clarify some of the comments you made around servicing fees so you talked about trillion in sort of annual client attrition is that a thats about i think of your auc auca is that sort of what we should be thinking about as kind of like a gross impact on revenues as well and qualitatively how does that compare to prior periods has anything changed that sort of drives this churn higher eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp alex its eric thanks for the question were trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business because at the end of the day that is part of what we do every day and we do it across segments across regions across client groups and i think to kind of give you some perspective on that we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business right so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get which is a few percentage points and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth we need about trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that and we think thats what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we like to see now in truth weve not gotten there this year this year net new business was flat and you saw our auca wins at about billion and so its just obviously an area of pretty intense focus but i think its the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on if you step back weve made really good progress on our top clients where we rolled out a coverage process and set of executives about two years ago and weve seen the growth there weve seen it in a couple segments and now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of franchise ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah alex id like to just add to that i would not want to leave you with the impression that theres a client retention problem here if anything client retention has gone up but if you think about things like what the market state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 is facing in terms of reduction in funds for example or if you think about ma oftentimes that presents an opportunity for us so theres a small amount of attrition broadly defined its as much asset attrition as it is client attrition and what were trying to be here is very clear on how we think about what we need to do from a sales perspective and what were doing about it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you that clears it up a bit speaking of ma ron wanted to ask you a question around ssga obviously theres been several headlines around potential strategic actions state street could make around its asset management business and in the past you also talked about the drive for scale in that business just like what youre trying to provide to your clients so maybe you can update us in your latest kind of strategic thinking for ssga when it comes to either acquisitions or divestitures obviously there was a jv headline out there as well and as you think about sort of these various avenues what is the ultimate kind of financial and strategic goal youre trying to achieve for state street as a whole when it comes to ssga thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah alex im not going to comment on market rumors but what im going to say is what ive said before we have a very strong franchise in ssga its particularly strong in the etf space the cash space the indexing space its got a increasingly strong position in esg having said that as weve said before we see the world evolving and therefore we need to think about how to add capabilities both product and distribution capabilities or distribution access to this so its not new any time you ask us about this i think i answer it more or less the same way that were constantly thinking about this weve made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability for example fixed income etfs esg capabilities we launched the lowcost range of funds we created the distribution arrangement to help propel those lowcost funds so we will continue to look at those things and well continue to look at inorganic activities if we think its the best outcome and to answer the last part of your question what were looking to do is to best position ssga for growth its a remarkable asset its got a lot of potential and well do what we need to do to best position it for growth alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah for sure great thank you very much operator your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone hey eric just a followon on the nii side just wondering if you could help us understand you talk about some type of stepoff from fourth to first in terms of nii and then stabilization and i was wondering if you can walk us through the pieces of what are still moving through other than day count in the state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 first quarter and how much premium ph am was in the quarter and is that part of a rate of change that you can see any type of helped that stabilization or benefit thereafter thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp ken its eric sure let me describe first maybe third quarter to fourth quarter to give you some context and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of what we see from there going into the fourth quarter we have the usual headwinds from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than weve had previously and that would cost us sequentially about million thats kind of the headwind that will come back because that headwind is attenuating each quarter but that was a headwind against that headwind in the fourth quarter we had some unusual benefits we had the fx swap marktomarket which was about we had a surge in deposits both in developed markets and in emerging markets remember theyre valuable in emerging markets worth about as a tailwind and then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans to the tune of about million and that was a larger build than usual but a remunerative one and so those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from to i think if we go into first quarter you kind of take each of those in pieces the investment portfolio headwind its probably going to be about million instead of million so you see it attenuate and part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral we think from to we have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments but thats probably worth about and then we still have a couple headwinds we have the unwind of that swap marktomarket which sequentially its worth because you got to double up the positive turns negative and then you have day count worth another as a headwind so thats kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave once we get through the first quarter i think what we expect to see is that stabilization and what were effectively expecting is that investment portfolio headwind which was million becoming million is going to start to trend down to million a quarter and why is that partly rates have been kind of working through the on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates and so we do expect some lesser headwinds and against that we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus million and so well be roughly neutral and stable from to and to and so forth obviously it will be range bound and obviously theres always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into but thats our best estimate of what were seeing today based on the curves the expectations of rates and so forth ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc so eric sorry if i can speak that back at you does that mean kind of a millionsomething decline fourth to first if i got all your add ups there million million and million and million and million just trying to understand what that all gets to eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah i think i said to so i think were looking at a state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp whatever million decline in the first quarter and then stable from there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay sorry got it understood all right great thank you and then just one followup on a big picture of unfortunately another news item to ask you about were going on now i guess nine months since the blackrock etf headline news was out there as well and i know its a specific client but if theres a way to just helping us understand just what needs to happen for that to either be codified as youre keeping it or going away just any commentary would be helpful thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah that process is still underway were working very closely with them they have not made any decisions at this but we are feeling reasonably positive about them eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp and ken its eric id also just remind you though that is a growing ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp its a growing business a growing asset at quite a high pace right and so i think the last time we had one of these it took three years from start to finish to kind of work out from discussion to rfp to response and so forth and so i think theres you just have to factor that into any scenarios that you run ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood thank you operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc hi thank you and good morning this is adam beatty in for brennan just wanted to focus in a little bit on some of the softness you mentioned in the us and emea midmarket space and wondering if you could help us maybe state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 size that a little bit recognizing your efforts to broaden and diversify the business just in terms of the core of what youve got right now either maybe size it or talk about the impact that had on your guide and also interested in any interaction with the activities of the pricing committee there in terms of either structuring pricing or what have you in order to better retain or win business thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure adam its eric let me start i think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments right we have asset managers we have asset owners we have insurers and our business is more geared to asset managers than the other segments and so weve historically built our franchise there but weve actually had quite a bit of success in other in those other segments as well within asset managers what were starting to find is over the last year last two years the last year in particular weve actually secured more growth in the largest of the asset managers theyre obviously winning when you look at the external data and either less growth or in some cases decline in the midsize and smaller asset managers and so what and that gap can be that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a percentage point growth gap it could be a or percentage point growth gap it bounces around and so what were finding is that we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focused on the largest of our client but our midsized clients are really an important part of our franchise we built our franchise on them we provide really i think outstanding products and capabilities and were finding we need to spend both senior time on the midsized clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives and so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer and make sure were top of mind that were building on share of wallet ive got share of wallet statistics for top clients and that includes the midsized players and really executing in that area day in day out product product product product its literally down at that level of granularity where were focused now adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thats helpful on the dynamics thank you and then just a quick followup on mbs prepays and i appreciate the detail from before on that recognizing of course that interest rates will be the main driver there do you feel as though this past year there was any type of pullforward in prepayments or refinancing such that a reversal and downward tick in rates might not generate the same level of prepays as previously or is it very much still linked to rates thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp adam its eric i always like to hope that prepayments are burning through that theres been a onetime pop and then theyre going to attenuate but ive learned that hoping isnt a strategy right we just have to operate through the environment i think what weve seen is certainly a surge of prepayments starting in the end of right once people figure out how to do the paperwork during covid in and and our best estimate is informed by the various modeling providers we subscribe to three or four of them because we need that diversity of opinion suggest that prepayment speeds should probably continue into the first state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 quarter and then will begin to edge down from there in the second quarter and the third quarter with some stepwise improvement that said i think weve got to live through time here and just to see how it plays out and well know more what were trying to do though is make sure that were always taking the actions that we can on investment portfolio on deposit reinvestment on loans because thats something we can control and we need to stay focused on those actions adam q beatty q analyst ubs securities llc fair enough thank you eric operator your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc this is ryan kenny on behalf of betsy good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp morning ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc so we saw the occ stablecoin approval come through earlier this month just wondering if that has any impact on state street and how youre thinking about your blockchain strategy going forward ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yes ryan this is ron in terms of direct impact first the occ doesnt regulate us and secondly it directly impacts or if you will poses most challenge to the payments banks for us in general its probably neutral to positive because anything that stimulates more interest in blockchain and particularly more interest in digital currency is going to create a custody opportunity for us and we have been investing fairly significantly in that space as weve said in the past blockchain itself is actually quite an important part of lots of things that were doing in custody and asset servicing and increasingly we see digital coins cryptocurrency as part of the holdings within our client base and well continue to invest in that but the occs work itself is i would say not directly relevant to us at this time ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks and then one quick other question wondering how we should think about the impact from money market fee waivers in is it in the run rate now or should we expect any uptick from here thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian sic ryan its eric a good part of it is in the run rate i think we said about million in we do expect it to tick up one more step and were now expecting about million to million a quarter in the coming year so i think were much less exposed than others we dont have retail money market funds we dont have high net worth funds with higher fees so but those are the figures ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator your next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great good morning folks eric maybe just to continue on the net interest income guide for just if you can just talk about your earning asset assumptions for the year and deposit growth strategy realizing obviously they spiked up in but as youre building your servicing business and youre trying to enhance some of the deposit strategies maybe if you could talk about that and your assumptions for and then in fact also on the premium amortization i think you said million from to so is that about a million level just wanted to fact check that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian its eric let me do those in reverse order i think the the million was the headwind were seeing on a quarterly basis from to in the investment portfolio and that was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because were still living through that wave what i then said is that to we felt the combination of the investment portfolio headwind including premium amortization would be about a million headwind and then i said starting in second quarter we thought it would trend down even further to closer to million million and million in those outquarters each quarter so i think what were starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation which partly is the kind of ph tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards in terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy on deposits its really hard to gauge the fed continues to expand the money supply by what about billion a month were or of the deposits so we pick up deposits just by being here every month so theres some amount of tailwind its just really hard to read given lots of talk about stimulus bills asset allocation and reallocation from riskon to riskoff to barbelling so i think right now were assuming that were going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits with probably a little bit of edging up and so were not at this point expecting yet another surge but you just dont know and i think well obviously respond if it happens state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 in terms of asset strategy thats a tough one i think its tough for us and for every other bank because we can certainly take some risk on the curve but you dont get paid very much for it and so i think theres a balance that were making which is how much dry powder you want to keep and so then when you do see a spike of interest rates you can edge or leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the shortterm and our investors are always kind of carefully thinking about that trying to be opportunistic and will come and go and well do that in treasuries around the curve mbs youve seen us build up our mbs book over the last year by a solid billion i think we want to just be careful there we prefer some of the prepaymentprotected subsegments weve done a little bit of credit we want to be careful there too because credit is impacted during the ccar and scb process so its a pretty diversified approach i think is the core of our strategy looking for opportunities and i think as we see some of those well act and well certainly report on them to all of you brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats great color thank you and then just back to the trillion that you mentioned of growth servicing wins to offset some of the headwinds can you talk about the crosssell portion of that so this would be adding different new services to existing clients maybe how thats sort of tracking within that outlook and then also the importance of ssgas indexing business as they crosssell to asset servicing clients ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah brian its ron crosssell is a very big piece of this i mean if you think about what eric said earlier you look at performance it was largely the same in the fastestgrowing segment or the segment that accounted for the most growth was in fact our global client division which is our largest client so by definition we werent adding many to that if any but what we were doing was growing substantially in there and that will be a key part of our growth going forward for both traditional asset servicing products as some of these institutions continue to consolidate providers but also for fronttoback alpha activities as we either fully install alpha or even put charles river in a situation where we have the middle and the back office but not the front so thats a key part of it as we think about the numbers certainly the ability to have common clients where were both the asset servicer and the indexer is attractive we always look for those opportunities thats not in the assumption that erics describing there so what we really were trying to do here in response to many questions weve gotten is more or less dimension of what we need to do to grow revenue obviously that number its based on averages so to the extent to which in a given year or a given quarter were bringing in higher fee kinds of assets then obviously the trillion goes down so thats the way to think about it you could never at the end of any particular quarter say well if youre not a quarter of the way there are you making it or not making it youve got to go one click down and say what was the nature of the kind of underlying business which youll be able to understand from us brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thats helpful thank you state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks brian operator your next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research your line is open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research you called out some reduced client activity is pressuring servicing fees in the fourth quarter just wondering how that played out with respect to expectations and then more qualitatively the level of client activity youre thinking about into the outlooks for next year well this year eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah rob its eric there are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds tailwinds of our servicing business client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients because theres some tolling that we do for that in particular cash and derivative trades tend to more likely have tolls than others just because theyre a little more complicated etf creation redeem that kind of stuff so its a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify but has a long list of kind of volumetric elements i think on a yearonyear basis versus a year ago some of the client activity volumes actually trended down so servicing fees it was worth about percentage point of servicing fee headwinds thats an example of a time it hits against us for full year it was actually a positive of almost percentage points so we saw that as a tailwind and obviously all the activity in first quarter or second quarter in particular was helpful next year were going to have to lap ourselves on that so it will probably be a headwind so its got that kind of effect and what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth right if theres an equity market tailwind or headwind that matters this client activity matters as well net new business right in particular i referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters and then theres always the normalized fee headwinds and the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and i wanted to also ask about the business that youre forming with microsoft ihs pimco and others can you give us some more detail on the structure there what products and services youll be contributing and how the potential offering there will compare to your standalone offering today state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah rob its early days youre referring to hub and its early days there in terms of whats going to happen and our view was that given the role that we play as a custodian as well as our own alpha product that this was a good initiative to hang around if you will we also have clients that are part of it but its just very early days in terms of how thats going to develop its initial focus is on data and data usage and helping firms kind of manage and employ data in a more efficient way but again its so early on theres really not much to report robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay no problem thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to eric aboaf for closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp its ron ill take it
