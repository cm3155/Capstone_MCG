the webcast and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year operating results and performance earlier this morning we reported diluted earnings per common share of for the three months ended december that is up compared to both the previous quarter and the yearago quarter and slightly ahead of consensus we are extremely pleased with the companys performance during the fourth quarter in many ways it was the strongest quarter of the year for us and marks a significant inflection point in terms of improved fundamentals we are encouraged by the strong rebound in loan growth during the quarter as well as the linkedquarter improvement in net interest income and net interest margin with the federal reserve lowering shortterm interest rates three times during the second half of last year the expected benefit to our net interest margin and the net interest income has started as both of those metrics improved during the current quarter turning now to our financial performance as i mentioned earlier our loan growth rebounded nicely during the fourth quarter as total loans increased billion compared to the third quarter of the year and rose billion or on a yearoveryear basis multifamily and specialty finance lending drove the loan growth during the year and the quarter multifamily loans increased million dollars or on a linkedquarter basis and billion or on a yearoveryear basis our specialty finance business had another strong quarter and an outstanding year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 as the portfolio increased million or on a yearoveryear basis origination activity also rebounded strongly during the fourth quarter of we originated billion of loans during the quarter thats up compared to the previous quarter and on a yearoveryear basis total originations were up multifamily originations totaled billion this quarter up compared to the prior quarter while cre originations of million increased this was the highest combined level of multifamilycre originations since the fourth quarter of we also originated almost million of specialty finance loans this quarter thats up compared to the previous quarter in addition to the strong origination activity during the fourth quarter we also opportunistically repurchased million of multifamily loans previously originated by us and sold to other financial institutions these loans were originally sold by us in order to stay below the sifi threshold overall this was one of the strongest quarters for loan growth in over two years and we continue to be encouraged by the potential loan growth in as the pipeline started the year off strongly currently it stands at billion of which is new money as a reminder the pipeline is at a point in time we typically originate more than what is in our pipeline as was the case this quarter on the funding side total deposits were relatively unchanged compared to the previous quarter and were up million or yearoveryear the yearoveryear growth was led in large part by cds which increased billion or in but declined modestly compared to the previous quarter our wholesale borrowings rose million on a linkedquarter basis and was primarily used to fund our loan growth during the fourth quarter as wholesale funding was a more attractive funding alternative during the past quarter on the revenue front we were very pleased to see top line revenue growth return this quarter net interest income increased million or annualized compared to the previous quarter as interest expense decline we also witnessed an improvement in the net interest margin during the fourth quarter as it rose basis points compared to the third quarter excluding the impact from prepayment fees the fourth quarter margin would have been up basis points and inline with expectations this was driven by a decline in our overall cost of funds and marks the first time since the fourth quarter of that both net interest income and the margin increased we expect both of these measures improving throughout given our liabilitysensitive balance sheet the feds current interest rate policies and the significant repricing opportunities embedded within our cd portfolio and wholesale borrowings moving on to operating expenses total noninterest expenses were million compared to million in the prior quarter and a million in the yearago quarter the efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was compared to during the previous quarter and during the yearago quarter over the past years we have reduced our operating expenses by approximately million and will continue to focus on cost containment going forward on the asset quality front our asset quality measures remained strong during the quarter and the year non performing assets totaled million or basis points of total assets while nonperforming loans were million or basis points of total loans new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 net chargeoffs remained at low levels totaling basis points of average loans for the year and only basis point of average loans during the fourth quarter the majority of our chargeoffs this year were related to taxi medallion loans that portfolio has been in runoff mode over the last two years and now stands at million importantly we have now been operating under the new regulation laws for six months and todate we are not seeing any negative asset quality trends in the rentregulated segment of our multifamily loan portfolio as noticed on page of todays investor presentation or billion of our total multifamily portfolio is subject to new york state rent regulation laws the weightedaverage ltv on this portion of the multifamily portfolio is about basis points less than the weightedaverage ltv on the entire multifamily portfolio lastly this morning we also announced that the board of directors declared a cash dividend per common share for the quarter the dividend will be payable on february to common shareholders of record as of february based on yesterdays closing price this represents an annualized dividend yield of on that note i would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions we will do our best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or this week thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will conduct a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities so i guess the first question just around loan growth only if i twopart to it one if i take out the million in purchase loan growth i guess on an organic basis still seemed a little soft so would love to hear just in terms of your loan growth outlook for the multifamily and the overall loan book for and i think the last time you updated on participation was in where you had about billion to billion in loans that had been participated so if you could remind us how much additional opportunity there is to repurchase some of those loans back joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc we really have about billion or more that we could do there but the thing is the market is strong and well have the ability to originate well within our appetite over the period ahead new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc ebrahim its tom i would add to joes commentary that obviously the focus here is to analyze be in the market were very effective in the market we see very strong economic spreads compared to the previous year since the rent laws have changed but more importantly when you take some of the oneoff transactions that we anticipate to go away in the fourth quarter versus q3 which is a very volatile quarter we saw our retention rate improve slightly which is a good signal our goal for is to go back to that predictable retention rate historically which would be much higher when you compare it to the past the second half of so when you think about that and you model it modeling a midsingledigit loan growth is very reasonable for our appetite in the market ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities got it midsingledigit loan growth and i guess tom on the core margins it went up basis points in line with your guidance how should we think about the margin going forward and just in terms of where the cd book is repricing relative to the million cost in the fourth quarter joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc right ebrahim as you know i dont go on a limb more than three months in the margin because obviously theyre very interesting environment but clearly we had the inflection point as we expected in the fourth quarter and we continue to see very strong visibility throughout the full year of with margin expansion every quarter as well as the growth in nii so nii inflected in q4 as expected up basis points in the fourth quarter i would say for the first quarter well have a higher nii expansion and probably another basis points in the margin and thats assuming no changes in interest rates and it excludes any prepayment penalty income ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities so joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so the continuation of margin expansion throughout were liabilitysensitive and we have a substantial amount as you indicated cds that will reprice to about billion and its throughout the entire year the lowest quarter of the repricing actually the second lowest quarter is the first quarter was million at a rate and q2 was about million at almost a rate so we really have a lot of repricing expectations going forward given where current interest rates are and if you look at where cds are coming on its just slightly south of i think the number was like in the fourth quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities so i guess just to be clear tom you expect the margin expansion of basis points is it safe to assume given what you said that that accelerates so we should see i know you dont want to give guidance beyond three months but all else equal should we see the basis points become basis points like and accelerate as progresses because thats kind of where street expectations are new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah again i feel really good that we have the inflection point im not going to give longdated guidance but i was very clear that i see margin expansion throughout the year but more importantly the nii growth is significant for us we havent seen that since the first second half first half of so the inflection point is here were liabilitysensitive we have a lot of liabilities were pricing so on the liability side we get good benefit in addition to the borrowings in cds we have borrowings which is material for us and borrowing rates compared to whats coming off is significantly attractive to us in and ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities got it ill requeue thanks a lot for taking my questions joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thank you operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning brock thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning guys okay so you covered the cd aspect on the wholesale borrowings i know you were pretty creative last year in using some of these hybrid fhlb structures the borrowing costs ticked down a bit this quarter what should we look for in the nearterm in terms of a relief on the borrowing cost thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc ill just be specific with the actual numbers we have billion that comes due within at a rate we put on a trade yesterday at about and that was about a billion and that was based on libor home loan bank floating libor and we swapped it out for three years with a swap which got a course to so were locked in there for three years with very little basis risk new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 so thats kind of what weve been doing recently so well continue doing that depending on market opportunities were not going to when you look at where our shortterm funding is its probably a basis points benefit to lock it up and swap it out after to years so well take advantage of that opportunity given the shape of the curve and when you go into you have another million at a rate so for the next two years we have some highcost money compared to the market that could be repriced lower brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and near term is there anything we should be aware of for q1 on that front thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i think its continuing i think its going to be an ongoing benefit each month we have its staggered throughout the quarter just like the cds i think in q2 for the cds well have a substantial benefit given its almost double the amount in q1 and its at the highest cost of the year so ph is the highest cost that we have rolling off on q2 for cds and that money is coming our indiscernible for right now is at at three months and nine months at and our 12month look with cd is at so if you tag on a few basis points to your elite customers its still well below so youre going to get a nice benefit on the cd front for the run rate next year brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay ill jump back in the queue thank you joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you operator our next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning ken thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning i guess tom you certainly laid out the case for a lot of opportunity for the liabilities to reprice lower but i guess weve heard this for a few quarters now and your core nim is only going up about basis points per quarter can you just walk us through the other side of the balance sheet i mean obviously with the fiveyear treasury like i mean is it just simply a matter that the loans are repricing a lot lower that offsets a lot of this liability benefit new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah ken let me be clear i didnt give any guidance other than past q1 on the margins so thats your expectation but no were very bullish about the fact that the fund cost is going to be low and our yields for the most part should be in a good position depending on where our interest rates go we really dont know where our rates are going to be at the end of the year but we have a sizable book of business thats coming during and the multifamily portfolio is about billion at a coming due in to billion at when you look at those rates compared to market rate weve seen a lot of volatility in rates weve been effectively pricing our multifamilycre business at a healthy spread compared to what it was a year ago so that basis point spread is real yes rates have come down but we still have a very good offering at them weve going to be very competitive i think the plan for is to focus on our intention we are going to be very focused on bumping that retention rate up to historical norms weve had a nice improvement when you take some of the oneoff deals from q3 versus q4 but q3 in we had lots of retention go away and a lot of that was because of well call it aggressive underwriting and aggressive agencies were going to be laserfocused to move that retention when you move the retention to a higher percentage for more normality for nycb youll see the loan growth kick in thats our goal for at the same time youll see where the market is on security we have a very small securities portfolio theres really not a whole lot of benefit right now to put capital and liquidity to work at this level so were being mindful of keeping it relatively flat until we see opportunities ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay so if i paraphrase that it sounds like youre going to get nim expansion but most of the nii growth is going to come from the balance sheet growth rather than the nim side right if i understand that thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah again depending where the interest rates are obviously if you would categorize ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc that more of the fourth quarter rates were dramatically higher right look where rates are today but they move around quite a bit and were very effective to get that basis points spread thats a much healthier spread we have seen and probably a good postcrisis because precrisis it was a basis point spread it went back to basis point then ultimately when the rent control laws have changed we believe the basis points is more than fair spread and were seeing some good activity there our lending people are very busy our focus is on making sure we have strong retention we have all the data we have all the loan files we know whats coming due and were going to work very hard to maintain our share at the same time we were very opportunistic in the previous quarter to take advantage of some other people that new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 are looking at divesting their position in multifamily including some of our partners on participation and well be active there as well ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay and then switching gears just a little bit in terms of expenses it looks like they were a little bit above your guidance from that you gave last quarter any reason for the increase this quarter and what do you think about expenses going into first quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so number one i would say i commend the entire team on the expense containment control weve had for two years its been a very difficult two years to keep those expenses down significantly so we had obviously a very strong expense number right we didnt want it within our guidance we probably beat for the most part throughout the year but for the most part we came id say slightly better than what management expected for the expense guide for as far as we believe that its going to be relatively stable i dont want to go on a limb yet but i think its fair to say that stabilization of our expenses are going to be key cost containment we have a few items that are going to increase our expenses slightly we have instituted a 401k match for the first time as a public company we have increased our minimum wage for our metro employees to an hour so were being competitive because it is a changing universe in the new york metro area as far as compensation cost and weve also released the salary freezes for offices so my guess is probably looking at maybe another million of expenses when you look at yearoveryear when you normalize the expense base for so although we printed a higher number when you normalize that youre looking from a to million another million as far as potential run rate for ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry million indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sorry about the longwinded answer by the way ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc no totally fine just make sure we got it right but the million includes that million increase thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think thats fair ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats fine new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc again were doing a lot on were going to grow this year again thats my anticipation but weve had a lot of cost containment initiatives over the past few years and were going to still be efficient our conversion yet has not completed we anticipate to have that by q2 thats probably dragging a little bit well get some benefit there in but i dont want to be too aggressive on the guide ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you very much thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question comes from steve moss with b riley please proceed with your question steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc good morning joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc one is on prepayments im just wondering what expectations are for the full year i missed how much you said tom that was coming due in terms of loan maturities this year thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so we have approximately billion of multifamily loans about that will be contractually maturing this year they have to come to the table at the same time in books about another billion at they have to come to the table in the next year in the next two years so we feel very optimistic that therell be elevated prepayment activity depending on the economic dollars depends on when they decide to prepay and refinance with us or away from us that being said we had a relatively strong q4 on prepay activity was strong q3 versus q4 i would say was a very healthy quarter origination stream was very strong as mr ficalora indicated a very strong origination new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 quarter we anticipate to have a very strong followthrough as we go through given the dynamics of the marketplace there are some interesting deals that hit the market and when you look at what buyers are looking at transactions the hurdle rate of returns are higher but theyre getting it done so theres been that zero activity starting to move slowly towards buyers and sellers yes its a q4 activity always happens on q4 but we see deals being done which is interesting because the hurdle rate of returns are reasonable and these are tied to multifamily rentregulated buildings being transacted at levels that are reasonable tax rates are very reasonable theyre not elevated so id say the reaction to the rent controls changes that hurdle rate of returns for longterm property owners are higher theyre getting some transactions done and we believe that will continue as we move further away from the enactment of the new change of the law steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay thats helpful and then tom i think you also said that the second quarter cd bucket is the largest just wondering how large that bucket it is in repricing thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc q2 is about billion compound at coming due steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay and then just in terms of new money yields here just wondering where youre seeing spreads for multi family and cre these days thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah weve been holding solid at basis point probably another ph an eighth to quarter above that for cre were going to adjust to be competitive but weve done a fine job since june on making our presence known that we need to get paid a higher premium compared to historical premiums of about basis point spread on the treasury so its still hovering around giveortake ph an eighth here and there but its been very healthy steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc all right thank you very much thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ill start first on the million of loan repurchases in the quarter i assume that was done at par correct thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc im not going to be specific on the price but obviously if this tapers theres probably two years left so its our loan its underwrite on our standards we control the transaction were going to be very proactive so i would say approximately at that level but giveandtake im not going to be specific on the actual dollar number but well its opportunistic we think that theres a few more out there and were here to accommodate these are the loans that weve originated we have all the files the data and we will be proactive in the event the other partners are looking to move away out of this line of business andor decide to be more focused on ci so we steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc please bear in mind steven when we put this in place we were in a sifi threshold criteria that we could not grow the bank steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so we had billions of dollars that had to go to the marketplace and our partners our friends out in the marketplace are very accommodative because of our asset quality metrics so were very pleased to be able to offer that in our balance sheet to get it back new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc high probability we will refinance most of these loans thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah and i think whats important about that the way the transaction is originally structured a lot of this retention that weve done weve originated it if someone has a lets say pari passu at we have the we only keep so as we take this out we have more potential for growth that was part of an ongoing thing over the past few years weve had many players that gets refilled on refinancing that were actually getting the lesser of the deal because of the transaction that we struck with them on the original sale steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right but what would be the yield of million thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc its probably about just under million steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc million okay and are you implying thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc like i said its got two years lifeless its not two years average life two years life less steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so thats that and origination bucket that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 theyre all going to go unless you dont have it and by the way we dont have to replace that with pari passu terms now we decide what to do when we refinance steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right and then the billion thats remaining which you could repurchase could you repurchase all that tomorrow if you wanted to or there are time restrictions or other restrictions on that thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc theres no time restrictions i mean look it is what it is if someone was willing to we would love to have the opportunity to our loans back because we believe in our credit metrics those loans were done at a very opportunistic time and its still wellunderwritten and below ltv so clearly im not going to even go there as far as the number from timetotime well be there for the market i dont want to give you false expectations the best part of the market indiscernible so were more than willing to accommodate steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc but if the yields are not bad and the credit quality is good why are your partners looking to divest these thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc oh theres a number of reasons i mean obviously you see many public statements made by a lot of the competitors to diversify their balance sheet in ci theyre doing other things with their business model we are a multifamilycre lender this is our business model we focus in the rentregulated and rentcontrolled marketplace thats what we do we do not were not going to try and say were commercial bank doing ci lending this is our core business model so we will be there for our customers like i said initially from when the rent laws were changed at higher spreads joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc we are far more comfortable with these assets than people that have never originated these assets so for us the future period is not an unusual concern this is going to work out very well for us steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah and as you guys are seeing new appraisals on multifamily loans how much valuation is contracted post new rent regulation all the way of six months thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes so i would comment there hasnt been a lot of deals that have been done but youve probably read this the same publication that weve all reviewed a lot of the information is not correct because they dont take the full picture of the transaction as most of the deals have a commercial use component to the total rent roll as well as new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 the rent control aspect but the cap rates that have come in are not near what the fear was when the rent laws were put in place so were still seeing low to mid versus high in certain markets like i said you have to look at each market each street each area differently each borough bronx versus manhattan certain pockets of manhattan versus other pockets of manhattan the diversity of the income stream so cap rates have held in very well you can if you want to do some statistical analysis maybe a quarter with to basis points moving in the cap rate which is not near what the fear was initially some of the publications that put these numbers that made no sense down its not reality theyve literally carved out the commercial use space of the income stream when you add that back its not a unreasonable decline on value adjustment because of the really theyre driven off the hurdle rate of return this is not when you think about the business model some of them put their capital up and theyll be financing behind it if they can get highsingle digit its attractive if youre a longterm property owner and you have thousands of units that you manage and youre willing to put your money up at a highsingledigit return that return when it was at its peak was zero because they were improving units constantly so the fact that you became highsingle digits there is a market for that when you put io features into it it comes out to the mid teens so i mean on amortization youre probably looking at highsingle with io its midteens joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc but its really important to recognize the change that has occurred has impacted future values we never lend on future values we lend on existing values so our portfolio has not had any adverse effect of the change and our prospective opportunity is going to be based upon whatever the numbers may be when in fact were projecting the value of the asset that is going to be consistent with our past practice weve never used the future value and therefore the trade in the real estate months from now months from now is not going to impact one iota our ability to lend because we lend on the existing values that are in the portfolio that actually do exist in that particular building there is no concern that we have that our assets are going to start nonperforming because we overlend many many many many people in the market and everybody knows this if youre lending more dollars than were lending youre lending on a value other than the existing cash flow we only lend on the existing cash flow so even though this change has occurred and the prospective value will be less it doesnt threaten our ability to be repaid thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and steve and i will just add one additional commentary that its very encouraging to see large transactions hit the marketplace and being financed some of them were financing others are financing it but the reality is there are people stepping up looking at the longterm and getting a reasonable rate of return on their money and willing to be in this business and a lot of the nuances between how they manage these units now are going to be somewhat different theyre looking for loopholes based on the rent rate changes in particular theyll leave units vacant and try to join the unit next door thats something that some of the wealthier players can do because they have capacity and they have network to do so so i think youre seeing a lot of that and theres probably less units hitting the marketplace than ever before because of these changes which unfortunately will be negative for the city but these large players will continue to transact new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah and joe if i could change directions just ask you one final question so we saw another moe announced earlier in the week and youve talked about wanting to do a deal for a while now do you feel any sense of urgency to try to and get something announced and done before the ph releaseapproved before the presidential election joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc no i dont feel any urgency to do that but i would suggest that we are at actively in discussions in the marketplace with a variety of people to accomplish the goals that we have articulated over the course of our entire public life weve made it very clear that we have the ability and have the desire to grow by acquisition and create value for shareholders so there is going to be a transaction on the horizon that will be exactly inline with the kinds of things that weve done in the past so i would openly suggest to you that we are in active discussions to do transactions because thats what we do steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough thanks for taking all my questions thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question comes from peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning pete joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning pete peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hey i was just curious last quarter you talked about the efficiency ratio for in the low im just wondering if youre still comfortable with that range new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well i kind of i hate to go on a limb not go specifically but i gave you the expense guide up million based on normalized million obviously prepay does play a factor so im not giving you any guidance on prepaid but we should have a relatively healthy prepayment world in given the duration of the portfolio at the same time i think that we have the nii going up every quarter so we should see improvements on the overall efficiency ratio our goal would be to bring it in the low but hopefully midtolow is kind of our target its going to take a few positive changes in the marketplace to make that happen but its not unreasonable given the fact that were in a cost containment mode for so many years and now were growing the balance sheet and our nii is now moving in the right direction we had a compressed nii for many many years so this inflection point should bode well for the other attribute of the calculation on the efficiency ratio so this should help us improve the ratio peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and i was just looking at securities to assets thats been in a pretty consistent range last couple of quarters at im just wondering if youre thinking about growing the securities portfolio because i think youd like to get it at some point to the highteens if im not mistaken thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i think its fair to say that pete but at the end of the day you look where the spreads are right now weve had a lot of debentures paid off over the past to months cash flows are flying into the bank as far as structured mortgage paper so we were a very large ph debt player and that stuff has been very nice as far as the overall yields to the bank but at the end of the day the yields have come down materially so were going to allocate our resources to the loan book in the event the market changes and we start seeing a slope indiscernible highest slope in the curve well get to that level its going to take some time in this market because given where the interest rates are but if we go back to a healthier curve well be more proactive peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and then my last question just can you talk about what your expectations are for deposit growth in and how you think about the balance between deposit growth and the use of wholesale borrowings thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i mean were going to be obviously in the market for deposits the goal is to commensurate with asset growth if you look back for the full year we grew deposits almost as consistent with our asset growth we had a little bit more wholesale towards the end of the fourth quarter because of the fact that we shifted a lot of the higher cost relationships out of the bank in q3 but when you look at overall absolute deposit growth we had a good year deposit growth in thats the plan for is commensurate with asset growth and well readjust depending on market conditions new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 if the fed cuts substantially we may alter that but right now shortterm money is expensive compared to if you look at the belly of the curve been pushing it out a few years like i said previously we locked in solid funding at the low lets say and versus shortterm rates that are out there at high so its attractive both sides are attractive given that were liabilitysensitive but the more attractive aspect is the refinancing of our current liabilities peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc right got it thanks tom thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question comes from christopher marinac with fig partners please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning tom and joe the success youve had on the specialty finance the past year and the pipeline looks really strong could you remind us the differences in yield on that portfolio and then the types of things that you do and also types of things that you avoid in specialty finance thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so as weve talked about it our team has done a phenomenal job and were very pleased of their production we believe theyre going to have another strong and we support that the team members have done and an incredible job focusing on asset quality no late pays no delinquencies no defaults no real credit hiccups to speak of and very welldiverse book the book is broken out between three categories assetbacked loans equipment financing and dealer floorplanning assetbacked is around million outstanding with percentage of total outstandings compared to the total dollar amount of billion equipment is about billion thats of the total and deal floorplanning which has been very attractive in this environment at million which is the yield on the papers is slightly higher than our multifamily yield when you take in the account fees and that we amortize to the yield its about were going to be active i think whats most important is that what we see is we turn down most of what we see so were effectively doing about a hit rate on of what we see so is what we dont do not because its credit it could be yield it could be various reasons our board may not be happy with the various counterparties but at the end of the day we typically have been turning down of what we see weve growing the book around on a cagr basis new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 so were very pleased to allocate capital there like ive said in many previous conference calls it doesnt come with the positive relationships were not intrusive to the lead bank but were a credit buyup shop and so were going to be very well be a good partner for some of the largest players but were not booking into the positive relationship thats the down thats one of the negative aspects of the business were not bringing in the funding for this type of business christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thats really helpful thanks for going through that and then speaking of deposits it seemed that the core deposits excds had a solid quarter and was stronger than the total what do you see for this year i know its still a challenging environment but whats sort of in your deposit pipeline thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no we think that its going to be continuing similar to the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter rates go dramatically lower than they were a year ago when the fed was in a tightening mode right so our highest offering rate is in the threemonth category well bring the highest cost money into the shortend of the curve so three months at and i think customers are looking at that as a viable alternative in going out to a year or longer given where rates are our oneyear offering on a liquid cd is about so were clearly enticing customers to go into the shorter duration our ninemonth money is at youve seen that yeah so customers are keeping inside of one year it has been consistent for the past decade and we think that if the fed happens to reduce rates well benefit further in the meantime if the fed stays flat for the year there should be very wellplanned for to take advantage of those higher costs cds coming throughout the year which ive mentioned in the previous commentary christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great that was good thank you tom appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning everybody new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i was hoping you could talk about cecl what the day ph trip reserve reserve would look like and then on a goforward basis could you help us understand what the types of growth youre talking about if we should expect that reserve to increase or decrease or just any sort of commentary on day as well would be helpful thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well i would say with respect to the onetime adjustment were looking at probably to increase in our overall reserve which is about million to million joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc yes to thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc its to joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc right thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc again we dont envision it as having a material impact to our company given that were a real estate lender and our duration is very very short compared to other types of loans if you look at our average life at years for the book its very short albeit macroeconomic changes to the environment its hard to predict what could happen two three years from now but we are a multifamily lender that has a relatively short duration book and should not have a material impact going forward the capital is probably between to basis points upfront and not material matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then sticking with the capital question over the last year yearandahalf weve seen capital is measured by tangible common equity grind slowly lower given the kind of growth outlook youre talking about the nim expansion how comfortable are you with taking capital levels potentially lower and do you see any need to adjust the dividend or potentially down the road raise any sort of common equity new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc im not even going to go to the dividend question at this stage of the game weve been doing this for quite some time obviously commensurate with the nii growth margin expansion also comes the eps growth so like i said in the previous quarters its inconceivable to say we should have doubledigit eps growth which is reasonable and thats conservative so i think that were in a positive indiscernible in respect to build some capital for the first time in a while as our earnings improve with this dynamic of the margin and the nii expanding so i think were encouraged by that were very comfortable with our capital position we have no losses we have a history of no losses we have a history of having the best asset quality in the country so as far as you want to allocate capital to a business that has zero losses we have very little allocation towards the impact of provisioning for highquality lowleverage lending so were very comfortable about capital position our dividend is solid and weve always been standing by our dividend and thats been the hallmark of the company matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then going back to your midsingle digit loan growth comment the pipeline is down quarterover quarter just want to get a sense for how much of the growth you anticipate being from organic versus repurchase activity if you could give us a breakdown thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah i wont even budget repurchase activity id go organic we are laserfocused to increase our retention rate which we will do in and more importantly if you look at the we had billion business in the fourth quarter q1 is down on seasonality its a seasonality quarter so were very excited about whats ahead of us our guys are extremely busy the pipeline that we announced is the committed pipeline the pipeline that we have is much higher because the loans are coming in and were laserfocused on managing that retention rate managing that billion billion of business coming due in the next two years we have the files we have the data we will make sure that we get first crack at our customers matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood and then just last one for me is we get to see the press releases we dont see behind the scenes whats going on with ltvs and reappraisals like you do on the multifamily side and so i was hoping you could just walk us through where there have been reappraisals where there have been valuations that have come in lower have you seen any ltvs that have tripped over if they do what is borrower behavior are people willing and actively bringing cash to the table to maintain low ltvs just some sense and comfort around borrower behaviors in light of lower valuations thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so im not going to sound cavalier about this but at the end of the day were a lowleverage lender we dont see these types of numbers that theyre concerned about at todays environment with two quarters past the rent control laws that would be in effect its going to take some time to see what these impacts are in other parts of the borrowers new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 but at the end of the day if youre a lowleverage lender and buyers and sellers are coming together and then putting a hurdle rate of return that people can agree with therell be transactions well finance it based on a very conservative policy and we lose loans were losing because other banks are being aggressive we play against the government we play against a lot of large banks but we are very targeted towards superconservative underwriting so what were seeing right now and youll see a lot of information in the current trade publications about deals that get done were not doing all those deals because it doesnt make sense for our balance sheet but you may have to extend a little bit longer in this environment because property owners may want an extra couple of years so the 5year may go to maybe some 10year money you may try to tweak some io structure from a no io to maybe a 3year io but youll be competitive but it all comes down to that were not going to lose deals because of rate we will lose deals because of dollar amount and thats always been the hallmark of the company so when times are difficult therell be activity buyers will come in and buy opportunity then well finance that opportunity so were not there yet the good news is that some of the nontraditional players that are equity financiers or bridge financiers are getting diluted on their deal its because theyre not working but thats not our book so thats positive because youre not seeing the losses yet theres a handful of customers that are in a not all customers a handful of customers that are in the fannie mae structure or the freddie mac structure that are coming through with some difficulties and when it goes to the special servicer gets put out to sale someone will buy that at a hurdle rate of return that works for them and if the numbers works for us well finance it matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc and im just probably missing one of the points cap rates are not moving aggressively cap rates are holding very nicely interest rates are relatively low compared to last year so you still have a very low cap rate and you have a low interest rate environment so business is relatively strong because of that matthew breese q analyst stephens inc thats all i had thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc ph very well operator our next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc so just getting back to the competitive environment can you give us some color to what youre seeing today versus what you saw last quarter in terms of the gses and other nonbanks and what are the factors driving those differences thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well i would say its tom i would say that the gse is very real theyre very large and it could be always a welcome player and the best players will be very active and io is a very attractive alternative for customers who want to bring their payments lower and try to drive higher returns to them in potentially over a 10year period weve been very proactive on trying to avoid that type of model when we structure io we tend to be a hybrid io player in maybe one two threeyear type of io but if you have a solid lowleverage transaction with a very good longterm customer you may have to play in that landscape well the best scenario for us as rates go up in the back end the agencies are less relevant so right now theyre relevant but well compete and id say that the government has the biggest acts for the transactions in the marketplace and at the same time like i said were going to be very active on managing that book thats coming due and making sure that we get first crack at all of our customers steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc appreciate that and then just last question youre noninterest bearing deposits had a nice uptick in the quarter can you just give some color on that thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i would say this again seasonality indiscernible at yearend i wouldnt think its not a targeted plan this is were running a very large deposit but we do have some seasonality there steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate it thank you guys thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 operator our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc collyn how are you joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good good morning gentlemen i didnt think i was going to get on here okay thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just first on the funding side so tom i appreciate some of the rates youre offering that youre putting out there on the cd market now it seems like some of those cd rates are probably below market or sort of at market i mean you still have confidence in your ability to grow the deposit book even if youre below market rates on cds thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc were a large institution we have a lot of branches in different markets like i said we do offer a hybrid elite customer base maybe a few basis points of customers who are going to analyze us for or basis points to retain it but at the end of the day weve been very competitive there were not in a massive growth campaign right now if we are going to go to a growth campaign if the market does change and the becomes growth on the loan side then well go into a growth campaign mode but to be in the market were like you said in the middle of the range and i think slightly south of on average is where the overall market is and i think by the way the market is too high if you look at where treasuries are trading right now i think a lot of liquidity was put in place yearend because of the balance sheet requirements some of the larger money center banks were pushing their balance sheet requirements but even if you think about where the rates are right now and rates have come down quite a bit were at for nine months its a reasonable rate probably too high and if the fed cuts rates will lower but in the meantime our model has no fed changes we assume the fed is on hold for the year and were in a unique spot to benefit from a liabilitysensitive balance sheet and see some good noi growth from that collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 okay joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc we can adjust that very quickly collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then just so tom you had indicated deposit growth commensurate with loan growth how about if you do see more opportunistic loan purchases how do you intend to fund those thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc we will look at both the wholesale markets as well as the deposit markets collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc like i said before the wholesale markets if structured properly is very attractive right now there is somewhat of a uniqueness in the return and when we look at the belly of the curve and the shortend of the curve shortterm financing is expensive compared to doing a three or fouryear lockout with putting a swap on so weve been doing that from time to time the basis risk is low we think its a reasonable execution and weve been very proactive there both from time to time depending on the marketplace but were putting money on right now versus on cds so theres definitely a reasonable delta to move towards wholesale collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful and just also to your point right so retention is going to be so key to sort of the loan growth outlook just a couple of questions on that so you had indicated and i think this is the first time you guys put it in the press release that the pipeline had new money this quarter do you have what that percentage was from last quarters pipeline thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so i would say and i think weve always put it in maybe look back i remember various press release we always kind of tell the overall new money pipeline new money has been around twothirds its been pretty consistent i think whats interesting is that you know when you have certain deals that are going to go for good reason we have some customers that finance themselves rather than going to the bank because of mortgage transfer tax they didnt have to deal with the expense of doing a transaction in new york so they used their credit facility which was cheaper than getting money from the bank that happens from time to time so we take advantage of those oneoffs and try to carve out what happened in the quarter i think our retention has improved slightly but we have a long way to go i like to have that retention rate going back towards the new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 normality which was significantly higher than we were in the previous six months so you saw a dropoff when the rent control laws were put in place we had a lot of volatility in q3 q4 we had good stabilization the healthy yield curve in q4 very attractive buying and selling it wasnt a blockbuster quarter as far as transaction but there were some transactions and things are getting done so i like the fact that theres a predictable fed right now more or less for the year and i think that customers are realizing that a lot of money has to be dealt with in the next two years so they have to finance and with that were open for business collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then so just kind of along the lines of the billion of originations net growth putting the purchase aside was million so just trying to sort of i mean obviously better understand bridging that gap and i think when you talk about the outlook for prepays and not dynamic in i guess im if theyre contractually maturing if the numbers youve laid out are contractually maturing this year why would they prepay i wouldnt think they would prepay right so wouldnt prepay income be significantly less thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well like i said depending on what bucket comes due its very important we know that in if they wait the last second theyre not going to pay on their financing right theyll pay the market lets say the market is so you have a going to still good for the bank yes you dont get a prepayment because theyre rolling it to the next financing but those loans have no choice but to come due the ones that are in is where the opportunity will arise if they decide to lockin for the next seven years instead of five they may choose to do so based on their own internal decisions based on financing their entire portfolio of loans were going to be very active on working with our customers to get into the table sooner we do that all the time but in this particular case our goal is to maintain higher retention so we know whats coming due we know whats coming due for the next five years but for the next two years theres an opportunity to take those lower yielding loans and not put them in a position to go to a much higher rate because no one knows where rates are going to be a year from now they may opt to finance today and so we could be proactive with the portfolio collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay one last question indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay sorry one last question the retention rate can you tell us what that was this quarter and where how that compares to what youve been running previously or what your goal is new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so the reality is that our goal is to get back to historical levels which is well above okay were not there yet q3 was probably the worst youve seen we bumped it up by when you carve out certain loans that we knew were going andor were not willing to finance i mentioned one in particular because it was a large loan of million that used their credit facility to finance themselves and you take those oneoffs we probably improved our retention rate by so becomes we need to be well over and moving towards in thats the goal collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful ill leave it there thank you very much thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure thank you operator we have a followup question from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hi thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc hey brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for hey i know you talked about the day cecl impact weve heard a lot of banks kind of walking up net chargeoffs guides for a variety of reasons how should we think about as far as net chargeoffs is this still a 5basis point kind of a number or should we be thinking something more given the shift into specialty finance or what have you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no brock so brock what i would say is if you carveout the medallion zero is probably a number for us its really the history you know the history of the company our credit quality medallion has been most of the charges weve taken over the past few years the good news there is there are some major players circling to look at acquiring most of those assets in the marketplace so it sounds like were getting close to the bottom there you can never predict where the bottom is when you take out medallion losses we dont have any losses as far specialty finance its been a we havent seen a 30day ever so i think were in a very good spot i wouldnt work too hard in understanding our difference between a credit card lending because this is what we do new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29jan2020 were a rentregulated multifamilycre lender with a history of no losses i think our cre book is half the losses weve had in multifamily which is de minimis so yes the accounting laws do change were going to take a fund change in the provision because we have to to rightsize the onetime adjustment the capital impact of that is between to basis points but after that its business as usual and unless theres a change in the marketplace and the duration goes from years to years i dont envision any real material changes for us joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and then by the way medallions are down dramatically brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats not part of our business that is something we had actually negotiated to sell and weve been getting out of that consistently over the period past brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you
