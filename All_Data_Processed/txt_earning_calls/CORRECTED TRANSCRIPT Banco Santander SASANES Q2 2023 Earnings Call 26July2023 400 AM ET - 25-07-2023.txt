greater detail and then ill conclude with a few closing remarks despite the challenges the financial system experienced at the beginning of the year q2 was another strong quarter for santander demonstrating the strength and resilience of our strategy and unique business model even in times of market volatility we delivered record profit of billion an increase of compared with q2 in thats plus in constant euros in the first half of profit was billion up supported by robust customer revenue growth revenue increased double digits yearonyear supported by all regions and global businesses global and network businesses are contributing around of total group revenue our numbers of customers grew by million yearonyear taking the total to million and loans increased by and deposits by the group continues progressing towards a simpler and more integrated model through one transformation the program that is accelerating our structural model change to drive efficiency improvement and growth in profitability as a result our efficiency ratio improved percentage points yearonyear to and our net operating income grew double digits on return on tangible equity guarantee rote rose basis points yearonyear to while our earnings per shares improved yearonyear supported by greater profit and share buybacks at the same time our strong balance sheet with solid and sound capital ratio liquidity at comfortable levels and robust credit quality contributed to solid profitable growth value creation and shareholder remuneration these results allow us to deliver value creation in terms of tnav plus eps yearonyear of of which represents an increase of more than billion in the first six months of the year moving on to the income statement firstly remember that as we usually do we are presenting growth rates both in current euros and constant euros this quarter there was no material difference between them as i have just banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 mentioned profit increase in the first half supported by first of all a strong line performance with all the regions and global businesses growing cost in line with our expectations growing point below the rate of inflation doubledigit growth in net operating income to approximately billion which demonstrates the strength of our results and low loss provisions normalizing in line with our expectations these trends resulted in our highest quarterly profit on record higher than in q1 even after the following impacts net of taxes recorded in q2 the srf contribution of more than million and additional swiss mortgage provisions in poland of million and oneoffs in brazil of million josé will go into more detail on all of these points later on this was a great first half that makes us confident that we will deliver on our targets good business dynamics are translating into doubledigit revenue growth our efficiency ratio improved as a result of good cost control and revenue trends our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below at yearend cet1 was after profitably growing our businesses organically and at comfortable levels allowing us to accrue the funds to meet our shareholders remuneration targets of a payout our rote also grew yearonyear to on track to reach our target and would already be close to if we dont annualize extraordinary banking tax on revenue earned in spain as we announced at our investor day we have entered into a new phase of value creation that will help us grow tnav per share plus eps at double digits during the or through the cycle id like to spend a couple of minutes updating you on the progress of our transformation plan now that we are six months down the road from our investor day we are transforming the bank in the right way because we are structurally changing our model to improve both cost and revenue we are making great progress in the implementation of one transformation creating a common operating model and technology for our retail business across our entire footprint to better serve our customers and to improve efficiency and to increase the size and profitability of our customer base we are delivering across the three pillars of one transformation in simplification we already have reduced our number of products nearly fewer products in we are progressing in our digital selfservice model increasing the availability of products and services in our digital channels and reducing the use of our contact center by just alone in the first quarter of compared with the same period last year we are digitalizing the onboarding process endtoend in mexico this initial pilot has resulted in a growth in digital accounts per month compared to those in and we have already captured around million in savings so far in the us from transformation and simplification initiatives as you can see on the slide the initial efficiencies for one transformation and the impact of our ph good spread management in a context of higher rates higher interest rates which our cfo will cover later in depth have already contributed basis points in efficiency improvements our global and network business continue contributing to the groups profitability and have already delivered another basis points multilatinas and multieuropeans our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and smes through regional coverage model are growing at a very high rates with revenue increasing by more than yeartodate in asset management we have progressed to enter the alternative business its starting to serve open market and institution segment and has reached more than billion commitments already in payments we have deployed getnet in portugal and argentina in the first half and we expect to launching latest in chile in the second half in auto we are increasing managing oems and retail relationships globally expanding our partnerships in europe to latam and the us we have recently onboarded new partners in the usa in the us leverage the existing agreements in europe which are expected to materialize in around billion of new business per year we have also deployed a new panregional leasing platform in two markets and more countries will be added throughout and finally our global technology capabilities have already resulted in basis points banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 improvement in the efficiency ratio our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture million in savings this year mainly driven by one efficiencies from the recent development and deployment of gravity in two countries which has contributed to with million in savings in the first half and new global agreements with vendors which represent around million in cost reduction yeartodate the actions that we are beginning to carry out as a part of one transformation which we are expanding across the group are starting to be reflected on cost and on operational efficiencies as you can see on the slide simplification has already driven significant improvements in our cost and revenue per active customer ratios the solid progress we are making with the process digitalization and automation to capture efficiencies enables us to spend less time on operations in branches and turn the branch network into a powerful sales and advisory channel portugal has already taken out most of the operational activities from the branches freeing up branch employees so that they can spend more time supporting customers and commercial activities were extrapolating this to other of our ranks in only six months through one transformation we have already reduce the number of operational ftes per million customers by we are already deploying global tech platforms to improve customer experience leverage economies of scale and extend best practices open digital services as we call it ods our cutting edge frontend platform allow us to deliver a bestinclass omnichannel experience to our customers at the same time the gravity our awardwinning core banking platform drives significant efficiencies versus mainframe technology we have integrated both in the us so we will operate it on an endtoend cloudbased retail technology stack core and omnichannel which is already tested and will result in significant improvements in service quality and customer experience our global and network businesses continue to contribute to this new phase of value creation in cib we continue growing the strongly after record performance in beating the market our global presence has allowed us to grow at yearonyear well above the average of annual growth target of for the period because first of all we can provide a onestopshop service to our clients across all geographies thereby capturing crossborder flows and because we bring cib products and services to our wealth retail and commercial clients across the group and vice versa as a result revenue related to these two concepts which we call network revenue grew yearonyear to billion wealth management and insurance grew year onyear well above our target and this has been boosted by the financial benefits obtained from the santander network effect a fundamental part of our value proposition in private banking is our unique combination of local presence and local reach and global reach our customers can move and transact easily from one country to another and thats the reason why customers have billion in assets under management booked abroad higher than one year ago our payments business is also growing very strongly two years ago we began to move our payments business on to scaled global platforms and as of today our payments hub platform already manages a significant part of all payments in the eurozone and we are progressing in another key countries such as brazil mexico and the uk we are in the process of expanding our cards platform across the group delivering realtime digital processing capabilities to our banks accelerating our business growth as well as generating operational synergies of around million per year during the next two years alone first delivery of the platform will be live in brazil by the second half of in auto we continue to prioritize profitability over market share growth in a context of rising interest rates banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 our transformation plan which is making us more much more efficient and increasing contribution of our global and network businesses is helping us reach our profitability targets across all regions and businesses as i mentioned earlier the groups rote rose basis points yearonyear to and would be around if we ph didnt annualize the extraordinary banking tax in spain which is in line with the groups targets for sorry and josé will now go in more detail to the groups first half performance please josé josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you héctor and good morning everyone audio gap tailwinds and latin america driven by growth in volumes and fees digital consumer bank benefited from asset repricing actions and gains on financial transactions due to fx hedges we also saw a strong performance across businesses the only exception was auto the result of lower leasing income in the us which as in previous quarters was affected by an increase in the share of endoflease vehicles repurchased at the dealership revenue at the corporate centre also improved up nearly million due to higher liquidity buffer remuneration and a lower impact from fx hedging which negatively affected revenue last year most of our revenue growth came from nii which continued its upward trend increasing in the quarter alone driven in particular by europe we see upside potential for further growth in the coming quarters first half was higher yearonyear in constant euros with positive sensitivity to raising rates mainly in europe and mexico and volume growth in auto north america and south america which more than offset negative interest rate sensitivity in brazil chile on auto in terms of profitability we have improved our margins every quarter since the first quarter of well continue to actively manage our credit spreads to make the most of the higher interest rate environment gains from credit yields outweighed higher funding costs thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration strategy adapted to each countrys specific needs in europe we are strictly managing deposit costs especially in spain and portugal where there is excess liquidity in the system and much lower credit demand the uk has a more competitive environment in line with our expectations in latam deposit rates are more directly linked to market interest rates which implies negative sensitivity and will benefit margins when rates start to decline over the next few months finally in the us deposit betas are higher due to the heightened competition following the collapse of silicon valley bank all in all net interest income sensitivity to interest rates has resulted on million above the assumptions that we shared during our investor day therefore we are well on track to meet our doubledigit nii growth guidance for turning now to fees in an environment of low fee growth in general as a result of subpar loan demand weaker activity consumer activity and higher margins our net fee income grew at in the quarter compared with the same quarter last year and in the first half yearonyear cib and pagonxt are leading the way in terms of growth cib is increasing its share of leading roles and mandates and pagonxt continued to expand total payment volumes which rose yearonyear and banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 transactions we also had a very good performance for cards with turnover increasing yearonyear with fees growing retail banking also continued to grow well primarily driven by an increase in customers and transactionality wealth management and insurance grew less as customers moved to lowerrisk fixed income products with lower fees and margins however we saw volume improvements in both private banking net new money of billion and santander asset management over billion net sales auto performance yearonyear was affected by the new insurance regulation in germany in the first quarter but recovered significantly in the second quarter in terms of costs our transformation efforts that héctor took you through earlier are paying off despite initial investments cost in real terms are growing below the rate of inflation across most of our footprint reflecting the savings we are beginning to generate on our strict cost control this in turn is reflected in efficiency improvements led by europe which improved percentage points thanks to strong revenue gains together with a fall in costs in real terms as a result group efficiencies were really at the bottom end of our target range where we expect it to remain for the rest of the year credit quality remains robust across our footprint the nonperforming loan ratio remained stable in the context of an expected soft landing and strong labor markets as unemployment is a key driver of credit quality of note with the positive trends in brazil driven by the more selective lending policies that we introduced a year and a half ago we said in the fourth quarter of last year that we believe the brazil npl ratio had already peaked and trends so far this this year support that view having improved almost basis points yeartodate in terms of cost of risk we remain comfortably on track to meet our target to remain below spain continues to perform well with a 12month cost of risk down basis points yearonyear supported by the quality of the loan book and improving macro conditions normalization in the us continues but is more resilient than anticipated brazil remains elevated due to the unsecured individual borrowers portfolio but we are seeing signs that cost of risk has stabilized brazils 12month cost of risk at the end of june was but if we annualize the first six months that improved to mexico is increasing from low levels mainly due to a changing mix towards unsecured loans which require more provisions upfront and obviously more is more profitable other units such as the uk portugal and the digital consumer bank are rising but from a very low base and should remain below all in line with throughthecycle averages moving on to our balance sheet structure as we have discussed in previous presentations our credit portfolio is well diversified by segment product and country moreover our balance sheet is low risk the portfolio is highly secured with quality collateral and has low average loantovalues loan growth yearonyear was flat in constant euros as growth in auto and consumer was offset by falls in cib mainly in spain from very high levels in mortgages driven by early repayments in europe and slowing demand from corporates also in europe we saw positive dynamics in north america south america and dcb on the other hand deposits continued to grow well up year on year following a billion increase in the second quarter in constant euros reflecting new customer capture which more than offset mortgage prepayments we saw growth across the bank concentrated mainly in time deposits as customers seek higher rates our deposit base is diversified and highly stable using lcr criteria of our deposits are transactional which are stickier and a high proportion for deposits from individuals are covered by deposit guarantee schemes we have not seen any unusual movements in deposits in the yeartodate following market turmoil particularly in the us in fact deposits in the us grew in the quarter remained flattish yeartodate which implies that we are banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 gaining market share in deposits and with an average cost which was well below our main competitors mutual funds have begun to recover up yearonyear following a year of instability in to close let me cover capital our fully loaded capital ratio remained at a comfortable level of backed by a strong organic capital generation which was again basis points net of dividend accrual in the quarter we accounted for the buyout of the minority shareholders in mexico which costs basis points in terms of capital we also had a series of other small positives and negatives this quarter that almost offset each other we continued to focus on profitable growth opportunities which is reflected in a front book rorwa of up from in the first half of which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity in excess of so in excess of the current group return on tangible equity which will support profitability going forward additionally we continued to increase balance sheet mobilization and the percentage of riskweighted assets with positive economic valueadded progressing well towards our investor day target of in this increased profitability will help us continue to build capital over the next few years and we are confident our capital ratio will remain above even after taking into account the final implementation of basel iii on january let me turn it back to héctor for his concluding remarks thank you hector blas grisi checa chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you josé in summary q2 of was another strong quarter supported by customer growth doubledigit revenue increase and also backed by strong performance by all the regions and businesses we are accelerating the structural change to a simpler and more integrated model through one transformation is spreading the initiative all across the group which is driving efficiency improvement and also profitable growth a rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth value creation and shareholder remuneration in summary we have a very strong first half of the year and we are confident that we will achieve our targets and remunerate our shareholders in line with our payout policy supported by our global and network businesses while we continue with our structural model transformation we see upside potential for further net interest income growth in the coming quarters as tailwinds in europe and mexico are expected to remain and inflation and interest rates in our largest latin american market latin american countries seem to have peaked or nearly peaked resulting in a positive outlook for margins in the next six to nine months cost of risk is normalizing in line with our expectation in a context of an expected soft landing of the economy and strong labor markets we continue to see resilient customer and corporate behavior in most of the geographies group rote has reached in the first half and we expect to close about at the end of the year all in all our tnav plus cash dividend is growing at the double digit well on track with our target of average growth through the cycle and now we would be happy to take any of your questions thank you begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa lets open the qa session please banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions we already have the first question from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank hi good morning thank you for taking my call my question the first question would actually be on brazil margin stabilized quarteronquarter still a bit under pressure yearonyear i was wondering what type of evolution you expect for the rest of the year and also on cost of risk whats the outlook there then the second question would actually be on capital so basically the capital generation in this quarter was only basis points a bit below the run rate you have discussed in previous quarters i reckon that this partially has to do with the ph mexico minoritys incorporation but i was wondering how do you see this evolving for throughout the rest of the year and also what is behind the increase in rwas in the in this quarter thank you very much hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you carlos what ill do is ill answer the first question on brazil well give a comment on capital and then josé will tell you a little bit about whats going on with increase in rwa okay in terms of the brazil margin quarteronquarter as we say basically is explained by the following on launch since we have become much more conservative and growth and growing volumes very selectively changing the loan mix to lower risk okay so we mainly get out of credit cards went on to consignado auto loans and mortgages on deposits also the fast increasing rates has mean a rapid rise in the cost of deposits okay as well as a change of the mix on the deposits rates are staying higher for longer has prevented that the cost of deposits from coming down impacting nii remember that in brazil we have negative sensitive sensitivity to rates okay so brazil niis in the second quarter of is already flat okay as we said and josé was very precise on that the worst seems to be behind us and were already seeing a reduction on the average cost of deposits and we also see an improved customer spread okay so we expect nii in the second half of to be higher than the first half of the year leading to a flat nii in the year with a substantial improvement in okay in terms of the cost of risk not only the macro outlook is improving but since as just i explained weve been very selective in the approach of the new lending extension and focusing to more secure and higher rate customers as i explained okay this is showing good results and we believe the worst as i said repeatedly is worst sorry the worst is behind now cost of risk in the second quarter is already improving versus the first quarter and the vintages are showing really good performance as we have seen so we dont expect cost of risk that will deteriorate in brazil in versus excluding the oneoff that which implies us staying close to around okay and then to be on capital to be very precise we expect to generate at least basis points of organical capital on average per quarter with the current shareholder remuneration policy that we put in place as a result we will be banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 on track to meet our target to be above even when the final implementation of basel iii comes into effect on january 1st on okay and with that i dont know josé if you can comment on rwas please josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes thank you so morning carlos youre right loan growth was zero but riskweighted assets grew more or less half of that growth is due to fx as we consolidate the latin american basically the peso and the brazilianbased assets into the group of the other half half of the other half so a substantial amount corresponds to a stock finance and this is due to the recovery of the new auto business in europe and this will eventually translate into auto loans so this is obviously shortterm that will eventually lead to higher profitability going forward when we look at the outlook as héctor said we dont expect any significant regulatory or supervisory capital impacts in the second half of the year we see no inorganic charges in the second half of the year obviously it looks like the availableforsale portfolio valuation also will stay relatively stable we see improving profitability as we have mentioned particularly driven by higher nii in the second half and riskweighted assets that should be probably under control so netnet we see a stronger capital organic capital generation in the next couple of quarters again leading to a capital that will remain well above every quarter and building up sufficient capital to be above post basel iii begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you héctor and josé can we have the next question please operator next question from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions a couple of questions please from my side on us and spain us has obviously done much better in provisions i know youve touched on it héctor but maybe you can give a bit more detail as to why the provision was so low in the quarter is it collateral is it default rates and when you think about the rest of the year maybe you can update us about the guidance what do you expect in cost of risk for the full year i think you gave us some color in q1 maybe an updated view or the moving parts there and second question on spain deposits much more stable this quarter previous quarter i wonder if you can give again a bit more color on the deposit migration remuneration and when do you would you expect nii to peak in spain im extrapolating spain portugal which i assume has the same dynamics thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you alvaro okay let me give you an outlook in the us okay and i explained it its basically the same dynamic as i explained you on the first quarter okay credit provision as you know decreased as credit quality is remaining robust and credit net chargeoffs actually what we call realized losses showed betterthan anticipated performance and this is basically on the back of us prices continued to be strong okay as i explained and declined at slower pace than we previously anticipated banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 the change in auto loans portfolio mix are more primed remember that i told you that before we had a lot more subprime than prime and the change on the mix has helped also we have robust and betterthanexpected labor market in the us okay which is sustaining that okay and auto customers that are delinquent exactly as i was explaining in the first quarter for more than days are rolling into chargeoff status at historically low levels okay normally they were above last quarter they were around this quarter around okay so its still much better than we expect and much better than it was actually happening precovid okay and in that in we expect cost of risk to continue under normalization at around and after two years of artificially low figures given covid et cetera as i was saying normalized levels should be below prepandemic cost of risk at around if you remember prepandemic was around its never going to get there okay because of the change of mix and what i was explaining okay in terms of the spain okay in spain the deposits i mean continued to be stable okay at around we have billion okay we have excess liquidity in santander spain to the ltds around as this is the case for the whole spanish system that is around quarterly decline is mostly into cib deposits flat in retail in the quarter despite the early repayments of mortgages okay compared to the same period of and the increased volume of deposits moving off balance sheet products also what we see between the first half of versus the first half of is plus okay so we have a different change on the mix with time deposits going up at around up yearonyear while demand deposits are going down around on the back of the higher rates driven by the growth of cib which allows us to maintain also our and maintain a stable net liquidity position okay in terms of what i was saying nii we dont expect too big yet i mean we have still revisions and i will have josé explaining in detail exactly how we see nii evolution in spain josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa morning alvaro let me talk about the corporate centre of santander sa more than spain because this is going to give you a better view of our euro sensitivity to rates in the in spain so we have assets of billion floating fixed this fixed includes the alco which is billion that weve been buying recently with an average duration of six years and an interest rate of over we also have intragroup transactions et cetera money markets that are fixed but these are very shortterm so they will reprice as shortterm euribor actually goes up of the floating billion billion will reprice or reprices with 12month euribor we expect the if we use todays month euribor compared with the average of the first half so lets assume that the euribor remains flat in the first half of next year we have at least basis points pickup in the repricing of this part of the portfolio next year and then we have billion sorry billion weve repriced it with the six months billion with the three months and billion with one month so we would still expect significant repricing upwards in the first half of next year as interest rates in europe may go up once or twice but as they stabilize we will still have significant repricing of a big chunk of the portfolio in the first half of next year so obviously the asset yields are expected still to expand well into obviously margins will depend on the cost of deposits but we as héctor said were not seeing any pressures today to increase the remuneration of retail deposits we are already paying almost euribor for cib deposits institutional deposits but we dont see any banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 pressures on the retail side of deposits which means that probably the peak in net interest margins will not happen until well into in the eurozone begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you alvaro for your questions and josé and héctor for the answers can we have the next question please operator next question from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa i wanted to ask about nii in the uk and in the us if you can please update your guidance in the uk i see lending is weak falling local mortgage market is declining asset spreads are low the deposit betas is still relatively low how do you see all these dynamics going forward on the nii and also in the us you are gaining market share but are you gaining new clients or do pay enough for deposits how do you see the beta compared to the local peers and on absolute terms going forward on the nii there in the us thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you francisco okay let me give you all the details okay in the lets talk about first about the uk nii was up doubledigit in the first half of okay it was driven mainly by higher rates and a strong focus on money and spreads and profitability although the uk tends to be more competitive than other european markets as you know okay so were putting profitability ahead of market share okay and we have a lower risk appetite but were expecting good performance to continue leading to nim expansion okay so we expect it to stable to stabilize towards the second half okay with a high singledigit growth on higher rates and despite the lower volumes that we have because of why you explained about profitability okay in the second quarter nii was flattish okay higher yields on loans did not offset the higher cost of retail funding and the slowdown in new originations okay in terms of the betas josé will tell you afterwards that i tell you about whats going on in the us in terms of the us overall as you have seen has been better than expected given the change of mixed over prime okay as i explained in detail lower yield but also the risk profile and the lower grade provisioning is helping us okay nii is flattish in the quarter and yearonyear on funding pressures on the wholesale and retail as you know a lot of this is funded by wholesale as well and a common trend across the sector which has been partially offset by higher yields that we have santander us betas are above what we expected but lower than the average of our peers just to give you exactly whats going on and we expect nii to be down midsingledigit on lower originations and also the higher funding pressure again in line with the peers banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 however given the strong behavior that we have on the labor market and seeing the performance on the first half the us nii could do better than we expect okay us nii is not the only one that has been better cost of risk and profitability are also better than expected in the country okay so josé i dont know you can comment on the betas please josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa on the betas in the uk when we look at cost of deposits today relative to the level of rates today thats around slightly below its increasing slightly in the quarter percentage points we still think that it will continue so the uk market with less excess liquidity than spain for instance so we would expect as héctor said that margins probably they were stable in the second quarter relative to the first and we would expect them to remain more or less flattish in the third and probably slightly going down from there in the us as héctor said we kept our deposits flat paying less than our regional bank competitors the beta in the us is up percentage points quarteronquarter so after the spike that we saw in february march the betas in the us have remained very stable and we are actually increasing deposit market share at a lower cost than our competitors begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you riquel can we have the next question please operator next question from ignacio ulargui from bnp paribas exane please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks very much for taking my questions i have two questions one is one of the spanish loan book if you could update a bit on the trends that we have seen in the quarter yearonyear i do see an decline if you could elaborate a bit on what are the dynamics there and what we should expect going forward and the second question is a bit at a group level if i just look to the first half cost of risk its around basis points you are sticking to the guidance below basis points is there any region besides the us where we could see some deterioration in the second half that makes to keep that conservative guidance which would imply a run rate of around basis points basis points in the second half to make the basis points thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you ignacio let me tell you a little bit about whats the dynamics on the spanish loan book and then josé will talk about your second question okay in the spanish loan book the dynamic that we have seen is quite clear okay we have seen low demand of credit okay which is impacting us a little bit mainly also we have seen an increase on the prepayment mainly on the mortgages okay because of the increased rates remember that a lot of our big percentage of our portfolio is from variable rates and floating rate so in that sense thats the dynamic that we have seen and also we have seen due to the increased rates the corporates and the smes being more cautious in new credit demand okay and the dynamics we live throughout the year continuing that banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 way lets see what happens at the beginning of the year and also if we can see more confidence a little bit on investment okay but now we see the dynamics in that way please josé on the second one josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa good morning ignacio cost of risk well we see cost of risk normalizing in the us as we discussed also in mexico where we are seeing the normalization of the cost of risk as we change the business the business mix in auto it will very much depend on the amount of loans that we are able to sell but it should remain stable in the second half of the year so we feel very comfortable that we will beat our guidance for the end of the year we expect it to be better than the that we gave as a guidance begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ignacio can we have the next question please operator next question from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah this is sofie from jpmorgan thanks for taking my questions sir can you just explain there the difference between your reported net interest income which was billion and the underlying billion what explains the million delta and are there any more oneoffs in net interest income that we should be aware of i mean in the shortterm and then the second question would be on the capital headwind you mentioned that you expect it to remain above but can you just outline what capital or core equity tier headwinds you are expecting in the coming quarters or at least on the yearend and also if you could remind us what the basel iv impacts are thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay thank you ph francois so josé will explain to you the nii evolution on capital let me reiterate exactly what i said and then josé can expand a little bit so as i told you we expect to generate at least basis points of organic capital on average per quarter okay and with that is included with the current remuneration policy that we have okay so as a result what i told you we will be on track to meet our target to be above also with the final implementation of basel iii comes into effect in to be precise on that point josé will comment a little bit more on that and explain to you the nii evolution josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so sofie hi good morning as i said we dont expect any headwinds significant headwinds from any of the three big components that could affect capital regulatory or supervisory charges inorganic charges or other charges basically marketrelated pensions intangibles we dont significant headwinds in the second half of the year banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 in terms of basel iii we have seen the proposal is still a proposal so we need to wait to see exactly how is how the regulation is approved we still think we will have an impact of between basis points to basis points probably and again depending on how this is finally written probably towards the lower end of that range if things are confirmed when the final proposal is approved in terms of the accounting well i think investor relations will give you more details about this this is pretty detailed but in the first half there is no impact no adjustments between net interest income statutory and underlying zero what happened in the first quarter is we had a net positive adjustment of million and we have reversed exactly the same amount in the second quarter which by the way in terms of the billion its a very small amount so no adjustment to nii in the first half what we added to underlying in the first quarter was reversed in the second quarter there are other adjustments in the pl but basically netting out in most cases will happen in the first quarter in the second quarter but investor relations will give you all the details linebyline of the differences between the first and the second quarter thanks sofie begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you sofie can we have the next question please operator next question from marta sanchez romero from citi please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thank you very much my first question is on the digital bank could you please provide an update on your strategy for gathering deposits here youve raised roughly billion yeartodate that seems a bit below what you had planned a few months ago and then deposit ratio is running at so how much more deposits do you expect to get and where do you feel like you need to put rate in order to be more successful in northern europe and germany the second question is a followup on mortgages in the uk you are shrinking pretty fast billion per quarter when do you expect to stabilize that book thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thank you marta okay on the strategy terms the openbank is quite clear okay and we just dont have openbank as the only vehicle to raise deposits we have some other vehicles also we have in some of the other different countries okay we believe that the strategy is right and the one that we manage with openbank is going along our expectations and we believe that we are going to continue to manage that accordingly okay and in the some other different initiatives that we have for example in germany and some other places the strategy has been proving very successful and we dont believe we need to basically continue raising rates depending on what the market reacts to it okay so were going to be moving it according to the market in terms of mortgages in the uk i was very specific about what were thinking in terms of profitability okay and the way were managing the portfolio first of all weve been very cautious in the way we manage and our risk appetite is being very prudent in the way were managing the uk okay if we see there is a change of how we see the market then well adjust at the point but right now were concentrated in the two things i told you first of banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 all profitability and being cautious on the risk appetite there if we see one of these changes then well adjust in anyway i dont know josé if youd like to comment on that a bit more josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa in the digital consumer bank that now includes openbank we have billion in deposits like you said and i think we obviously manage that to maximize profitability so its not only a question of the amount of deposits but the question is managing the margins in a business that has negative sensitivity to rates and i think weve been very successful if you compared this figure to what it was a couple of years ago and you look at margins and interest rate sensitivity management i think you have to look at the whole picture and i think weve been very successful in managing interest rate sensitivity in a business that is naturally has naturally negative sensitivity to recent rates hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa thanks marta begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you marta can we have the next question please operator next question from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes and the question indiscernible going to the different geographies and particularly youve given a lot of detail on nii in a lot of countries can you do the same for brazil please the second question is on spain if you could split the drivers of nii there between bit of increases in interest rates of deposit beta and the alco portfolio contribution thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay thank you andrea let me explain a little bit the nii in brazil and then josé will give you the details of the drivers of nii and the betas in spain okay in spain so to start i mean brazil nii okay performance in recent quarters explained first of all on loans since ive been very specific on that we have become very much conservative and we have changed the mix okay and we have grown volumes selectively okay changing the loan mix to lower risk on deposits okay the fast increasing rates means a rapid rise in the cost of deposits okay we expect nii in the second half of to be higher than in the first half of the year leading to a flat nii in the year with a substantial improvement in okay if we see that the rates basically start to come down because its very important to understand that brazil has negative sensitivity to the rates we should gain traction and we maintain were going to maintain our cautious stance but we believe that we can go back to the market okay and we believe that ph functional rates could fall in the second half bringing the cost down in retail funding okay banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 and then in the drivers of nii in spain and also we give you more details spain is one of the countries that has benefited most from the higher rates okay we continue to see strong growth in clients just in the first half of the year we have more active clients okay nii in spain is up around in the first half of the year and just alone in the second quarter its mostly supported by repricing of the loan portfolio the higher yields and remain contained on the cost of deposits so we have been managing very well in that sense we expect doubledigit growth for nii in and regarding the peak of nii in spain there are several things to consider that josé already explained you assets will continue to reprice at least during the first half of clients which we expect will continue to grow and betas which will be key are were still seeing a rational competition with low betas for individuals in a system which remains highly liquid okay so as of today we dont expect much higher remuneration on the foreseeable future josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so hi andrea the alco in spain we have billion alco billion is a structural longterm heldtocollect with an average maturity of duration of years and a yield of and then we have billion which is more associated with shortterm liquidity management average duration of years and yields slightly below we expect to continue increasing the amount of the alco portfolio in spain to gradually reposition the balance sheet towards a lower positive sensitivity because as interest rates start reaching a peak we dont want to run a balance sheet with such huge positive sensitivity to rates so one way of doing that is not the only we are also taking other measures but one way is obviously increasing the alco portfolio in terms of betas the beta for deposits in spain is if we exclude cib by the way this is percentage points higher than in the first quarter if we exclude cib the beta is the beta in cib is around so i think ive given you all the numbers to figure it out exactly how we see the betas and the nii going forward thanks begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you andrea can we have the next question please operator next question from britta schmidt from autonomous please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research llp yeah hi there thanks for taking my question could you give a bit more color on the nii increase the absolute nii increase in spain qonq the customer spread was up less in the previous quarter but nii was up a lot more and then secondly could also update us on the net interest income sensitivity in brazil over one year and two years and lastly on the million rate benefits that you see more so than previously can you give us an idea as to where you see them and how much of that has been recognized in the current run rate thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay so let me go backwards here yeah in the first half the sensitivity was more or less million higher than what we the guidance we gave in at the investor day we would expect more or less a similar amount in banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 the second half in euros so we relative to the figures we gave at investor day the interest rate sensitivity in euros due to the fact that obviously rates are higher and we are seeing betting betas remember that the betas we used to give that sensitivity at investor day in euros was around we are below right now and its already half of the year so we would expect another million more in the second half over billion higher than what we mentioned at investor day nii sensitivity in brazil im going to give you the rest of the currencies as well so if today we had basis points parallel shift upwards we would make billion billion more in euros million more in the uk flat and slightly negative in the us and million less in brazil i think we gave you all the details to understand the nii sensitivity in spain but we can take it offline and if you wanted more detailed analysis but i think we gave you all the details ill give you the composition of the balance sheet by repricing on the asset side so i think thats sufficient i think but we will take it offline begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you britta can we have the next question please operator next question from carlos cobo catena from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi hi thank you very much for taking my questions just a quick followup from me on capital you mentioned the stock finance impact could you please quantify that in terms of stock and one single specific impact on risk weighted assets just to clear that out some of the impact thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa okay so the stock finance is seasonal it tends to go up in december which is the peak in the year then goes it goes down in march goes up a little bit in june and then same in september to peak again in december this year the increase in june was higher than we expected we are talking around billion in total riskweighted assets from stock finance in the first half begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos can we have what i believe is the last question please and if anybody wants to add another question operator instructions thank you operator next question from fernando gil de santivanes from bestinver please go ahead fernando gil de santivanes dornellas q analyst bestinver sociedad de valores sa all right thank you for taking my questions two questions please one is in poland what do you expect in terms of mortgage provisions related to risk funds going forward if you can comment on that that would be useful helpful banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 and second one is on rwa growth on looking at uk figures and poland figures and looking at loans loan growth and fx impact it seems like rwa is increasing faster than that and if you can comment on what is happening there in those particular regions and then i have a followup thank you very much hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay sorry fernando what you said at the beginning was mortgage provisions in poland fernando gil de santivanes dornellas a analyst bestinver sociedad de valores sa yeah hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay so fernando let me tell you exactly how we are in poland okay up to today okay and with the extra that we did okay we believe that is completely adequate okay were talking about that in the blended provisions that we have we are provisioned up to okay of the outstanding that we have okay and we believe thats enough to sustain exactly what needs to be done over there given the dynamics that we have seen in the market and if youre basically changing to a indiscernible when the these mortgages has started theyll be about there okay so i believe that were at the right point and we believe the provisions at this level is completely adequate okay on the second i will have josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa as hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa give you the answer thank you josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa i explained loan growth yearonyear was zero riskweighted assets increased half of which is fx and i can take you through the composition of riskweighted assets by country but half of the riskweighted asset inflation has to do with fx of the other half we had some positives and negatives as i said we have contraction in the uk we have contraction in terms of riskweighted assets exstock finance in auto and slight contraction in europe and then we had the stock finance expansion in europe and also riskweighted asset growth both in fx effects in mexico and in brazil begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you fernando im unclear if there are any further questions operator we have a question from the line of ignacio cerezo from ubs please go ahead banco santander sa san corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2023 ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi good morning so its just a quick followup on brazil if you can give us a little bit more color or at least ballpark magnitude of the substantial growth of nii youre expecting in and the sensitivity to rate also was mentioned and suggests probably around yeah for basis points decline so just trying to understand basically what kind of magnitude in terms of acceleration of nii you are expecting next year in brazil thank you hector blas grisi checa a chief executive officer director banco santander sa okay thank you ignacio i will answer the first part of the question and then josé will help me out with the rest okay this is sensitivity what i told you is that we believe that the worst is over in brazil okay and were starting to see a little bit more growth in the portfolio okay so were changing that around were starting to basically go back to the open market which in we decided basically to come out of it given the what we saw in the current environment okay so at this point we believe that brazil is going to be able to turn around and also we see that the rates are going to be helping us out because we believe that the rate in august should start coming down so in that sense we dont know exactly how the trends are going to work but we see that is this is coming much better than we expect okay and we see that were going to end up the year basically flattish to where we started okay josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa so hi ignacio we believe interest rates in brazil will start coming down in august they are at our central scenario is for rates to end the year at around and then probably below by the end of next year so nii when you look at sequentially quarteronquarter nii probably will be flattish in the third but it should increase in the fourth and more so into next year and the exact sensitivity i mentioned the sensitivity to higher rates but the sensitivity in brazil to basis point but this is a parallel shift i insist the parallel shift which is not will happen probably because what we will see is lower rates in the short end of the curve but flattish in the long end of the curve but through a parallel shift a drop in basis points will generate million higher revenue in brazil thank you ignacio begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ignacio i believe there are no further questions so thank you everybody for your attendance and the
