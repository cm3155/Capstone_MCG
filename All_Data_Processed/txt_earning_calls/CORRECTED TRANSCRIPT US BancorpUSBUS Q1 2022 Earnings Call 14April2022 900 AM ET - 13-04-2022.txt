strong loan growth continued momentum in our payments businesses well controlled expenses and strong credit quality as expected mortgage banking revenue declined in the first quarter due to slower refinancing activity in the market however we saw good momentum in business activity and related revenue growth within other fee businesses including payments trust and investment management and treasury management this quarter we released million in loan loss reserves reflecting continued strong credit quality and at march our cet1 capital ratio was slide provides key performance metrics in the first quarter we delivered a return on assets of and a return on tangible common equity of slide highlights trends in digital engagement digital transactions account for over of total transactions and total digital loan sales account for about twothirds of total loan sales we are pleased with the progress we have seen so far but believe there is further opportunity to increase customer engagement through digital adoption by helping consumers and business customers understand the full scope of capabilities available to assist them in managing their financial lives us bancorp usb

slide we believe our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for our company the opportunity to connect our banking customers with our payments products and services and our payments customers with our banking products and services will continue to drive meaningful profit and return ph differential for our company over the next several years our small business initiative is just one example of many that we see driving both account growth and deeper relationships we believe the suite of products we offer to our small business customers will allow us to grow those relationships by to and related revenue by to over the next few years we are particularly encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the uptake of our talech pointofsale functionality which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple easytouse format that we provide in the form of a dashboard on the right side of the slide you can see that the number of new talech customers increased fivefold in compared with and that strong growth trajectory has continued in yeartodate new talech customers are times the full year level now let me turn the call over to terry to provide more details on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of first quarter earnings trends average loans increased compared with the fourth quarter driven by growth in commercial loans growth in mortgage loans and growth in total other retail loans commercial loan growth reflected slowing paydowns increased business activity and higher utilization rates across many sectors and most geographies client sentiment is stable and commercial lending needs are being driven by inventory building ma activity and capex expenditures in the retail portfolio we saw good growth in residential mortgage and other retail loans including auto lending credit card balances declined linkedquarter reflecting typical seasonality and the impact of certain loans being moved to heldforsale in the fourth quarter which impacted average balance growth turning to slide total average deposits increased compared with the fourth quarter despite the typical seasonal reduction in noninterestbearing deposits total average deposits increased compared with the year ago slide shows credit quality trends credit quality continues to be strong across our loan portfolio the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at march compared with at december and a yearago our first quarter net chargeoff ratio of was slightly higher than the fourth quarter level of but lower compared with the first quarter of level of our allowance for credit losses as of march totaled billion or of periodend loans us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 slide provides an earnings summary in the first quarter of we earned per diluted share these results included a relatively small reserve release of million turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis totaled billion the linked quarter increase reflected strengthening margins and strong loan growth in the quarter particularly commercial loan growth our net interest margin improved basis points to due to the changing yield curve investment portfolio actions and lower cash balances partially offset by the impact of loan mix slide highlights trends in noninterest income compared with a yearago noninterest income increased reflecting strong payments services revenue growth in trust and investment management fees and higher treasury management fees offset by lower commercial product revenue and lower mortgage banking revenue the decline in mortgage banking revenue reflected lower refinancing activity in the market and tighter gain on sale margins giving excess capacity in the industry in the first quarter total payments revenues increased compared to a year earlier reflecting both continued cyclical postpandemic recovery as well as strong underlying business trends supported by investments we are making credit and debit card revenue increased on a yearoveryear basis as the impact of higher credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity excluding prepaid card revenue credit and debit card fee revenue would have increased compared with the first quarter of both corporate payment products revenue and merchant processing fees increased at a doubledigit pace compared with a yearago with growth driven by both the cyclical recovery of pandemicimpacted industries as well as underlying business momentum slides and provide additional information on our payment services business in the middle of slide we provide a table which illustrates the cyclicality that naturally occurs in each of our three payments businesses over the course of a typical year on the right side of the slide you can see that covid19impacted industries continued to recover throughout the first quarter as of the first quarter of credit and debit card travel volumes exceeded prepandemic levels in march of airline volume was flat compared to march of the first time we have seen recovery to prepandemic levels although terelated volumes in our corporate payments business are still below prepandemic levels they continue their upward trajectory in march corporate te volumes in cps were back to of the prepandemic level slide provides linkedquarter and yearoveryear revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses we believe yearoveryear trends are the best indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment yearoveryear credit and debit card revenue growth rates continued to be negatively impacted by the decline in prepaid card revenue as the benefit of the government stimulus has dissipated we provide details on prepaid card fee revenue over the past five quarters in the upper right quadrant while prepaid card revenue is approaching a run rate on a linkedquarter basis it would impact yearoveryear credit and debit card fee revenue comparisons through the end of the bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong yearoveryear growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue over the past several quarters which have partly reflected the pandemicrelated recovery while we expect the yearoveryear growth rates to moderate from current levels we continue to believe that both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue can grow at a high singledigit pace on a yearoveryear basis in a postpandemic environment us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 turning to slide noninterest expense decreased on a linkedquarter basis the decline was driven by lower professional services expense marketing and business development expense and technology and communication expenses partially offset by increases in employee benefit expense primarily due to seasonally higher payroll taxes and other noninterest expenses linkedquarter expense growth includes the impact of the acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at march was as a reminder at the beginning of the third quarter of we suspended our share buyback program due to the pending acquisition of union bank after closing the acquisition we expect to operate at a cet1 ratio between our target ratio and we continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our cet1 ratio reaches following the pending deal close i will now provide some forwardlooking guidance the following guidance is for us bank on a standalone basis and does not include any potential impact from union bank let me start with full year guidance we have updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with market expectations given our revised interest rate assumptions we now expect total net revenue to increase to compared with reflecting to growth in taxableequivalent net interest income and stable fee income primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges offsetting growth in other fee businesses we expect positive operating leverage of at least basis points in as it relates to the second quarter specifically we expect total revenue growth of to on a linkedquarter basis benefiting from seasonal strength in many of our fee businesses continued loan growth and the second quarter impact of higher rates on net interest income and the recapture of fee waivers in the second quarter we expect expenses to increase to on a linkedquarter basis primarily due to seasonally higher compensationrelated cost and business investment spend credit quality remains strong over the next few quarters we expect the net chargeoff ratio to remain lower than historical levels but will continue to normalize over time for the full year we expect our taxableequivalent tax rate to be approximately to if you turn to slide ill provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of union bank in september of we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of mufg union bank we continued to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal in the first half of while we await regulatory approval as you know regulatory approvals are not within the companys control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal we expect to close the deal approximately days after being granted us regulatory approval conversion is anticipated late in the second half of we continue to believe this deal is a compelling use of our excess capital from both a strategic and financial perspective we feel comfortable with our initial financial deal assumptions including an expectation that it will generate an internal rate of return of about which is well above our cost of capital assuming a june close date we expect union bank to contribute approximately million to our pretax preprovision net revenue in before considering cost synergies we continue to expect to achieve approximately million of total cost synergies related to the deal with approximately million to million of cost savings achieved in the second half of we continue to target total merger and integration us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 costs of billion of which approximately million will be incurred in with some charges anticipated in the second quarter as we prepare for system integration in addition there will be a day one loan loss provision required at closing in accordance with the existing cecl accounting rules of approximately million to million ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry our strong first quarter results position us well for the rest of the year and we are encouraged by the loan growth trends and business activity that we are seeing in the early part of the second quarter credit quality remains strong nonetheless we continue to approach credit decisions with a throughthecycle lens we feel good about the secular trends we are seeing across our fee businesses our payments revenue continues to recover and we look to continued cyclical recovery in travel and entertainment as the year progresses more importantly over the near and intermediate term our multiyear investments in this business and the strategic initiatives aimed at leveraging the power of our payments ecosystem will continue to pay off we are closely managing operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives our payments capabilities and our technology modernization on that front id like to highlight a few of our recent announcements we enhanced a service that we call extendpay an offering which allows our existing consumer and business cardholders to a buynowpaylater option where they can choose a flexible payment plan that suits their needs we also rolled out a request for payment capability which allows merchants to send bills directly to customers banks accounts those customers have the option to send payment immediately to the biller via realtime payment rails in february we announced a meaningful investment in our cloud strategy which is aimed at modernizing our technology foundation so as to further improve the security of our data financial assets and customer privacy while allowing for the transformation of applications and infrastructure to create leadingedge customer experiences we will continue to leverage our suite of products services and capabilities to enhance the customer experience which we believe will support meaningful account growth and deeper relationships across our entire franchise over the next several years in closing is off to a good start and id like to thank our employees for all they do to support our strategic goals and continue to serve our customers and communities we will now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you could andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc provide an update on asset sensitivity of usb standalone and then the impact of ub i know at one point you said it was going to make you a little more assetsensitive but obviously the rate environment has changed im not really sure whats happened to their balance sheet so some updates there on asset sensitivity please terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah matt let me kind of take that question with respect to asset sensitivity and im going to kind of refer back to maybe the disclosures we had in the 10k and probably the best one to look at would be kind of an upward gradual basis point movement i think that that is at least the environment that the market implied with indiscernible point in time so if you end up applying that rate sensitivity of about to the fourth quarter i think it gives you a pretty good estimate of what sort of benefit that we see in terms of net interest income kind of going forward maybe kind of qualitatively i think that when we see early in the cycle deposit betas will be relatively low our portfolio when you look at loans its probably about is floating rate and about to is fixed rate so that matt probably gives you some perspective with respect to kind of what were expecting to see from a union bank point of view as weve said in the past it is a bit more assetsensitive than us it should help us kind of i would say to basis points when you end up looking at their portfolio and the assets that well be acquiring its depositheavy so well have substantial amount of cash and the opportunity to be able to reinvest that as rates move up matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately you gave the impact of the ub deal on tangible book value i think it was just a reduction whats the estimated impact on cet1 capital both from the actual acquisition and then the upfront mark that you mentioned earlier us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so as weve said currently were at in terms of our cet1 ratio we would expect itll be in the range of that to at the end of the closing of course itll be dependent upon how much rates move between now and the actual closing time i talked a little bit about the day one provision in terms of the credit mark from an asset mark i think itll be a little bit higher than what we had originally anticipated or disclosed in at the time of the acquisition simply because of the rise in rates but not significantly different matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks and just a suggestion by the way lots of good guidance on the call it would be great if you could put some of it in the slides its just such a busy day and scrambling to jot it all down some of your peers do that and its really helpful for us on this side thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah we would anticipate well start to incorporate more of that as the deal moves forward operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the card and payment side just curious if you can just give us a little bit more detail on what youre seeing in terms of consumer spend behavior are you seeing any signs of any pullbacks and shifts in the type of spend that could point to some softening there were starting to see some shifts towards nondiscretionary from discretionary spend curious if youre seeing that in your business if that is impacting your outlook at all terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so let me start and then andy can kind of add to it certainly what we are continuing to see john through the first quarter is good strong both yearoveryear growth and comparisons back to really across the board i think a couple of the trends that we talked about is that travel specifically airline was back to pre pandemic so thats continuing to develop and grow and thats occurred specifically in march and i think youll see that continuing as we think about the second quarter and beyond us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 we do continue to expect in the cps business that travel and entertainment is going to continue to strengthen and i think that that is a tailwind or an opportunity for us as we move forward i would expect that theres probably going to be a shift to some extent from what i would call durable goods that people were spending their dollars on in the past to more serviceoriented sort of activities but in terms of the overall level of spend i feel like that will continue at least for some period of time andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think thats a good summary terry john its interesting because consumer spend on the merchant side if we look at that data versus prepandemic levels in the first quarter still up to consumer credit card spend still up versus prepandemic and corporate payments still up the one area terry mentioned that is not back to recovery yet is corporate te which is about of what is normal or prepandemic levels and we would expect that to continue to get better as we all start to get out on the road more so were not seeing any negative trends thus far and it continues to be very strong john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you thats helpful and then on the commercial side i know you cited in your prepared remarks that you are beginning to see capex plans as a driver behind the loan growth dynamics on the commercial side do you expect that to continue as we look out here or do you foresee a potential impact on borrower appetite amid still the inflationary dynamics and supply chain issues and ukraine terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think that the capital expenditure is probably driven by a couple different things i think that most businesses over the course of the last couple years have been kind of holding back with respect to capital expenditure and so i think that theres a bit of an increase in that spend just related to that and then i do think that as companies see more and more inflationary pressure they are going to look to business and business automation as ways of kind of offsetting some of the pressure that they see with respect to being actually to acquire talent and so i think that our expectation at least in the near term is that capital expenditure will continue to be reasonably strong andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and i think our utilization rates support that terry we have been running in that plus or minus for a number of quarters and we saw it increase certainly not to normal levels but in the to in the last few months terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 got it okay thanks thats very helpful andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning betsy terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi betsy ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi this is ryan kenny on behalf of betsy good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey ryan ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on deposit betas so now that you mentioned that early in the cycle youre expecting deposit betas to be relatively low so on one hand you have an industry with a lot of excess liquidity but then on the other hand you have consumers that might be a little bit more cognizant of rate hikes coming faster with inflation on the headlines every day you have rising fintech competition so putting that all together im wondering how youre thinking about deposit betas really over the first bps and then the following rates after that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe i think its helpful to maybe have a little context when you end up looking at our deposit balances about of it is consumerbased and of it is institutional if you will which tends to have a little bit of a higher beta but our expectation especially early in the cycle is that betas will move relatively slow and then as we get further into the development of the cycle itll start to accelerate a bit but to kind of give you some perspective we would expect probably through the full cycle of that betas on the consumer will be less than and then maybe slightly higher that on a terminal basis on the institutional side we would expect through the cycle somewhere between and with a terminal level thats maybe a little bit higher than that us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 couple things to that as we are looking at it we believe that relative to for example the last cycle that our deposit betas will be a little bit less sensitive for a couple of different reasons one is the consumer balances are larger by about relative to the last cycle our corporate trust deposit balances are lower and so the mix of the deposit basis change and then we have moved away from concentrations related to brokeragerelated type of deposits which we had more of in the past we still have some but a lower concentration so all of those things are going to drive lower beta growth than what we saw in the past ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks thats really helpful color and then just as a followup wondering if you could dig into the book value per share decline of linkedquarter how much of that came from aoci drawdowns on the afs portfolio and is there anything you can do to mitigate the aoci hit going forward if the rate outlook keeps moving higher terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah the vast majority if not all of it was really tied to the change in the unrealized gains and losses on the investment portfolio and then the driver when we think about the future we started to change a couple of different things so in the fourth quarter we moved about billion of our investment securities to heldtomaturity as we are reinvesting runoff associated with the investment portfolio well continue to move more and more of that into the heldto maturity sort of category and then certainly as we close on union bank we have the opportunity after the mark to move a lot of that into heldtomaturity as well so today about of the overall portfolio is in the heldto maturity category and our expectation is over some period of time we would move that percentage up significantly ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of ubs your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just putting together the most recent question and also on matts question underneath the to nii growth could you give us a little bit more of a breakdown in terms of what youre expecting for asset growth given the strength in your loan book today and terry indiscernible shortterm borrowings but periodend by billion and again going back to the question i think everybody is trying to ask remind us how much of your deposit base is corporate trust today and of those deposits how much are indexed do they reprice immediately to the changes in underlying benchmark rates or do you have some ability and pricing power to be able to perhaps delay some of that repricing us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so let me start with the last question and then kind of talk a little bit about the deposits and then to the extent that i dont cover everything just remind me but deposits in the corporate trust business or in institutional the investment services group which includes corporate trust represent about of the total interestbearing deposits now in the last rate cycle that was about so its down relative to the overall mix and then the vast majority of it is not indexed to any particular rate and so we do have the ability to manage that a fair amount of the deposits within corporate trust are noninterestbearing as well which i think is helpful that percentage is probably a little bit higher than what it was in the past but the competitive pressure will really come as money market funds start to move up we do have the ability to lag relative to that but thats where some of that competitive pressure comes from erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc a followup on the underlying earning asset assumption that you have underneath the yeah terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so when we end up looking at earning assets our expectation is that the investment portfolio will be relatively flat or stable really through the end of the year and the vast majority of the growth will come on the loan portfolio side of the equation as we look into the second quarter our expectation is that loan growth will continue to be strong and this and as reminder it was up on a linkedquarter basis about and while it may not be at that level i think itll still be up on a linkedquarter basis very nicely and we would continue to expect good solid growth in the ci portfolio as well as credit cards will start to seasonally get stronger et cetera erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and a followup question to matts question on cet1 when you close union bank i think im estimating your total asset size to be just shy of billion and how should we think about capital management as you potentially approach billion asset mark in two years andy and terry and im just wondering in context of the tce hit was obviously more than the cet1 hit because aoci doesnt run through your cet1 so i guess im wondering in terms of like buybacks even after you replenish to as you think about crossing the billion how that might influence your capital management and capital return potentially differently over the next two years terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah erika i think your estimates with respect to the total size are reasonable our expectation is that to kind of give you some perspective when you end up looking at the rules the rules say that you need to be at an average of over a fourquarter period above million sic billion so theres a bit of runway that exists between now and when we might become a category two sort of entity some of the actions that i talked about with respect to the heldtomaturity composition of the investment portfolio i think will help kind of mitigate that certainly well generate a fair amount of earnings between now and lets say six or seven quarters out and i think all those things will kind of help us manage through that timeframe us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 the other thing is that when we do close on union bank its depositheavy in terms of the mix so there will be a significant amount of cash and we would expect to utilize that to help us manage borrowings down and things like that in order to be able to stay below that billion threshold for an extended period of time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it just to clarify as you close ub the intention for the cash is not to deploy it but to shrink the pro forma balance sheet to be able to accommodate more client growth rather than just raw balance sheet growth from terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp exactly exactly erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks so much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks erika operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys just a question on fees to start in your revenue guide do you fully contemplate the full recovery of fee waivers which i think you said youve been running around million how much do you have that recovering in and i assume thats also fully recovered in the full year guide terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so to answer the last piece yes it would be fully recovered certainly by the end of the year and just given kind of projections in the marketplace with respect to rates well see a significant amount of that recovered in the second quarter with the residual amount kind of in the third quarter maybe as a reminder we recover about of it in the first basis point movement of it in the next basis point movement and all of it after the third basis point movement so most of it in the second quarter but some amount in the third andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so about of it comes back in the second quarter terry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you terry and then also just on the mortgage business obviously the reset that you had given us the expectation for just your outlook from here given where rates have gone and the ins and outs of production and servicing thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah obviously the mortgage banking business is going to trend along with at this particular point in time refinancings the mix of business is probably home sales and refinancing so on a linkedquarter basis the impact of refinancings will be less than what it has been in the past so itll come down to kind of home sale activity we continue to think that thatll be reasonably strong and our investment in kind of the retail channel will be good i think the things thatll be drivers ken in the future on a linkedquarter basis will really be where do gainonsale margins go and thatll be driven based upon how fast the capacity comes out of the system but at least at this particular point in time just looking at kind of industry metrics i think is a good way of kind of thinking about how well perform as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo of wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just to clarify so you improved guidance revenues from to to to nii from to to and operating leverage from basis points to basis points i just want to make sure i have my facts straight there is that correct terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp you got it mike us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so that improved guidance how much of that is due simply to higher interest rates how much of that is due to better loan growth and how much of that is due to payments or some other activities terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think that again we would expect that fee income will be relatively stable on a yearoveryear basis so when you end up looking at whats going to be the driver itll be net interest income and from here on out i think its going to be kind of a balance between loan growth and interest rates because if i had to kind of give you a mix and i dont necessarily have that with me but its probably rates and on the loan portfolio growth side of the equation mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so your commercial loan growth is kind of fast and i think you said there might have been a onetime element in there but what sort of commercial loan growth are you expecting is this the big pivot recovery from the pandemic is it inventory build is it capex is it differences by region this might wind up being some of the best commercial loan growth that we see on a linkedquarter basis percentagewise than any big bank so just a little more color around that would be great andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure mike ill start this is andy and terry will add on its across all those categories i mentioned earlier and there is no onetimer in there so it is core growth one of the factors is our utilization rates as i mentioned have been hovering in that 19orso percent and theyre up nearly which is a key component which is again take downs to fund all those things you talked about which is capex and inventory growth and other activities its fairly widespread its true within our large corporate as well as our middle market and spread geographically as well so it is strength across many categories terry what would you add terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp the other thing i would just say is that well start to see some seasonal benefit associated with the credit card portfolio as we get into the second and third quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then the other part of that question related to payments i think payments was a little bit of a disappointment for a little bit of time and now its come back a little bit this quarter yearoveryear growth so i guess is payments back or not back or is it performing to your expectations are there still headwinds or is the recovery from the pandemic helping that business just how do you think about payments relative to your own expectations and the markets expectations us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean were very excited about the payments business i think theres a number of dynamics that are taking place i think theres still cyclical recovery thats going to continue on for some period of time and youre going to see that in the airline and travel and entertainment and those sorts of areas i think thats all good mike weve talked a lot about investments that weve been making in our payments businesses and over the course of the last few years as an example within the merchant acquiring three years ago or so our techled sort of revenue represented about of our overall merchant acquiring revenue today it represents and we would expect that to continue to accelerate because of investments that were making we talked about the fact that in a normal environment as the cyclical recovery kind of starts to wane that we would expect our merchant acquiring and our cps business to grow in high singledigits thats two or three times what we were seeing lets say four years ago when we started our investment so we feel really good about where were at from a payments perspective at this particular point andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think thats right and mike when you asked about the guidance and terry mentioned that fees are relatively stable that is mortgage coming down a fair bit as well as deposit service charges with some of the changes that we made in overdrafts which is offset positively by some of our payments businesses and the expectations that we now have for the full year as well as the trust businesses so theres some value and diversification of those revenue streams and its coming through in payments and trust mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc that was a detailed answer if i could just push the limit so any numbers around the payments growth should it be high single digits can you keep that growth up or should it settle back down to a lower range terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again i think if you end up looking at the components merchant and cps on an ongoing basis high singledigits i think credit card will be probably at a lower level than that but itll be consistent with the way the rest of the industry is growing andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and part of that credit card comp mike is the prepaid impacts of prior year is still impacting the comps yearover year in mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp indiscernible vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc andy morning terry just a clarification there so the high singledigit on merchant processing and corporate payments are you referring to that for or beyond because the credit card should be hurt in but after that those comps should get easier so what do you think post for credit cards so just want to clarify those terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp again for merchant and cps we think post2022 high singledigits and we believe that credit card will perform kind of consistent with the rest of the industry the comps as you say this year will be impacted by the prepaid card revenue that is coming down but then that starts to normalize as you get into vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and within this high singledigits are you expecting any more big contract renewals that could impact this or is that factored into your guidance or are you just not expecting much of that to come up in indiscernible terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah we dont expect a lot of that the large contracts that got renegotiated were more on the cps side of the equation about two years ago and thats kind of fully in the run rate at this particular point in time as you know those contracts are usually years in length so we dont see anything on the horizon there vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay one request and that is fico mix of your loan portfolios i know weve talked about this in the past could you look into actually disclosing it your peers do and i think given your high consumer mix of loans it would be very helpful to have that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp all right thanks vivek well take a look at that thanks for the feedback us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi terry hi andy terry following up your comments on the mortgage banking business with the rates where they are and possibly going higher probably depressing refinancing activity for the industry as well as yourselves because of the higher rates can you attempt or can you look to growing your home equity business home equity lines et cetera this business of course for the industry and yourselves has been a line of business that has been shrinking over the years but could that be an alternative to people refinancing moving into home equity lines andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think that it certainly wont shrink at the same level it has been shrinking gerard just for the reasons you mentioned because of refinancing people would have money out and that would replace home equity so to speak so i think youll see a positive trend there it certainly is not going to offset the mortgage impacts directly but i think it will be positive gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and is there any plan on your guys part to maybe be more aggressive in marketing those products or have you not really thought about that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp were always looking at opportunities to serve the customers in areas they need another sort of related is the whole buynowpaylater component that we talked about i mentioned some examples in my prepared remarks but as you think about home equity improvements a new way of financing that is through a buynowpaylater or financing a pointofsale so thats something were also focused on gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 got it and then second obviously us bancorp has distinguished itself over the years with having a very strong focus on credit and delivering very strong returns to shareholders the question i have because credit obviously is not an issue today for most banks yours included when do you start to get nervous or do you get nervous in this interest rate environment the fed comes through and we have basis points of fed funds at the end of the year and possibly a 10year thats well above how do you guys kind of think about that when you assess the risks for the business here at us bancorp terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah fair question and i think theres a lot more conversation around that in terms of whether or not there will be recessionary sort of pressures to months out i would start by just saying when we end up looking at the economic outlook right now and kind of what were seeing we continue to see a pretty robust environment that said gerard i think its a fair question because credit issues that we decisions we made today and a year ago are whats going to affect us and we never really changed our underwriting approach weve always been very focused on as an example in the consumer side we focus on prime and super prime customers in our card business in our auto business et cetera i think the mortgage just the underwriting associated with mortgages is different today than it was years ago which will help but then on the ci side of the equation or the corporate side of the equation we do very little leverage lending sort of activities and areas that have been kind of structurally impacted like retail et cetera retail malls et cetera weve kind of made a lot of changes to our portfolio the last several years so i actually think that well perform quite well in the event that we were to see recessionary pressures develop gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and terry just to follow up there how about from a balance sheet standpoint you talked about moving more of your availableforsale into heldtomaturity in your bond portfolio in this rising rate environment do we start to see greater risks in that part of the business not just for us bancorp but maybe for the industry as well terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp within for example the investment portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc correct correct just the marks that people may have to take i know heldtomaturity you dont marktomarket but im just wondering because we havent had to focus on this in god years and im just wondering if theres something that we need to keep our eyes open for terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean i think its worthwhile just kind of trying to understand the mix of the types of investment securities that people are putting into their particular portfolio when you get into stress in the economy et cetera certain types of investments may not perform as well in terms of our own portfolio highly concentrated in treasury and governmentbacked mortgagebacked securities so we dont see a lot of credit risk in our particular portfolio but it is something i think from an industry standpoint its worthwhile watching us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate all the color thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gerard operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens your line is now open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions if i go back to september i think you expected to realize of the cost savings from union this year which was about million terry i believe on the call was it million to million this year and is that just simply a function of pushing out the conversion too late in terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes its all related to the timing terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then your thoughts on the full by the end of the year any kind of update on when the bulk of that savings will occur terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean i think that the bulk of that savings we certainly start to realize some of it later this year but the bulk of it does get realized in and certainly when we get close to the end of the fourth quarter and first quarter of the vast majority of it will be realized so i think the timing is very consistent with what we talked about just affected by the timing of the deal terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc understood thank you and then as a followup the decline in noninterestbearing deposits i think that was on an average basis in the release it was seasonal kind of factors coming into play anything beyond that in terms of the decline or do you truly think that was just a seasonal component terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah with our corporate trust business we always see a rampup in that type of deposit near the end of the year as deals try to get closed and almost like clockwork around the 10th of january and through february we see a runoff so its all really seasonal from our standpoint us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you terry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning terry and andy i apologize if this was talked about before i might have missed it but i wanted to ask if you could comment on as we think about this runoff of the fed balance sheet happening faster than when we exited the last zirp cycle and the risk of noninterestbearing deposits outflowing perhaps a bit faster and perhaps impacts on deposit betas could you comment on that and if you already have ill just go back to the transcript terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah no its a good question and as we kind of go through the modeling and we look at the information and kind of how we think its going to end up affecting not only us but i think the industry is that youre going to see that deposit growth is going to slow and our expectation is certainly that deposit levels overall will grow slowly and thatll be more in line with just the overall growth of the economy so our expectation is that deposits continue to grow but at a lower rate bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and then following up on your commentary i believe andy around new pointofsale solutions that youre looking at there seems to be a little bit of debate among some banks who appear willing to promote the use of zelle for retail payments versus others that would prefer to wait can you remind us where usb stands in that debate and how you think about the risk of a product like zelle potentially cannibalizing some of your payments volume andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp what were focused on with zelle is just increasing the utilization of zelle across our customer base i think its a terrific product it has a lot of use cases were looking at different use cases but overall what were trying to do is just increase the utilization us bancorp usb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and then finally if i may i guess following up on the strengths youre seeing in the merchant acquiring side theres been this view among some fintech investors that elavon is a legacy player using legacy technology and losing share in merchant acquiring but nielsen published its market share stats for the top us merchant acquirers and it shows elavon actually moved up from number eight in to number seven based on dollar volume so from where you stand do you think the investments that youre making in talech and other digital initiatives could actually help you continue to gain share in the acquiring space or is it more effectively protecting your position andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp no we do think bill it can allow us to gain share i think its a combination of a number of things terry talked about the investments we made over the last three or four years our focus on techled initiatives and selling points differently than it was four or five years ago and then that combination of bringing banking together with merchant processing into a comprehensive product set we talked about talech and the dashboard i think all those things position us well for future growth both growth within the customer base that we have but also expanding and acquiring new customers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you for taking my questions andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator and
