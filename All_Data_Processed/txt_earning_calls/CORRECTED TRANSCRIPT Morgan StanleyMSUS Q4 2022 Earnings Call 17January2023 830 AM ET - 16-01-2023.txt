thank you operator good morning everyone thanks for joining us morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 the macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we havent seen for some time the combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to very little strategic activity in capital raising despite volatility throughout the year morgan stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered an rotce of including integrationrelated expenses from our deals the firm did what it was supposed to do with our most stable wealth and investment management businesses offsetting declines in institutional securities this is hard evidence of the transformation weve made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the rotce we had in the last notable challenging environment of when markets rebound we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm and from an even stronger position before turning to sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year ill walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals and our annual strategic update appropriately titled delivering sic driving growth through the next decade briefly first id like to acknowledge the many contributions jon pruzan made as cfo and coo as you know he is retiring from morgan stanley at the end of this month and we wish him the absolute best please now turn to the deck and to slide what informs our confidence in growth strategy is that we know who we are weve been clear about that for over a decade our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date and the next decade will be no different on slide you can see weve been consistent since the financial crisis we have a clientcentric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it we committed to our clients and to the markets were in clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have in each of our businesses we have a significant competitive moat which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength slide highlights the strategic decisions weve made over the past decade with a focus on aligning markets ourselves to the market where we perform best and these are core businesses with scale in major markets that are on the whole more balance sheet light and benefit from more durable feebased revenues we continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth we have a proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy namely within wealth and investment management importantly weve also taken action to get out of the businesses that are not core to this flow of capital while we may facilitate activities across varied markets we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit payments physical handling of commodities and the like instead we focus on markets we know best and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets please turn to slide this illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix as we continue to grow our client assets we expect wealth and investment management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firms pretax profit the stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise fair to say our business model was tested this year as you can see on slide as the paradigm shift with firstly the continuation of the first pandemic in years the first war in europe over years and the highest inflation in years despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar the firm performed well we generated as i said before a rotce had the the most excess riskbased capital of our peers and attracted over billion of net new assets all while integrating two major acquisitions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 so now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade lets start with wealth management on slide you can see we have leadership positions across channels reflecting our combination of bestinclass advice and bestinclass technology and we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey this allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provide the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels the growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues something ive been tracking for well over a decade every trading day saw revenues in excess of million and over onethird of those exceeded million a day contrast that with only three years ago where of trading revenues were each below million and none exceeded million the history of the journey is illustrated on slide wealth management has gone through a powerful transformation as you all know including with the most significant recent acquisitions of etrade and solium which have expanded our client base with two new channels today we have million relationships were focused on deepening those relationships by offering the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform from here were building on the scale and the tools to reach and the reach that will propel future growth net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion todate and you can see the driving forces highlighted on slide we have invested in expanding our bank offerings allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs weve nearly doubled our lending balances over the last three years and we expect to continue to grow attractive highquality loans on the other side our deposits franchise has grown significantly since and will continue to support future nii through various cycles approximately of our deposits are sourced from our wealth management client base and in the current rising rate environment our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate hiking cycle sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around nii further in a few minutes lets turn to slide this now talks about nna growth net new assets over the last three years our platform generated nearly trillion of net new assets showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking morgan stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator given the scale and reach of our businesses we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward obviously there will be ups and down in individual years but over a threeyear period we expect to drive approximately trillion in net new assets most importantly as you can see on the righthand side of this page no single source is accounting for greater than of this net new money some people think its just a result of recruiting it is absolutely not its a combination of several things which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money you can see on slide which shows our growth in client assets weve experienced that through our workplace channel we estimate now that relationships well held away has expanded by about four times in the last three years our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum were well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets further the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform weve executed on key steps to deepen those weve already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to of workplace participants and to achieve retention of stock plan assets we look forward to even higher retention morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 the results of our advisordriven strategy are illustrated on slide the workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at million relationships to date while it can take several years to deepen those weve already seen success in some parts of the offering that of our stock plan administrative services over the last three years weve had approximately billion of aftertax vested inflows vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience and thats allowed us to showcase the power of advice to date weve already seen advisorled flows of approximately billion that originated from a workplace relationship portion of those assets are the stock plan vested balances but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away in short as we deliver our full suite of capabilities our strategy to attract clients to advice is working investment management has also delivered strong feebased growth over the course of its own transformation as you can see on slide which encapsulates the business together with eaton vance this business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since and importantly this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified increased diversification from fixed income customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets we remain very aligned to key growth areas our alternatives investable capital is at billion with strong growth in private credit real assets including infrastructure our multistrategy hedge fund platform and special situations and customization by our market leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine shifting to institutional securities on slide we have a global and balanced franchise and our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active this has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments we remain a leader in equity and investment banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities on slide you can see our institutional business remains the top three global leader in the industry as demonstrated by a wallet share position we have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capitallight businesses at the same time weve shown prudence of our resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined rwa usage which actually dropped from to and our consistent gsib surcharge of lets move to our capital strategy on slide we have basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement this is intentional our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses and weve seen a steady decline in our scb excluding the dividend addon reflective of our more durable business mix our capital position gives us enormous flexibility and were comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned on slide sic you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders our business transformation especially the durable earnings from wealth and investment management enabled us to double our dividend and further increase it by in but at the same time weve reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions taken together we delivered a capital return to our shareholders last year we remain committed to ongoing shareholder return adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements demand shifting to how we see the future state on slide starting with the expected path to trillion in client assets across wealth and investment management weve demonstrated our ability to generate over the last three years morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 positive net new assets of approximately million a year combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead now lets consider this within the broader firm picture and bear with me for a minute in the firm delivered billion of pretax profit in this future scenario of trillion of assets which i believe will happen generating approximately basis points of revenue which is about what were doing currently and a pretax margin which is within of what were doing currently if you put that math together it should create of itself over billion of pretax income as you can see that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses so if you pull it all together just to wrap it up slide reiterates our confidence in our performance goals they have not changed on account of whats gone on in the markets in the last months these are the metrics we need to support our longer term objectives of note weve added a new goal that i spoke to earlier that weve talked about in the last six months to generate trillion in net new assets approximately every three years again im sure there will be volatility quarterby quarter yearbyyear but as weve demonstrated through the funnel of sources we expect an outcome over three years of approximately trillion thats about by the way to of beginning period assets within wealth and asset management as we approach we do so with client confidence recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our wealth and investment management businesses and our market share leading positions across much of institutional securities as always our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic political or regulatory environment however with a constructive outlook and a proven track record weve delivered thus far we fully expect to achieve our goals over time i will now turn the call over to sharon who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results and wed be delighted to take your questions sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning in a complex year the firm delivered solid results full year revenues were billion and pbt was billion the fourth quarter contributed to billion in revenues and pbt of billion the strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off wealth management had a record year and fixed income had its strongest performance in over a decade while the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty the business model performed very well in a challenging environment as it was designed to do the full year results included million of integrationrelated expenses of which million were incurred in the fourth quarter excluding these impacts eps was and for the full year and for the quarter respectively the full year rotce was and excluding the costs associated with integration in the quarter severance expenses of million related to december employee action and a net discrete tax benefit of million largely offset each other through net income morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 the full year efficiency ratio was excluding integrationrelated expenses our fullyear efficiency ratio was total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year lower compensation expenses principally related to movements in dcp and on lower revenues were offset by higher noncompensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend as a reminder this year also included a million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firms record keeping requirement in the second quarter as the environment evolved over the course of we actively managed our expense base cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty we continue to review efficiency opportunities we are in the final stages of completing our integration of both etrade and eaton vance and this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integrationrelated expenses from reported results however particularly as it relates to the integration of etrade the final backoffice integration remains scheduled to conclude in we expect to incur approximately million of additional integrationrelated expenses this year these expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately twothirds related to etrade and onethird related to eaton vance now to the businesses institutional securities full year revenues of billion declined from the record prior year in the fourth quarter revenues were billion overall quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first nine months of the year reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment weaker investment banking results persisted reflecting the challenging banking backdrop investment banking revenues were billion for the full year down from the record prior year advisory delivered its second best result supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transaction underwriting was more challenged in line with the broader market full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last years debt volumes contracted following the first quarter and while the market was receptive to higher quality issuance activity was limited to constructive market periods fourth quarter revenues of billion decreased from the prior year lower completed ma and underwriting market volumes weighed on results as we have highlighted in prior quarters client dialog and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions and looking ahead we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity equity full year revenues were billion representing another strong year of over billion and making us a global leader in this business revenues declined from the record prior year primarily driven by lower market activities revenues were billion in the quarter reflecting lower asset levels and volumes prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging cash results declined on lower client activity across the region derivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well last years fourth quarter also benefited from a marktomarket gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter fixed income revenues of billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade the divergence between the feds guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities quarterly revenues were billion macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated and clients morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 repositioned in rates and foreign exchange strength in macro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened driving an increase in client activity results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses other revenues included million of marktomarket losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges these losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of million turning to wealth management for the full year wealth management produced record revenues of billion and a record pretax profit of billion resulting in a pbt margin of excluding integrationrelated expenses of million the pbt margin was full year results reflect marktomarket impacts of our deferred cashbased compensation plans referred to as dcp this negatively impact our full year revenues by million with a corresponding decrease of million in compensation expenses as we have explained historically there is typically a timing difference between the marktomarket gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period the revenue and the expense impact of dcp is now included in our financial supplement fourth quarter revenues were a record of billion and the pbt margin was including integration related expenses of million the pbt margin was total client assets were trillion feebased flows were billion in the quarter and asset management revenues were billion net new assets of billion in the year represent a annual growth rate of beginning period assets fourth quarter net new assets were billion with contributions across channels transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were million including the impact of dcp transactional revenues declined from the prior year the decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products bank lending balances grew by billion in the year or and stand at billion the pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially while mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly this was offset by paydowns in securitiesbased lending due to the higher interest rate environment total deposits rose sequentially to billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our wealth management clients we have seen success with our strategy to provide advisors with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environment further the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter as a result we have a favorable deposit mix largely sourced from our wealth management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients needs net interest income was billion in the quarter the increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last months looking ahead we do not believe that nii has peaked we entered the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value while we expect the growth of nii to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately sequentially assuming the forward curve is realized morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 investment management reported full year revenues of billion declining from the prior year the challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds and also impacted our aum which declined to trillion fourth quarter revenues were billion longterm net outflows of billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income reflecting the challenging public market backdrop partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions particularly parametric customized portfolios as well as our special situation strategies and private credit fourth quarter asset management and related fees were billion declining on the back of lower average aum partially offset by higher liquidity revenues as a reminder performance fees are recognized on an annual basis largely in the fourth quarter which drove the increase versus the third quarter quarterly performancebased income and other revenues were million we saw broadbased gains in our private alternatives portfolio though lower than the prior year the diversification we gained from having fixed income parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle we continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand turning to the balance sheet ph total stat assets were trillion standardized rwas declined by billion sequentially to billion reflective of our prudent management of resources our standardized cet1 ratio was up basis points from the prior quarter solid earnings lower rwas and gains in ocis partially offset by capital actions contributed to our strong cet1 ratio we continue to execute our buyback program and we repurchased approximately billion of common stock in the quarter the full year tax rate was driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits we expect our tax rate to be approximately which will exhibit some quarterly volatility the firms results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment while there are of course uncertainties as we look ahead into we remain confident in the durability of the firm and the growth opportunities in the year ahead our combined trillion of assets across wealth and investment management provides us ballast importantly our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover finally while still very early in the year we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement weve seen so far with that we will now open the line to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 question and answer section operator we are now ready to taking questions operator instructions well go first to glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks so much i appreciate all the slides too okay two big picture questions i guess one james with the basis points of excess over your cet1 requirements and the big buffer served you well youve got a lot of buybacks but also its dilutive to returns and im just curious how you balance that of keeping that buffer or is that buffer more temporary weighting on basel iii endgame final results or is that something you want you plan on sitting at im just curious on your big picture resting spot for that excess capital james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure good morning glenn its a great question and its sort of pivotal to the whole strategic positioning of the firm because right now i think capital strategy is critical there are a few things going on firstly we have been able to reduce our peak to trough in ccar because of the change in mix in our business secondly because of the market environment weve reduced rwas just weve taken maybe a more prudent lean in and obviously we can reverse that at any point in time which eats up cet1 thirdly we have the basel iii finally looks like its coming to fruition at some point in the first half of the year although i dont expect that banks will be required to implement whatever the new capital rules are until the beginning of so while theres a pretty long timeframe a year is a long time in this business let alone a yearandahalf i still think that its prudent to kind of have some capital sitting there and just id rather be in a position where we have excess capital when particularly in an environment where we dont see obvious places weve put it to work now that said we did our best we bought back i think it was billion and billion last year we doubled the dividend the year before we increased the dividend last year obviously were i mean its fair to assume that were going to continue moving on capital distributions but i like a number of we actually we triggered a little higher than that this quarter we could easily drop down to that wouldnt bother me at all but that will be driven by the environment and business opportunities so great position to be in coming into a change in the regulatory outlook potentially and we can always act aggressively and weve proven we will do that when we have more clarity glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that one other big picture is so wealth managements growing great everybodys happy i think historically and even now youve been considered very equitycentric firm whether it be wealth and asset management or your dominant equities platform so curious if youre thinking about its possible with these higher rates lots of clients shift to a more defensive stance theres good income out there to be earned without morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 much risk or too much risk if we see a more material shift towards fixed income appetite in general do you think that in any way disadvantages morgan stanley as a firm and overall profitability james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i mean listen our share of fixed income is banking equities so obviously the fixed income pool grows by the way i shared a few years ago it was so the team ph under its head in sam kelliesmith has done a phenomenal job but if the pool grows faster in fixed income just arithmetically youre not going to do as well as if the pool grew faster in equities that doesnt bother me a whole lot i mean weve never tried to be the fxem shop weve never had the global rates trading fx trading macro businesses that some of the correspondentdriven commercial banks have ph had the hsbcs and citis and thats a business model just ph different so we just we dont have as big transaction services so were not going to have as much fx that said what the team have done in macro under jakob under credit and jay hallik in commodities is really impressive so im totally fine with that and we clearly have the product its not like we dont sell muni bonds to our clients and we dont have fixed income underwriting et cetera we have the product its just arithmetically given our share relative to the others we wouldnt grow as fast by the way i was happy to see i think equities was back at number one this quarter core franchise were really well positioned glenn im not bothered by that at all operator well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe first question just sharon following up on the efficiency ratio about for as we think about the journey from to something sub70 kind of in line with your strategic target give us a sense of what it needs is it just time and other businesses growing which are more efficient and that changes the mix or could we see that sub70 even over the next couple of years would love to hear in terms of both from a timing standpoint and what needs to happen at the firm to get to a sustainably below efficiency ratio sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so if you think about we were weve been below right so you look back to the last couple years and there are periods of time where we are below theres obviously two pieces to it both the expense side and the revenue side i think that as we continue to gain scale across the businesses each of those dollars that we put to work will be more and more efficient morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 as i highlighted where weve been investing a lot of those dollars is on the technology side i noted that in my prepared remarks and we have seen that both from the cyber resiliency side and also just as we think about the broader integrations of all of the platforms that weve acquired over the last couple years so as i think through it and i think about the timing obviously a different revenue environment will certainly help and theres tremendous operating leverage particularly as you think about the institutional securities business which will help to drive that now if you go through each of the businesses each of those businesses also exhibit operating leverage right if you have a constructive market environment weve seen very strong margins also from the investment management business were on our way to achieve the margin target as you relate to the wealth management business so id say its a balance of both both the revenue environment and how that turns around and then just continued discipline in making sure that we have the right investments as we think about our expense base going forward so weve been extremely prudent and disciplined as we think about the base over the last especially nine months that weve seen with this type of environment ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just a separate question around markets activity obviously highly uncertain how investment banking activity shakes out but if the fed were to pause and the central banks have done with the majority of the rate hikes is that enough to drive a rebound in ma ecm dcm or do we need a lot more in terms of just confidence returning to the market before we see ib activity picking up like what are you hearing from your clients sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure why dont i start and if james has anything to add i basically say that from if we think about the investment banking pipeline the pipeline itself isnt whats changed whats changed is that movement from the pipeline to realized and when we think about what will cause that that policy pivot a peak in inflation something that allows the ceos that are actually having those conversations in boardrooms to have more confidence both with their own economic outlook and or excuse me their own company outlook the economic outlook that hinges on that and then also just price clarity and valuation certainty those are the things that as you think through it we would expect to see move from the pipeline stage into the realized and announced stage so the macro environment that you laid out where there is more clarity on the economy and then also a reduction in volatility should help that move forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i would say i think sharon said right and i am highly confident that when the fed pauses deal activity and underwriting activity will go up i would bet the year on that in fact ceos job is to drive growth in their businesses and they do that two ways organic and inorganic and ive been doing this a long time and ive done both and the only tricky part about inorganic once youve got your strategy morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 set is timing and sometimes youve got to ignore timing but if the market is really volatile behoove ceos particularly those relatively early in their careers to be a little cautious and thats what were seeing that will change operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions and just id like to wish jon pruzan best of luck looking forward to watching his next chapter play out so sharon would love to double click on your expectations for nii hear you that its sort of based on the forward curve playing out and encouraging certainly to hear its not peaked but could you maybe give a little bit more color around expectations beyond forward curve what do you assume for deposit dynamics do you think that the decline in sweep balances will continue to decline whats underlying that thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so lets take a step back and just say why did we outperform in the fourth quarter brennan and if you think about that we obviously when we look at the liability side we outperformed there and we performed on the asset side so if we unpack a little bit of the liability side i take it into two pieces as you highlighted its obviously about the deposit mix and also about pricing so what weve seen in the deposit mix is that we have seen a moderation in the pace of outflows of those ph bdps obviously where we will go from here well need that to play out but that is something that we take out into account when we think about the first quarter guidance the second point is obviously on the actual liability pricing we did see an outperformance of that pricing and when we exit the first quarter we take that in exit excuse me the fourth quarter and take that into the first quarter thats a benefit as well so the fed hiking basis points over the fourth quarter and then being able to have disciplined pricing over the fourth quarter will serve us well in the first brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then certainly different question wealth management if we look at the client asset trends they were barely up quarteroverquarter basically total client assets in wealth were up about the equivalent of the net new assets and can clearly see that selfdirected and workplace were a little weak probably because their exposure more exposure to the ph qs and the more growthy stocks but i would think given what we saw in the markets that thered be a bit more of a tailwind to client assets was there anything unusual that was happening there sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley no actually and what you highlighted is broadly correct in terms of where you see the broader exposure the underlying exposure of those different channels so its just a function of the assets that you actually see as well as the mix of the underlying assets based on the channel morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 operator well go next to steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to dig in a little bit further sharon as it relates to brennans question on nii the two pieces i want to understand a little bit better is one what are you assuming for sbl growth in the coming year or even loan growth broadly across the wealth complex and secondly you saw really nice deposit growth in the fourth quarter wanted to understand how much of thats a function of tax loss harvesting that you expect to be redeployed or do you think any of that deposit growth is actually going to prove to be a bit stickier sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure im just going to take them ill take them in order the first is as you asked about loan growth the nii guidance in the first quarter is not dependent on the loan growth projections obviously the loan growth itself will be a function of the environment as i said from an sbl perspective we have seen some paydowns and it will be dependent on market conditions now the second question that you asked me around the deposits and the deposit growth obviously there are there could be a portion of it that does come from as you mentioned different inputs that you might see be that interest et cetera in the end of the fourth quarter but broadly speaking what weve seen with the deposit base is that we have many channels ie savings for example where we can begin to get those deposits and attract new deposits to the institution and to the bank from other sources external assets held away that come in and also as you think about every piece of nna that comes in over time the trillion that james mentioned theres generally a portion of that thats actually held from a cash perspective and so that i think also needs to be taken account when thinking about the build as you go forward from the deposit a longer term deposit perspective steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and just for my followup as it relates to the trading outlook i thought you guys did a really nice job of articulating some of the potential sources or drivers of inflection in investment banking activity admittedly weve experienced a couple of years of pretty gangbusters trading and market activity i was hoping to get your perspective on how youre thinking about the outlook for the trading businesses if youre willing to go so far as to suggest what normalization might look like across both ficc and equities would be really helpful sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i would look at it more holistically from an institutional perspective and so when i think about what does it mean we entered i remember doing an investor conference in february of last year and we talked a lot about morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 what is normal and is normal and our answer then was we would expect to actually normalize somewhere between and from an industry wallet perspective in fact it looks as though the industry wallet has just been right around that range within those two bounds and when we look ahead we would expect to remain above that level and well have to see what the upside is but a lot of that growth in sales trading has come from the divergent central bank policies and has also come from the fact that you have higher yields right so when you think about investing in the fixed income product and you go into that going forward that could create different dynamics than we would have seen over the earlier through or outlook for sales trading operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to follow up on the wealth business and the rollout of the companion accounts and the that youve highlighted can you talk about the behavior change or what has happened subsequent to clients receiving those companion accounts and try to get a sense of what that could mean on a longer term basis in terms of increased activity and asset flows sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely as james highlighted in his prepared remarks the intention is to generally be in a position where were able to offer the right type of advice and content and wealth advice over the course in time when we go into the workplace and so when we think about the retention of assets or we think about the companion account rollout eventually what thats really doing is to make sure that weve provided content we look at content as ive said before as a passport into the employees and you think about that as financial wellness something that jed highlighted in his presentation in the spring is generally speaking when you see of vested assets that come into the institution through the stock plan business we actually see approximately compared to that that come from assets held away thats the consolidation of assets once you have this advicebased channel and the advicebased relationship and so what were trying to do is build on that we have an fa referral process we continue to use technology to help match the right individuals with the right fas we have better relationship management within etrade and making sure that larger accounts are also connected appropriately to the right teams these are all ways to build the right advice for the right clients to provide them choice and give them a reason to bring assets held away into the institution daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you and then just as a followup you talked about the longerterm efficiency potential but i guess the thing about fourth quarter there was some severance looking at noncomp expense as you think about next year just want to understand how we should think about the base level of expenses and potential changes andor where youre looking to be more efficient into this year sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 sure i mean were always as i said in my prepared remarks looking at efficiency opportunities where they might exist as you highlight through the severance we just had a december employee action so we obviously walk in with a different level of comfort as we kind of think about the expense base going forward but as weve done with our own resources from a capital perspective well remain nimble and prudent and look forward if and as the economic environment changes james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i think just on the efficiency ratio its worth pointing out and sharon mentioned this earlier if you actually average the last two years and you end up right at was about was at part of its revenue driven we took the efficiency that will take some expenses out in the coming year we also want to feed the beast i mean were growing parts of this firm were trying to we dont were not of the view that were heading into a dark period whatever negativity in the world is out there thats not our house view so we want to make sure were positioned for growth this thing will turn ma underwriting will come back im positive of it so we want to be well positioned for it but were going to manage through that number of around as best as we can operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning i have a bigger picture james you gave us some very good detail about the expectations for growth in the wealth management and the new assets trillion every three years when you look at your three channels the advisorled workplace and selfdirected where do you see the most growth and which one has the best margin that can get you to that goal james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well the advisor is the biggest obviously by far we have advisors phenomenal business the direct channel is from the acquisition of etrade combined with our morgan stanley direct great business obviously its a little more market sensitive little more active particularly on the options side during bullish market environments and the workplace is sort of the sleeper ive said previously i think two years ago i thought in a decade wed look back at this firm and say that the workplace was the most significant strategic change happened over the last decade i truly believe that the workplace employee the retirement space is sort of the next frontier and were right in the middle of that so as to margins theyre probably margin accretive in reverse order in other words workplace first the direct second and the advisor third thats simply a function of ph advisors we have advisor payout and god bless them for the jobs that they do and were very happy to pay them so i think its a combination gerard of all three of them we will hit the margin i mean were almost there now in a more challenging environment so that i have zero anxiety about whether its this year or next year its coming and all of them will contribute gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 very good appreciate that and sharon you talked about the marks that you took in the corporate loan portfolio in the quarter just over million i think you said can you share with us how big is that portfolio and where did the marks come from were they bridge loans or what drove those marks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so you have different disclosures as it relates to various loans and lending commitments that we give as we think about that line its inclusive of losses across the loan portfolio and it was also worth highlighting there that we also mentioned the interest that you received on the loans that we hold as well as the fees associated with those loans operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey james last quarter i asked you when will you be ready for plan b if the pipeline doesnt seem like its going to be converted and you said youre at plan a minus so just kind of looking for an update there and in terms of the headwinds if i hear you correctly it sounds like the pipeline is still good but down quarter overquarter because some of those deals have converted and also you said its still not back yet and as it relates to the twitter financing you were the lead bank can you disclose any writedowns that you had on twitter or simply the leveraged loan category so thats the headwind on the other hand i guess theres been some reports that youve reduced head count so if you could just give us more color on that especially twitter james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley okay let me try and unpack that a little bit im not going to talk about twitter we dont talk about single names as you would expect you did see the line the other isg line you can assume that whatever marks we took on any single name are reflected in that and i think the the way i think about this is we run a portfolio business we obviously have single credits at any point in time that disappoint relative to others but its the total package and the total package if you look at it actually turned out to be very fine given the environment were in so on the plan b i dont know if the rip we did we took about heads in early december would equate to a plan b it certainly felt like it weve reduced we took a severance charge mike which affected some of the efficiency ratio for this year but well improve it for next year and that was the rightsizing we were frankly a little overdue we hadnt done anything for a couple of years weve had a lot of growth and well continue monitoring that obviously with the way bonus pools work we reflected the performance of the firm in the bonus pool so were not very different from the rest of the world in that regard and that obviously resets comp a little bit so i feel good about where the whole package is im actually as i said earlier alluded to im a little more confident about the long mediumterm outlook for the market im not talking about the first quarter or two although sharon said the first quarter has actually started well but the mediumterm outlook for the markets i see the fed has moved from basis points to basis points likely to go to basis points the next stop on the train line is zero and then eventually theyll start cutting not sure theyre going to cut this year but i think therell be zero increases this year for sure so thats the inflection point and theres a lot of money sitting around waiting to be put to work and thats our job is to be the flow of capital between those who have it and those who morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2023 need it so im pretty confident actually about the outlook so were weve done our plan b i guess were not anticipating a plan c and were going to watch and wait for a little while but i feel pretty good about it operator well take our last question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning i was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the flows within investment management both the long term and liquidity and how youre thinking about the outlook there specifically in the long term thank you sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure absolutely the long term obviously what we saw over the course of this year was some movements in equities that was the most notable that obviously had to do with some of the higher growth specific specific funds that we have there but i think you have to really think about those long terms from a longterm basis right so youre just focusing on this year but there were many many years of very strong flows into that business whats important is actually the diversification that we had because of eaton vance where we have other products that we were able to offset some of the outflows in say the equity product for example so parametric is one where we continue to see inflows throughout even the course of this year were really focused on the secular growth trends sustainability alternatives and customization more broadly those are the things that we think as we move forward will be positive for those line items
