our company our clients our shareholders and our team quarterly and annual revenue reached record levels from organic growth generated by all three of our business lines the strength of our business

grew organically by in which each of commercial and industrial commercial real estate and private banking loan balances growing to alltime highs they propelled us wellbeyond our billion asset target for lending was fully funded by deposit growth more than during the year and our loan deposit ratio remained under for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to add critical mass through responsible organic growth we further enhanced the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to invest in our business for the benefit of all our stakeholders at chartwell investment partners client assets under management expanded during both the quarter and the year to billion as we engaged with new and existing clients benefit from our managers strong investment performance tristate capital drove record net interest income and noninterest income growth pushing total revenue up from the prior year our organic top line growth also continued to outpace expenses even as we strategically invest in our business pretax income grew at a doubledigit pace of in and gaap earnings per share grew by to for the year as noted in our earnings release these results were impacted by approximately per share in expenses which were associated with advanced duediligence on an investment management acquisition candidate these conversations concluded before definitive agreement was reached we remain fully committed to our previously disclosed strategy to grow chartwell through a combination of organic and acquired means we will continue to actively evaluate potential candidates for acquisition and importantly will only consider those which meet all of our criteria including cultural compatibility credible investment performance complementary investment products and immediate earnings per share accretion in the meantime chartwell continues to contribute at least to tristate capitals total revenue with investment management fees comprising of noninterest income last year through the end of the fourth quarter chartwells active investment strategies also continued to deliver superior performance of its products outperformed their respective benchmarks for the one year period were ahead for threeyear performance and were ahead for fiveyear performance this track record along with our unique product offering and outstanding distribution capability is attracting new business tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 during the fourth quarter chartwell recorded new business and new flows from existing accounts of approximately million which along with market appreciation of million more than offset outflows as a result chartwell grew assets under management by nearly to billion last year outpacing publiclytraded traditional asset managers in the us which reported median organic assets under management growth of about the pipeline continues to be healthy as its ever been and we look forward to continuing to convert this pipeline into assets under management through turning to chartwells revenues in investment fees of just over million simply did not meet our organic growth goal but longerterm we believe we have the investment management talent sales and distribution capability and infrastructure to achieve top line growth thats aligned with our expectations in the meantime were mindful of the need to balance investing in chartwells future growth with expense discipline this business has been quite profitable since our entry into this space in and in we began taking active measures to measurably and meaningfully enhance chartwells contributions to earnings chartwell lowered segment expenses by more than in from the year before excluding acquisition related costs in addition segment compensation and benefit expenses were lowered by more than in overall by the end of last year chartwell had reduced its annual expense run rate by more than million which will be more fully reflected in the results at tristate capital bank our commercial business continues to thrive middlemarket commercial loan balances approach billion at the yearend an increase of from one year prior and annualized from september period end commercial and industrial loans surpassed a billion for the first time at the end of growing by last year commercial real estate loans totaled billion increasing in even with this impressive performance as a percentage of total loans cre lending declined to at yearend origination activity was very strong during the fourth quarter with about million from ci and about million from commercial real estate as you saw from our average balance sheet much of our fourth quarter production took place in december in addition the impact of declining interest rates related to the fed funds target rate cuts in late september and october are reflected in our fourth quarter results given the timing of production and the more stable current interest rate environment we expect the full benefit of our record fourth quarter loan growth to be realized and net interest income in we remain very wellpositioned to continue our commercial banking success in the current environment were encouraged by our ci and cre pipelines and we expect to continue to deliver strong commercial loan growth during our private banking business achieved exceptional results with the portfolio growing by we are the nations premier provider of marketable securitiesbased lending with tristate capital private banking loans offered through our expanding network of financial intermediary firms and over individual advisors weve made this strategic investment in people technology and client experience to secure our market position and we continue to build the relationships with new individual advisors to our network we now have a business development team of about individuals dedicated to growing the national private banking business by the end of we are working with more than individual advisors and trust officers with about doing multiple transactions for their clients on our platform last year turning briefly to cecl and its implementation this year while there are many factors in how it applies to our business there are two id mention in particular the first is that well over half of our loans are in tristate capitals tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 portfolio of private banking loans collateralized by marketable securities its sum this portfolio has favorable treatment under regulatory capital requirements and current alll methodology similarly cecl will not require a reserve for credit loss in this portfolio going forward the second factor is our rate and level of new loan production and growth in the commercial part of our lending business the calculations for provision amounts under cecl are much more impacted by new loan production and growth than the preexisting alll methodology in addition while our ci lending has picked up pace our commercial real estate lending continues to be a significant source of growth we expect to continue our history of doubledigit loan growth in these businesses with a continued focus on strong asset quality overall our current efforts at implementing cecl lead us to anticipate that our total allowance will be between basis points and basis points of total loans outstanding provision expenses expected to be between million and million for the year separately we expect a tax rate between and our national deposit franchise has been successful in keeping pace with our exceptional loan growth deposits grew organically by nearly billion last year through engagement of new and existing clients in diversified channels overall we continue to maintain flexibility and pricing deposits as evidenced by our approving funding costs in the first quarter in the fourth quarter our total cost of funds for all deposits and interest bearing liabilities averaged in the fourth quarter a basis point improvement from the linked third quarter borrowers swap fee income continued to be healthy in the final quarter totaling some million and bringing swap fees to a million as we continue to grow the population of clients who want access to this product to partner with their term loan facilities as you know this type of activity is largely driven by the rate environment however it continues to strengthen as we integrated more indelibly into our growing lending business in of swap fees came from private banking clients compared to of the year before after we invested very effectively in the offering capability and client experience in we have built this company to last through a strategy of responsible growth emphasizing client focus discipline soundness and profitability under the guidance of an experienced leadership team and board of directors we are pleased to announce that a new independent director audrey dunning joined the tristate capital board last week audrey is the founder and ceo of amp growth advisors and she has spent much of her career focused on information technology and digital transformation consulting audrey currently sits on the board of directors for the pittsburgh branch of the federal reserve bank of cleveland and also has past bank board experience tristate capital will surely benefit from her experience and counsel we are highly motivated by the opportunities we see ahead and encouraged by the performance were building in we focus on the following goals growing total revenue at a doubledigit pace over growing pretax income at a doubledigit pace growing loans at a doubledigit pace of to growing total deposits at a doubledigit pace of to growing chartwell gross client inflows by or more from 2019s billion improving chartwells adjusted ebitda margin by at least basis points from last years excluding acquisition related expenses maintaining chartwells strong investment performance relative to benchmarks and maintaining strong asset quality metrics these goals are based totally on organic growth and do not take into account the contributions of any investment management acquisition we may undertake based on our pipeline position in each of the markets we serve the talent and an infrastructure we have in place today and our continued focus on responsible investments and expense discipline tristate capital is very well positioned for strong and profitable growth in and beyond tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 operator that concludes my remarks would you please open the lines question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions please limit yourself to one question and one followup if you have further questions you may reenter the question queue the first question comes from michael perito of kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys happy new year james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning michael happy new year to you michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so a couple questions one just on the loan growth expectations for and deposits as well to obviously a fairly wide range i know historically youve always said the way to kind of think about is a ph cagr but it would seem like recent performance would at least make us think that well have to rethink that a little bit nearterm and i was just wondering if you could discuss kind of where the pipelines are and maybe what some of the things that will occur in if you to be at either end of that range that you provided versus the when thinking about loan and deposit growth james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc mike we wanted to provide you with a reasonable guideline based on our assessment of the marketplace we obviously had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter i wish i could say were we could guarantee or we could replicate that on a consistent basis as youre probably aware the second and fourth quarter are normally our strongest quarters if you look at our business in general and so what we wanted to do is to give a broad spectrum i would tell you everyone sitting around the table here with me would be disappointed if we had growth in these particular markets so i would say from a longer term forecast i would fully expect next year that wed be seeing over of this loan portfolio being in the private banking category and i believe that youll continue to see the commercial real estate grow but itll stay in the range of or maybe slightly less than that and the rest will be the commercial and industrial loans so we expect that were going to have a very strong year as we look at our middle market place we see the companies with fairly strong cash cash flow and we see their inventories relatively low and as we look at private banking weve really broaden our distribution network and we are into a lot more opportunities at this point and we see that continuing to grow at the pace of the to range michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 thats very helpful jim thank you and then just secondly if i just wanted to confirm and ask a followup on cecl so if i heard you correctly jim so you will no longer be carrying a reserve against the private banking loans under once you adapt cecl is that correct david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc mike there is no requirement to it as you know weve talked about the regulatory requirements under basel iii and jim mentioned alll methodology is the current methodology under cecl there is a provision called the practical expedient which also applies to these types of loans so we are not required to carry any capital against those loans however we do put basis points against those loans just out of ph under precaution so there will be michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so even once you adopt you cecl you guys and i know there is a loss ratio and collateralize and i dont think the reserve is all of that significant of the number today but yield still be pretty something against these loans even if its modest amount even though you dont have to once you adopt cecl david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc exactly yes michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay operator the next question is from steve moss of b riley please go ahead steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc i just wanted to start on acquisition front what do you think jim the potential for clean acquisitions this year james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc i communicated to you last year that ive felt very strongly we could get a get one done in i feel just strong were disappointed that what we had worked on did not come to fruition and tim riddle who is the ceo of our money management firm and i spent a consequential amount on it we obviously also spent a meaningful amount of money on it but at the end weve recognized that it that particular situation would not work for us and walked away i would tell you steve that the market there is an awful lot of properties on the market at this particular time weve been looking at multiple ones and we have a couple that were looking at very closely right now so the opportunities are there its just a question of finding the right opportunity so im optimistic but also disappointed that we wont be able to complete the acquisition that weve looked at but we walked away for the right reasons steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 okay thats helpful and then my followup here is just on capital obviously still plenty of capital to support growth but given the growth in the acquisition dynamic just kind of wondering what are your thoughts are in potential needs david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc steve good morning we have the necessary liquidity in capital to pull off an acquisition without needing to go to the capital markets so theres no imminent need to do so but well continue to monitor closely as we move through the year and as we as the acquisition targets present themselves steve moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay thank you very much operator operator instructions the next question is from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good morning guys james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning matt david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning matt matt olney q analyst stephens inc want to focus on the outlook for operating expenses and the growth behind that perhaps you gave us some guidance on that in the prepared remarks i just missed it but just give us some commentary about your expectations for expense growth in david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc sure matt you didnt miss it we didnt provide guidance i dont believe but were going to continue to make the necessary investments as we always have and people process in technology to drive growth in the business were very focused on driving operating leverage growth yearoveryear as we sit here today ill tell you that the bank efficiency ratio will probably come in somewhere around to for were going to work hard to come in under that range but thats our most likely scenario at this point matt olney q analyst stephens inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 got it okay thats helpful and then as a followup im curious about your expectation on the loan yields in the near term and im looking for just a general update on pricing that youre seeing through your various major products private banking cre and ci and obviously trying to appreciate if the fed kind of stays put here kind of what type of inflection were going to see on the loan yield side thanks david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so loan pricing assuming no fed changes this year so a stable market were protecting the commercial and industrial loans will priced at libor plus to over libor cre commercial real estate will price at libor plus to and private banking will be libor plus to matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful thank you operator the next question is from ryan griffin of da davidson please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning guys this is russell gunther how are you james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning russell david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co i wanted a quick followup on the expense question just asked and david i appreciate the comment in the bank efficiency i wonder though if you could comment youve also started off this from an average asset perspective as well as the core expense growth percentage perspective and was hopefully you could share your related thoughts on those metrics as well david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah so russell we dont as you know weve talked about it we dont really focus on expense to average assets thats somewhere between and depending upon the quarter and the year we are focused on driving operating leverage we couldnt go out there last year to keep the expense growth at or less we almost did it we would have that had we not had the acquisition related expenses onetime expenses and so were targeting something around or slightly below that again this year and thats i think weve got a reasonable chance of hitting that tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co all right appreciate it david and then for my second question guys thanks for the color on expectations for where loan yields are expected to reprice i would be interested in your thoughts around the liability side of the balance sheet as well continued traction within the treasury management deposit product and your ability to lower deals or our cost of funds james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah i think russell to give you the right perspective on it i think we would give you some colors we see it on the quarter that we just came out of because we could not be more pleased of how this company responded and what i would consider somewhat of a challenged environment with the loan portfolio thats wellpositioned to avoid interest rate risk and what you saw and i think this quarter that were in right now will be a much more robust quarter from an earnings standpoint for us as long as the interest rates remain relatively stable and what i believe you saw in the second quarter or the fourth quarter was the real power of our distribution system the numbers were truly volume driven and you clearly see the full you wont see the full impact until the first quarter is complete but think of whats reflected here you had nii of quarter over quarter despite a basis point compression in the nim you had continued strong swap fee income you had lower taxes that were driven by historical tax credits that were originated by our commercial real estate bankers who put on loans these the loans that they put on it put off the historical tax credit so all had what will be a very strong cash flow we had a broadbased world class loan growth and even if you look at chartwell the assets under management growth outpaced the market places i noted in the presentation and we were able to sustain the prior quarters revenue and improve the bottom line while we had negative cash flows from the berwyn income fund which is our highest priced product and the growth essentially offset much of the margin compression and i note that our cost of funds dropped by basis points and we had robust deposit growth so this franchise is now wellestablished its functioning in all cylinders and i think this quarter really reflects probably one of the more difficult quarters that weve had in that regard and the company continue to grow pretty handily and showed what its power is and i think youre going to see it even more reflected in the quarter that were in right now russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co very good jim david thank you both operator the next question is a followup from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah just want to circle back on the whole loan yield discussion david and if i look at those ranges you gave me to your various major products and i apply that to the pricing of your more recent loan mix im showing that loan yields should be very close to inflecting here and thats assuming libor is unchanged which is obviously a important variable but am i thinking about that right that loan yield should be very close to stabilizing and even inflecting here over the next quarter or two tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah i think thats right matt we dont spend a lot of time talking about nim youve heard us and why we dont do that but if you just focus on nim for a second jim talked about being able to drive meaningful deposit cost reduction overall for the year we drove basis points of cost reduction there and net interest margin for was for the year on average it was on average for the fourth quarter given the backdrop of a flat fed environment and then assuming the relationship between libor and eff continues to hold it to basis points we see nim at about this year so youre right were reaching that point matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats helpful and then more of a modeling question for you david i guess obviously the loan growth will drive the size of the balance sheet but for securities and for liquidity balances how should we be thinking about forecasting this i think both of those are around of average earning assets is that a reasonable expectation that those should remain each around of average earning asset as you grow the loan book in david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc they will i would say to we have been holding cash because we didnt have like the rate environment but as we grow this bank we need to continue to grow on balance sheet liquidity and so weve been very focused on the investment book early this year weve made some purchases here in the first quarter and you will see us continue to build that book the investment book over the course of the year matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay great thats all for me thank you guys operator the next question is from bill dezellem of tieton capital management please go ahead bill dezellem q analyst tieton capital management yeah thank you thats tieton capital but would you please discuss the roughly million jump in the adverse credits and what led to that james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah ill be more than glad to go over that with you bill what the challenge that we have is our adverse rating credits are very very low for a billion bank so anytime you have any type of modification itll be a most noted but let me point out what drove that and we also should give you a sense of whats going on within the context of that portfolio it was essentially two loans both secured by real estate one of them is a little over million loan thats secured by real estate and the assignment of an endowment fund and the other one and these were both rated credits and now they are rated there were special mention they are not substandard credits and the other one is a real estate loan million and its sole bank deal were the only party involved and its secured by real estate both these are paying as agreed i can point out to you that we dont have a single commercial loan thats not paying as agreed but i also would like to point out to you that during this quarter tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 30jan2020 which you didnt see substandard loans decreased million so our substandard loans are now million our nonperforming loans remained at just oreo remained exactly the same no change and our nonperforming assets were not changed for the quarter either bill dezellem q analyst tieton capital management great thank you and then do we understand correctly that under cecl and the provision will move up to something in the neighborhood of million per quarter versus your this quarter so essentially a rounding there david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc bill yeah so what jim mentioned is million to million of provision this year under cecl is what were thinking at the moment thats our best best view of how the year will play out and its obviously going to change as the loans build over the course of the quarter and as we continue to move through the year but thats our estimate at this point operator the next question is a followup from russell gunther of da davidson please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co yeah thanks guys for the followup on the cecl front as well do you guys have an estimated day impact that well see in the first quarter david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah russell were still fine tuning some of the data and running some back tests and so were not going to put out a number just yet but its going to be very modest relative to capital it will not be were not anticipating itll be a material impact russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co okay great that was it for me thanks david operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jim getz for closing remarks james f getz chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you very much for your continued interest in tristate capital and your participation today we look forward to updating you on our first quarter results in april have a good day operator the conference is now concluded thank
