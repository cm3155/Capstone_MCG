john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right thank you will good morning everybody thank you for making time to join us in march we passed the third anniversary of the pandemic shutdown of the economy it also marked the third anniversary of the feds massive quantitative easing response last year however the fed made a hard pivot from fighting the pandemic economy to fighting the inflation economy and intuitively weve all been worried that the speed and scale of that pivot would result in casualties well those casualties showed up in the banking system on march in spite of the recent turmoil the southstate team delivered results that were right in line with our previous guidance during the quarter we produced growth in loans deposits liquidity and our capital ratios earnings per share of increased from the same period last year that yielded a return on tangible common equity of about in the weeks following march the market identified two immediate risks liquidity and capital and also two longerterm risks earnings and credit ill briefly touch on each on liquidity weve been building a diversified and granular deposit base for decades and we came into this rate hiking cycle with billion in cash a year ago southstate manages million deposit accounts with an average deposit size that is the lowest of our peer group at only per account so that granularity adds stability and a lower percentage of uninsured deposits on page weve itemized billion of available liquidity sources to cover less than billion of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits and that provides coverage ratio so theres ample liquidity on capital in the weeks following march theres been speculation about the regulatory response and whether unrealized losses will eventually be reflected in regulatory capital ratios on page we show a waterfall to illustrate that southstate remains wellcapitalized on all regulatory ratios if you include the impact of aoci additionally we calculated it to include the impact of both availableforsale securities and heldtomaturity securities and all of our regulatory ratios still exceed wellcapitalized requirements those capital ratios should continue to build as the balance sheet grows at a more moderate pace in fact tangible book value per share increased during the first quarter on earnings like most banks the biggest risks to our earnings forecast are deposit costs we finished the first quarter with a cumulative deposit beta of only and a total cost of deposits of basis points which came in right inline with our prior guidance and that low beta helped our ppnr per share to grow over the last year given the events on march that earnings growth ramp will moderate and steve can share some updated thoughts in the qa on potential deposit betas moving forward and finally on credit asset quality metrics remain excellent and stable however we are conservatively building reserves over the last four quarters we added million in loan loss reserves compared to just million in chargeoffs and with the increasing focus on the office segment we added a new slide in the deck that will can touch on in his remarks south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 stepping back from current events every shakeup like this presents new challenges and new opportunities and this management team has been involved in nine fdic transactions and knows what its like to manage through a cycle thats why our guiding principles of soundness profitability and growth start with soundness we will continue to have opportunities to recruit new bankers and were already seeing opportunities to command higher loan spreads as industry liquidity is becoming scarce and it doesnt hurt to be located in the most vibrant markets in the country the southeast is known for its friendly business climate and capital flows where capital is treated well it seems like every month there is an announcement of a new multibillion dollar manufacturing facility with thousands of new jobs in the southeast and those job opportunities are leading to population migration based on the latest census report southstate operates in four of the six fastest growing states in the country ill conclude my remarks by thanking our team you can never predict when a black swan event will occur but those are the times when longterm client relationships matter the most and southstates relationships run long and deep and now ill turn it over to will to walk you through details on the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks john ill speak briefly to a few measures before we open it up for questions from a high level perspective our first quarter margin and deposit costs were at or slightly better than our prior guidance after the events of march we decided to build a bit more liquidity on the balance sheet our tax equivalent nim of was down basis points from the fourth quarter although it was approximately to basis points better than we had budgeted a 40basispoint increase in earning asset yields was offset by a 46basispoint increase in cost of funds cost of total deposits increased basis points in line with our guidance of a to basis point increase from last quarter our interestbearing deposit costs remained slightly below at basis points loans grew at a annualized rate in line with our expectations predominantly in single family residential up almost million line of credit utilization remained flat with ci line usage actually down from q4 and heloc usage flat deposits grew at a rate included in that deposit growth is brokered cd issuance of billion during the quarter we had budgeted and planned to issue billion but went ahead and issued an additional million late in the quarter in light of some of the industry concern excluding brokered cds our deposits declined approximately billion in the quarter of that amount approximately million was normal public funds drawdowns after q4 tax collection season we did see continued growth in the number of core banking deposit accounts debit cards and customers in the quarter we had million in fhlb borrowings outstanding as we elected to carry more cash on the balance sheet at quarter end with cash and fed funds balances up million south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 noninterest income improved million over the fourth quarter led by correspondent and mortgage and steady performance and in wealth management noninterest expenses continue to be well managed with nie of million up million from the fourth quarter and slightly better than expected for the quarter we had another quarter of very low credit losses with net loan recoveries excluding overdraft losses and only million in total net chargeoffs we added to the reserve levels again this quarter with a million provision expense million of which was for unfunded commitments the combined total of our allowance and reserve for unfunded commitments stood at million at the end of the quarter up basis points to as john noted thats million in provision expense versus only million in net chargeoffs over the last four quarters with net loan recoveries before including overdraft charge offs and we expanded our reserve coverage by basis points over this period slide shows asset quality trends over the last five quarters these metrics continue to be very solid npls to loans of basis points were up slightly from q4 and down slightly from the first quarter npas were up million and criticized and classified assets were essentially flat with substandard loans down million and special mention loans up million past dues were also down given the current interest in office cre ill mention a few highlights with respect to that portfolio as noted on slide office cre represents approximately of our outstanding loans and of this portfolio is inmarket the portfolio is very granular with an average loan size of less than million and the vast majority of the properties are smaller than square feet and not located in a central business district our weighted average debt service coverage is times and our weighted average loan to value is credit metrics on this portfolio are also strong with very low levels of delinquencies and only basis point on nonaccrual additionally weve added some disclosures again on slide covering deposits liquidity and capital our capital position continues to be strong and as john noted would remain so if regulatory ratios were changed to include aoci allinall while the last month of the quarter was rather tumultuous for our industry we believe were well positioned with a strong capital base granular deposit funding continued strong revenue and solid credit metrics operator well now take questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from catherine mealor of kbw catherine your line is open please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible you keep steve up for the deposit beta question so i thought id start there and just wanted to get your thoughts steve on how youre thinking about the acceleration in deposit betas over the next couple of quarters stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah catherine this is steve good to talk to you and of course john throws me the softball so here i go let me indiscernible so let me just kind of first of all just talk to the deposit beta obviously let me kind of put it in context of margin in general and this may be a little longer winded than you want but i think it kind of describes the overall perspective john and will both mentioned we had a really good nim in the first quarter our guidance was somewhere for the year between and deposit costs were within our guidance which we were really excited about as we talk to you about margin im going to give you the same guidance for with a few updates in the assumptions and just with the caveat when the industry experienced towards the 1st of march it really changed our thinking around how much liquidity to hold as well as our customers desire for more rate sensitive products so as we think about the three assumptions those three assumptions havent changed number one its the size of our interestearning assets number two the assumption of interest rates and then number three is the deposit beta question you asked so first around interestearning assets in january we talked about on the call our guidance of an average billion interestearning asset base in and we have no change to that two we talked about interest rates and in january the moodys consensus forecast was for fed funds to move up to and then be lowered basis points by the fourth quarter of this year but based on the new moodys baseline forecast we expect fed funds to peak at here in about a week and then stay there all the way through south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 so on page our graph shows our cycletodate beta is at versus our historical beta at in the last cycle as a result of the banking industry turmoil in march we are estimating that our deposit beta will rise or our deposit costs will rise to basis points in the second quarter bringing our cycletodate deposit beta into the low versus our historical if the fed stops raising rates in the second quarter based on history wed expect deposit costs to continue to move up at a much more gradual pace in the back half of the year this could cause full cycle data to increase a few percentage points to be honest and humble about the whole answer is we dont really know its been a unusual change in march but having said all that were confident in our deposit base and it seems to be doing well with all those new assumptions around interest rates and timing of deposit betas wed expect our fullyear nim to stabilize in the to range into so just one last point if over the next two years moodys baseline is correct and fed funds falls into the low with a slightly upward sloping yield curve the environment is very favorable for us as our interestsensitive deposit rates will be lowered while our assets ph that are adjustable and fixed will still reprice higher our deposit franchise continue to perform and provide a real stable margin environment but really net interest income driven not by margin but by growth in interestearning assets thats a longwinded answer but hopefully that gives you context john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp well deposit beta was in there somewhere indiscernible catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great no that was awesome as it always is thank you its very helpful so ph maybe few followup to that so on your average earning asset comment that the size is the same at billion is there a shift within that where we have a little more cash maybe less loans with a more moderate loan growth outlook stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp thats right i think were back to the john mentioned the four things that everybody talked about on march liquidity credit capital and earnings were probably going to carry a little bit more liquidity just through this time just prudently john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp but id say catherine not any dramatically bigger liquidity position i think early on we all were trying to figure out what was needed in light of all the uncertainty and we all spent a lot of time increasing on our contingent liquidity sources and weve got a slide on that in the deck and ill say were continuing to do that postquarter end and increased it further from there and so having access to the liquidity is important but i wouldnt say were going to dramatically increase the size of balance sheet liquidity on balance sheet by big numbers south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then back to the deposit conversation so there were seeing a lot of remix out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing across the industry so with your deposit beta guide and youre giving a total deposit beta thats going to include that remix how much of shift do you expect to continue to see out of noninterestbearing within that guide stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah kind of when we look back at history our dda is today is of our total deposits prepandemic it was in the high so you know im not sure that its going to go all the way back there but you kind of have to assume that its going to continue to drift but we dont know i would imagine that we would track pretty much the industry however thats going to play out catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and i think one other thought around that is i do think its around business deposits and of course as we talked about on this call times is we have a pretty granular deposit base thats sort of between retail small business and commercial and we have that slide that shows the granularity of each really the remix is primarily in the commercial space and not in small business and retail and thats been pretty steady catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah maybe just one followup just on that point is are you what kind of behavior have you seen i agree i think that deposit betas have mostly been driven in the commercial side really across the industry but as you look at your small business and retail piece did you see any change in behavior pick up especially after the march volatility stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp i think it probably woke the entire customer base up just around excess deposits so there was some excess deposits that were sitting in checking but really primarily if you looked at it from march on it was really more of a business remix than it really was any retail or small business and then within business there was more volatility with nonprofits or folks who are managing other peoples money they were a little bit more sensitive to the issues on march john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp can i give you an interesting statistic we had our call center volume at two weeks following march was a normal total volume it was and something calls and only calls having to do with fdic insurance coverage so basis points of the calls which surprised me how little call center activity we had around that subject south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc for sure thats interesting i agree well thats all very helpful ill hop back into queue thanks so much john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp all right thanks catherine operator thank you our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson kevin your line is open please proceed kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co i was just looking to drill down a little more into the comments about slowing balance sheet growth so from what i remember i dont think you guys had were guiding to rapid growth i think you had last said midsingledigit and so if were going even slower than that maybe just help us with does that happen quickly does that happen steadily over the course of the year and is that more driven by the demand and what the fed has done the feds getting what it wants in the economy or is it more you guys really proactively tapping on the brakes just given the economic cost of funding alone the credit concerns etcetera thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah kevin its john i think our previous guide for was that we would have midsingledigit loan growth for the year we came in at in the first quarter i can imagine that that loan growth may be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year and things would maybe slow down in the back half of the year as you have a lack of liquidity in the system and just price discovery between buyers and sellers so from our ci borrower standpoint i think that business is still good but a lot of them are kind of in a waitand see mode before they make major capital expenditures the ma activity slowed down in ci cre has slowed significantly and were seeing some of our peer banks back out of that space and so we want to be selective there multifamily is still strong because a lot of folks are still priced out of the single family market and weve got a lot of population migration here and industrial demand is still real strong near the ports particularly weve got less than vacancy rates in savannah and charleston on industrial south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 so i just i think theres a lag effect kevin with the fed interest rate increases we were growing loans in the midteens in in in the first quarter i still think the midsingle digits for the full year feels about right kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay great and maybe just a quick check on expenses i know i think last quarter you told us about a million run rate for the year and now were i think you said expenses came in a little better than your expectations at least is that still the outlook or given that things are getting tougher on the top line is there going to be more scrutiny on the expense line thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah kevin its will hopefully were always applying the appropriate level of scrutiny to our nie base and everybody applying that ownership culture as they think through their nie base i did reference we were a little better than target i think we had in the first quarter maybe budgeted about million more still pretty much on top of it we still think the million is a good number obviously in an environment like this though you do rethink do we need to necessarily make this higher or that higher that we may have had approved in the budget is that something we can hold off on and make sure that we need to do it those kind of decisions that hopefully our team of owners will think through that way there are factors that are harder to predict one is loan production volume and the impact that has on the capitalization of loan origination costs which is an offset nie so lower production leads to lower cost offset in that regard or higher nie but sitting here through the first quarter im pleased were a little bit ahead of budget on nie i still think our guidance for the full year feels about right at this point john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah and just what i would add to that kevin is just big picture is that were continuing to work on our platforms and spend money on those to make sure that weve got a really good customer employee experience and we think that thats going to pay dividends out in and so to wills point were always trying to manage expenses to the lowest common denominator and ultimately create and then therell always be opportunities again in environments like this where therell be teams of people and other things that well have the opportunity to hire and you want to have the ability to do that but i think within all that were going to manage the expense base william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and one other point ill make too just as youre thinking about modeling our typical most of our employees annual increase cycle is a july increase so youll see thats a third quarter event every year kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate that and then steve one thing i just it was a nice rebound quarter for correspondent just wondering if thats a sustainable pace or how we should think about that one south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp to your point correspondent had a great quarter this quarter kind of the way that we think about that business is obviously the interest rate swap revenues had a really good quarter fixed income is difficult right now just because of the way the yield curves shaped and cash indiscernible balance sheet but the way i kind of describe it is until the feds done hiking rates and we get some stability which should come in the next maybe toward the back half of the year these interest sensitive businesses like mortgage and correspondent probably will stay lower so i wouldnt expect i mean the first quarter is really good and i would kind of go back to our original guide on that to be in that to basis points of assets until the noninterest income ph to be that until the fed stops raising rates and then we kind of go to to basis points after that because we just need some stability for those businesses kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co got it thanks very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from stephen scouten of piper sandler stephen your line is open please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah good morning everyone i guess i was kind of curious at a high level how do you think if in any way your business model has kind of changed with all the turmoil from march and beyond everybody seems to think oh regional banking model is somehow dead now im just kind of curious what your views are on that at a high level and how you think your business model may or may not have changed john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah stephen its john i think about our business model and a couple of things come to mind number one is the local market leadership in our business model we have regional presidents and they manage their own balance sheet and their own income statement and i think that has proved to be very valuable when it comes to managing deposit cost and deposit betas in a headquartercentric type of business model youre making all of these interest rate decisions at the headquarters and i think its much much better for the local market leaders to figure out where they need to shoot the bullets on pricing deposits for their very best customers rather than someone guessing hundreds of miles away so i think that part of our model has been very very valuable the other piece of the model is its a diversified model you heard steve talk about the diversity of the deposit base onethird retail onethird small business onethird commercial treasury and you go back to what got the banks in trouble it was concentration on the loan portfolio you look at this cycle what got banks in trouble was concentration on the deposit side south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 so i think our decentralized leadership model is proving to be very valuable and i think the diversity of our business mix has proved to be very valuable and kept some stability so i dont know that that were thinking about this crisis as something thats going to change the way we do business i think its proven to be resilient stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thats really helpful congrats on a really great stable quarter appreciate it william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from michael rose of raymond james michael your line is open please proceed michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions hust wanted to go back to mortgage for a second the gain on sale margin popped up you had about a better quarter if you back out the msr gain i think you just made some comments i might have missed them but just wanted to get kind of the outlook there and then on the balance sheet side youve been portfolioing more of the mortgages which obviously contributed to this quarters growth just wanted to get the outlook there for how much you might plan on a quarterly basis to portfolio going forward thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure michael this is steve yeah youre right the gain on sale did come back a little bit this quarter i think our total production was around million of which we portfolio at about million of that so not quite i think its portfolio the adjustable arms on that was of that so most of its just were putting on in arm adjustablerate mortgages as we kind of think about the future we dont see a huge run up in that business for a while until things stabilize a little bit i think what were seeing most and why we have so much portfolio production is we have an owner person who is building a house theres just not enough inventory and so theyre doing that kind of a cp loan that turns out into an arm on our balance sheet typically these are professional doctor i think the number was in the mid40 of our portfolio of production with that in the first quarter so were seeing a lot of those types of opportunities which obviously indiscernible the wealth management and so on but were not seeing any huge pickup in sort of the traditional secondary business at least right now certainly its come off the lows a little bit but my sense is like anything else like all these fee businesses these are opportunities for us to build to continue to rebuild and build these businesses and so were actively recruiting mortgage bankers were actively recruiting some of our correspondent group were actively doing all those things not because its going to pay off in the next three to six months but because itll pay off in the next to and so thats kind of how were thinking about investing in those businesses south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful maybe just going back to deposits just wanted to kind of talk about flows so obviously you guys added some broker this quarter you had the seasonal decline in public funds just excluding those two kind of impacts the core deposits obviously went down can you just talk about trends kind of since everything happened in early march and have you seen balances stabilize to maybe perhaps grow and then what is the plan going forward to grow core deposits thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp hey michael its will ill start and maybe john or steve can jump in and elaborate id say the events of march probably caused us to be a little more focused on deposits within our market and within our various markets and so our sales ph hat on the deposit side became a little more important from that point forward and so i think what youll see from it at this point forward i think is a lot more activity in that regard if you look at the march to march activity essentially in that period you saw our commercial deposits down about million our other deposits in the rest of the bank is up about million so netnet over that period youre down about million we have a lot of swings in the various categories obviously from period to period and whats going on so thats not a real precise measure but like i said we were surprised how few calls we had to the call center maybe john can touch on some of the activity we have with indiscernible some of our customers right around that time john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah i go back to january even before the march events and we were seeing some drawdowns of deposits in january and i dont know a lot of that was the public funds fees thats seasonal things stabilized in february so we were feeling really really good about the stability of the deposit portfolio in february and then naturally things picked up and the runoff picked up in march april we started this deposit campaign and things stabilized again until you get to tax day and so thats kind of the ebbs and flows the last few months but for us michael the important thing was after march that we instilled confidence in our front line bankers and we met with probably or more of our leaders on that monday morning and i think the market correctly identified the risk to the system or uninsured deposits and the size of deposit accounts and we had some great data monday morning to share with our bankers that southstate had the lowest average deposit size of any of our peers and we had one of the lowest uninsured percentages of total deposits i think that gave our bankers a lot of confidence and that confidence in turn translated to our customers confidence william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp one other id point too i mentioned the commercial deposits our commercial line of credit utilization fell by roughly during the quarter so it looks like businesses tend to use their cash before they use our cash so to speak south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc that makes a lot of sense thanks for the insights maybe just finally for me i know capital is a precious commodity at this point but the stock has definitely come in you guys have a buyback in place any thoughts on using it and if not kind of near term what would kind of change the calculus for you thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah i think in the near term michael we think capital continue to allow capital to accrete and build is wise and that having capital as a strength will allow us to be more opportunistic should some opportunities develop coming out of this and as john mentioned in his prepared remarks weve got a history of doing that so in our view for the foreseeable future we continue to plan to let capital accrete itd be good to get some guidance some clarity on regulatory changes and even the regulatory changes that dont necessarily affect banks below billion statutorily or regulationwise that kind of guidance often flows downhill so well want to be able to understand and digest that as well longer term having a clearer picture on credit growth etcetera will allow us to figure out whats the best way to use whats hopefully still a very good capital formation rate michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks for taking my questions appreciate it operator operator instructions our next question comes from brody preston of ubs brody your line is open please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking the questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp ph you bet sure brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc steve i wanted to follow up just on the line of thought on the noninterestbearing i know its really hard to predict but you did give expectations for margin for the rest of the year and so it sounded like you were expecting some further mix there based on the other comments you gave so just wanted to ask within your margin guidance what are you guys expecting for noninterestbearing deposit mix stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 yeah i dont know that we would say that publicly we just dont know honestly but we have some we definitely think theres some movement from into the high we dont know if all that happens in the next two quarters or it happens over the next months were just not really sure so i would just assume that were going to be a lot like the industry and seeing the continued remix i think this quarter is about so i would assume that that probably trends maybe another quarter or so and then after that stabilizes because i think whats happening right now is theres a wakeup moment on march and thats probably i would expect until the fed stop raising rates lets assume they stop raising rates in may that theres some remix over this next quarter and then we probably get the most of that remix out of the picture i would think thatll dribble in over the next two to four quarters after that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats helpful i did also want to ask just on the correspondent bank could you give us a sense for what amount of your deposits come from your correspondent relationships and how those trended from to john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp that correspondent business we have a couple hundred million dollars in dda a few hundred million dollars in money market account maybe a couple hundred million in im going to guess million maybe weve always been pretty intentional about that business relative to being a fee income business versus a deposit gathering business and we do gather deposits we have about billion that sits off balance sheet with the eba which we sort of indiscernible wires and achs come through us but instead of us put that billion on our balance sheet we send it to the fed so weve always been pretty disciplined around how much of that we wanted to put on our balance sheet at any point in time so hopefully thats helpful brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc no that is i appreciate that and then i had two last questions appreciated the office slide i did want to ask is that is there owneroccupied office included within that of the total portfolio that you put out there and if there is do you have a sense for what that portion is john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thats the nonowner occupied office space brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it thank you very much for that clarification and then i did just want to ask again on the nonowner occupied portion i guess maybe i should have triangulated the office exposure before i asked that question but you did give the other nonowner occupied cre portfolios i did just want to ask on the hotel and the nursing home i know the nursing home is a very small portion for you but i did want to ask whats kind of what causes those two loan portfolios to have higher substandard and special mention ratios than the rest of the book im particularly interested in the nursing home just wondering if theres anything special going on there south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah you bet hotels is a carryover from covid and as we get financial statements on these hotels were continually upgrading those and we see that trend continuing thats just a hangover from covid actually hotels are performing very very well right now the convention business is about back to normal tourism in florida is about back to normal so we do not forecast problems in the near term in the hotel space on the assisted living space its less than of our loans but we had a couple of new facilities that came online during covid and basically its healthcare cost the fear of covid and the facilities are a little slower to become occupied brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it do you i know its really a small portion of your book but is that a trend i guess when you kind of look across assisted living facilities and the deals that kind of come across your desk are you seeing kind of that slowness in lease up or in occupancy across some of the newer facilities that are being built versus maybe some of the older ones that already had higher occupancy rates john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah i just think that that is a challenged space because of covid and i think itll be slow to come back to what it was prior to covid so i mean i think its just an overall covid issue william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah brody we saw ph most of that problems with labor inflation and labor shortages that kind of got it from all ph all ins as you said its not a big space for us nor is it big much of an appetite for us and weve had those on downgraded status really for a good while now weve got two nonaccrual assisted living facilities both of them are current on their payments so we dont anticipate a loss there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp actually on that note brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc thank you john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp i think of our nonperforming loans are current on payments south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay thats good thats

executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so hey so i just wanted to know if you could help us how we think about with loan yields and how they can increase from current levels ph maybe you get to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing steve i know you mentioned that to basis points increase of deposit cost in the second quarter but how much can you offset that with loan yields repricing and then how does that kind of trend towards the later half of the year when the fed pauses stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah brandon its a good question and thats kind of why we think theres stability in the back half of the year with margin if you look at our book weve got about we have a slide in the deck that talks about our fixed rate book so call about half of it is fixed rate weve got about so thats about billion or so weve got about billion thats floating daily so that probably has one more rate hike in it and then we have about billion that is going to be adjustable here in the next months and its weighted average rate is south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 so if its based on a oneyear treasury or what have you likely thats going to reprice and ph fix it somewhere and then we have some other adjustable thatll reprice about billion thatll reprice out past further than a year so as we think about loan yields we had a pretty significant move in loan yields i think its basis points for the portfolio in the first quarter i would say that probably will be to over the next couple of quarters and maybe we crest out at end of the year somewhere between and somewhere there brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it very very helpful and then on the deposit side what is kind of the continued appetite for brokered deposits and could you share kind of what the rate in maturity the brokered deposits were that you raised in the quarter stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah sure brandon if you kind of im going to give you a short answer and a long answer the short answer is we did about billion at about is ph right out of coupon and its got three quarters of a year duration so thats the short answer the longer answer is if you kind of look back at these times of stress times when like ill go back to march of we sort of did the same thing we borrowed i think about billion or billion of brokered deposits because it was really uncertain in march of about small businesses pandemic so the way we think about it is thats a source that we can get to quickly that we sort of indiscernible for the balance sheet but over time we would expect that to probably continue to ebb down if you went to pre cycle prepandemic december of i think we had about of our assets were in either home loan bank or brokered deposits so thats probably a good longterm average today were at my guess is well drip back down over time brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay makes sense and then lastly on credit net chargeoffs continue to be very low and some of your peers have already seen some normalization or blips im just curious just how much longer do you think you can keep net chargeoffs at this level and kind of when do you think that pace of normalization will start to begin john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah good question and well have to just see how this cycle unfolds but for the quarter we actually have net loan recoveries and i think we mentioned in the prepared remarks weve set aside million of reserves indiscernible last year but i think if you look at the loan portfolio weve got a lot of detail in the appendix there about our loan to values theyre in the high so we feel like weve got great equity and great sponsorship with our clients were just going to have to see how this cycle plays out this is unlike anything weve faced in our careers from a liquidity standpoint but we like our hand and the book that weve got brandon king q analyst truist securities inc south state corp ssb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2023 okay thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp you bet operator thank you our next question comes from david bishop of hovde group david your line is open please go ahead david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen and i had a jump on late john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc so i apologize if yeah good morning and apologize if this question has been asked and answered but hey just noticed the runup in shortterm liquidity here and borrowings here is that just a modicum of cautiousness given the dislocation this quarter and how should we think about that cash and shortterm investments trending through the rest of the year thanks stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah david this is steve what reiterated earlier was kind of that midsingledigit loan growth we reiterated billion interestearning asset base so we would expect i think we ended up a little bit higher than that if you looked at a spot basis on interestearning assets at the end of the quarter with a little bit more cash id imagine that cash would come down a little bit but thats sort of our guide so i dont think its a huge move either way david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc great thank you operator thank you at this stage
