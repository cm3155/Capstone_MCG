and ceo paul reilly paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good evening thank you for joining us today since our last earnings call we hosted our two major advisor conferences for both the independent and employee affiliation channels and also had our chairmans council recognition trip for our top employee advisors im so proud of our advisors unwavering dedication to serving their clients and helping them to navigate these volatile and uncertain times our advisors have also expressed their appreciation of our commitment to managing the firm for the long term and always striving to be a source of strength and stability for them and their clients its these shared values that have resulted in our success through multiple cycles since our founding and what makes me confident about our continued success in the future now turning to our results despite the challenging environment and elevated market volatility since the federal reserve started raising interest rates we generated record net revenues and earnings for the first nine months of the fiscal year reviewing third quarter results starting on slide the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of billion and net income available to common shareholders of million or per diluted share excluding expenses related to acquisitions adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share the increase in interestrelated revenues driven by higher short term interest rates drove significant earnings growth over the prior year net revenues increased and net income available to common shareholders grew quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately million and bank loan provisions for credit losses of million which was predominantly driven by significantly weakened macroeconomic assumptions for the moodys cre price index utilized in our cecl models notwithstanding these items we had a solid quarter in a tough market environment we generated strong returns with annualized returns on common equity of and annualized adjusted returns on tangible common equity of we believe this is a leading result especially considering our strong capital base moving to slide the strength of our pcg business really shined driving record assets this quarter we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of trillion record pcg assets and fee based accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion with our continued focus on retaining supporting and attracting highquality financial advisors pcg consistently generates strong organic growth which was evident again this quarter with domestic net new assets of billion representing a annualized growth rate on the beginning of the period domestic pcg assets however ill note net new assets in our advisor count were negatively impacted by an independent contractor relationship raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 whose affiliation with the firm ended in the fiscal third quarter this was a planned and mutual separation and more than of the assets and advisors stayed with raymond james the impact of the portion that moved off the platform this quarter was billion in assets and financial advisors though our net new asset metric would have been even stronger after adjusting for this separation which we do not believe will negatively impact our profitability during the prior months we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing 12month production and nearly billion of client assets at their previous firms total clients domestic sweep and enhanced savings program balances ended the quarter at billion up from march of the enhanced savings program with its competitive rate and robust fdic insurance continued to attract significant cash this quarter offsetting a decline in client suite balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and tax payments in april total bank loans decreased from the preceding quarter to billion primarily reflecting a modest decline in corporate loans as new origination demand continues to be tepid in the market moving to slide private client group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million yearoveryear asset base revenues declined due to market declines however pcg results were lifted by the benefit of higher interest rates and interestrelated revenues and fees the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax loss of million revenues declined compared to the prioryear quarter mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenues the extremely challenging market environment particularly for investment banking has strained the nearterm profitability of the segments results as we explained at analyst and investor day the segments results are negatively impacted by amortization sharebased compensation for prior years as well as growth investments however we are focused on managing controllable expenses as nearterm revenues are depressed the asset management segment generated pretax income of million on net revenues of million the increase in net revenues and pretax income over the preceding quarter were largely the result of higher assets and feebased accounts the bank segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million third quarter nim for the bank segment of rose basis points over the yearago quarter but as expected decreased basis points from the preceding quarter primarily due to higher funding cost we continue to add diverse higher cost funding sources and shifted more of the lowercost suite funding to third party banks while this negatively impacted the bank segments nim paul shoukry will walk us through how this benefits both clients and the firm overall looking at the fiscal year to date results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion and record net income available to common shareholders of billion up and respectively over the prior years records we arent seeing many other firms in our industry generate records so far this year additionally we generated strong annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the nine month period on slide the strength of the pcg and bank segments for the first nine months of the year primarily reflects the benefit of strong organic growth in the private client group the successful integration of tristate capital and raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 higher interestrelated revenues when compared to the record activity levels in the yearago period weaker capital markets results reflect the challenging environment for investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenue despite incremental revenues from the sumridge acquisition and now ill turn it over to paul shoukry for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial results paul paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting on slide consolidated net revenues were a record billion in the third quarter up over the prior year and sequentially being able to generate record quarterly revenues during a period when capital market revenues were so challenged across the industry reinforces the value of having diverse and complementary businesses anchored by the private client group business which reached record client assets this quarter asset management and related administrative fees declined compared to the prioryear quarter and increased sequentially due to the higher assets and fee base accounts at the end of the preceding quarter along with one additional billable day in the fiscal third quarter this quarter feebased assets grew to a new record providing a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal fourth quarter brokerage revenues of million declined year over year and sequentially this year over year decline was largely due to lower fixed income brokerage revenues in the capital markets segment as well as lower assetbased trail revenues in pcg ill discuss accountant service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million declined yearoveryear and sequentially as experienced across the industry both underwriting and ma revenues continued to be challenged this quarter we are optimistic that the environment is improving and we continue to see a healthy investment banking pipeline and solid new business activity however there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timings of deals launching and closing given the heightened market volatility so while we may not see significant improvement in the fiscal fourth quarter we expect better results over the next to months moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep and enhanced saving program balances ended the quarter at billion up over the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets advisors continued to serve their clients effectively leveraging our competitive cash offerings the enhanced savings program attracted approximately billion in new deposits this quarter a large portion of the total cash coming in to esp has been new cash brought to the firm by advisors highlighting the attractiveness of this product and raymond james being viewed as a source of strength and stability the enhanced savings program balances exceeded billion this week continuing to grow modestly and partially offsetting the decline in sweep balances largely due to the approximately billion of quarterly fee billings in july as i said on last quarters call it feels like were closer to the end of the cash sorting dynamic than we are to the beginning and we have certainly seen a deceleration of the activity over the past several months however we are not ready to declare the end of that dynamic we will need more time with stable balances and interest rates this quarters sweep balances with third party banks increased billion to billion giving us a large funding cushion when attractive growth opportunities surface these thirdparty balances grew faster than we expected last quarter as a strong growth of enhanced savings program balances at raymond james bank allowed for more balances to be deployed off balance sheet while this dynamic has negatively impacted the raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 bank segments nim because of the geography of the lower cost sweep balances being swept off balance sheet it ultimately provides clients with an attractive deposit solution while also optimizing the firms funding flexibility looking forward we have ample funding and capital to support attractive loan growth turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up over the prior year quarter and down compared to the preceding quarter the sequential decrease in firmwide net interest income was partially offset by higher rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks if you recall on our last earnings call we anticipated a decline in these interestrelated revenues so we are pleased with a better than expected decline of just which was partly a function of higher than anticipated growth of enhanced savings program balances the bank segments net interest margin decreased basis points sequentially to for the quarter and the average yield of rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased basis points to while there are many variables that will impact the actual results we currently expect combined net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks to be around lower in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fiscal third quarter as we expect some further contraction of the bank segment net interest income to be partially offset by an increase in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks as we have always said instead of concentrating on maximizing nim over the near term we are more focused on preserving flexibility and growing net interest income in rjbdp fees over the long term which we believe we are well positioned to do moving to consolidated expenses on slide compensation expense was billion and the total compensation ratio for the quarter was the adjusted compensation ratio was during the quarter which we are very pleased with especially given the challenging environment for capital markets noncompensation expenses of million increased sequentially as paul mentioned earlier the quarter included elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately million and a bank loan provision for credit losses of million the million of provisions for legal and regulatory matters was made up of several items that all hit this quarter some of those items were closed out and publicly disclosed and some of the other items are still in process and we therefore will not be able to provide much more detail on those in this call additionally this quarter included seasonally higher conference and eventrelated expenses the bank loan provision for credit losses for the quarter of million increased million over the preceding quarter largely reflecting weaker assumptions for commercial real estate valuations in the moodys cre price index and in particular the office price index which resulted in higher allowances ill discuss more related to the credit quality in the bank segment shortly in summary while there has been some noise with elevated legal and regulatory matters over the past two quarters none of the other noncompensation expenses are coming in too much differently than wed expected when we last provided guidance for the fiscal year but as you all know legal and regulatory expenses and provisions for loan losses using the cecl methodology are inherently difficult to predict importantly we remain focused on managing expenses while continuing to invest in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows a pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the current quarter we generated a pretax margin of and an adjusted pretax margin of a strong result given the industrywide challenges impacting capital markets and the aforementioned provisions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 on slide at quarterend total assets were billion a sequential decrease largely reflecting lower client cash balances in cip during the quarter liquidity and capital remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target the tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized the tier leverage ratio reflects over billion of excess capital above our conservative target which would still be two times the regulatory requirement to be well capitalized our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth we also have significant sources of contingent funding we have a million revolving credit facility which was recently renewed and upsized in april and nearly billion fhlb capacity in the bank segment slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters during the fiscal third quarter the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of nearly per share as of july approximately million remained available under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization and we currently intend on continuing our planned repurchases as we have discussed previously lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was at the quarter end we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation supply chain constraints higher interest rates and a potential recession on the corporate loan portfolio as we have done from time to time when we believe theres an attractive riskreward during the quarter we proactively sold approximately million of corporate loans at an average price of around of par value there continues to be a lot of attention on the commercial real estate across the industry given the challenge with property values and interest rates so let me briefly cover our portfolio across the bank segment we have cre and reit loans of approximately billion which represents of total loans our office portfolio is billion only representing approximately of the bank segments total loans overall we have deliberately limited the exposure to office real estate and we underwrote office loans with what we believed were conservative criteria but we will continue to monitor each loan closely given the industrywide challenges now i will turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as i said at the start of the call im pleased with our results for the first nine months of fiscal and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a challenging environment and while there is still nearterm economic uncertainty i believe we are in a position of strength and are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses and the private client group next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the sequential increase of asset and fee based account and im raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 optimistic over the long term we will continue delivering industryleading growth as current and prospective advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and leading technology and product solutions in the capital markets segment there are some signs of improvement in investment banking and we continue to have a healthy ma pipeline and good engagement levels but while there is reason for optimism we expect the pace and timing of transactions to be heavily influenced by market conditions and would more likely pick up over the next six to months in the fixed income space depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities putting pressure on our brokerage activity we hope that once rates and cash balances stabilize we could start to see an improvement so while there are some nearterm challenges over the long term we believe the capital markets business is well positioned for growth given the investments weve made over the last five years which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share we will continue to prudently manage expenses in these businesses as nearterm revenues continue to come under pressure obviously well have to take more significant action if the industry headwinds prove to be more long term in the asset management segment financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter up compared to the preceding quarter which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive throughout the quarter we remain confident that strong growth of assets and fee based accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution and operational and marketing synergies in the bank segment our focus over the next several months will continue to be fortifying the balance sheet with diversified funding sources and prudently growing assets to support client demand we have seen securities based loan payoffs decelerate and expect demand for those loans to eventually recover as clients get comfortable with the current level of rates with little activity in the market corporate loan growth has been tepid however we believe the yield environment has improved with ample cash sitting with thirdparty banks and lots of capital we are well positioned to lend once activity picks up in closing we have strong prospects for future growth given our strong competitive positioning in all of our businesses and our ample capital and liquidity i want to take this time to thank our advisors and associates for their continued perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day especially in these uncertain times when clients need trusted advice the most thank you all for what you do and with that operator will you please open the line for questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you very much operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey paul and paul its michael anagnostakis on for steven here i guess just starting one off on maybe the balance sheet reinvestment strategy here you highlighted potentially capitalizing on some of the yield opportunities in loans down the road but given improved the improving sorting picture the funding capacity you have on the off balance sheet cash and the fact that were near peak rates is adding duration to lock in some higher yield here something that youre considering more actively paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think youve known us long enough that we dont play the betting on interest rate games so we like a floating rate balance sheet that served us well even though maybe for a couple years we got criticized it made it kind of easy to get through this last year and we certainly have some duration in our balance sheet and bank in terms of mortgages and other things but again were not looking at trying to make an interest rate bet overall michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc okay thats helpful and yeah for my followup maybe switching to the capital markets side were hearing a lot of your peers highlight green shoots as well as a potential recovery in dcm and ecm but capital raising activity at rayja was relatively weaker during the quarter is that just a function of the mix or were there other factors at play i know you said you expect better results in but how should we be thinking about the outlook for that business relative to what your peers have been highlighting thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think weve all been in the same boat i mean weve had the mix of our businesses or difference with the timing of quarters but weve already had a number of transactions close for this quarter but we see green shoots and that both activity level backlog new deals are all positive factors but we just dont see a big rush to get everything done so although we expect the business to improve our history and our cycles just tell us that they take a little longer than we would all like or a lot of what bankers expected so i think were going to all track along in the industry on this hopefully it improves well play along were positioned we have a lot of clients interested a lot of mandates but for them to come weve had those for the last year so the question is when are people really able to transact in the market i did want to add something to your first question on banking although we dont make duration plays we are seeing spreads widen in loans and we think theres an opportunity again by keeping our capital in cash that at the right time and the right loans well be able to grow more on spread than making interest rate bets as a strategy raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks for taking operator our next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw please proceed with your question kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening maybe first question on cash and esp balances with now having built back to over billion of thirdparty deposits and noting in your prepared remarks that you have adequate liquidity for growing the balance sheet do you anticipate taking any steps near term or have you already taken any steps yet to reduce some of the incentives in place to grow those esp balances much further from current levels paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey kyle no we really again the esp program is a product that we created to serve clients and to help advisors bring in assets from their clients and so really whats driving our growth strategy with esp is first and foremost client demand and advisors are asking us to keep this product available for their clients and of course theres some capacity constraints given we offer up to million of fdic insurance so theres a network of banks and theres capacity constraints associated with that but were not looking to sort of manage those balances down based on our nearterm needs long term we know were confident well need the funding and so this gives us ample opportunity to grow the balance sheet when client demand for loans resurfaces kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc and its an easy adjustment for us too because you can adjust rate which gives you some attrition and you can stop the program if you had to or slow it down so but as of right now cash sorting has slowed but it hasnt stopped if you look at everyones reports we will continue to leave the program open to our advisors as long as we have capacity kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood and then for my followup i was hoping we could dig into sbl demand a little bit during the investor day it seemed like you were hopeful that we were nearing a point where sbl demand was starting to come back and it looks like balances remained flat quarteronquarter after a few quarters of declining so first just wondering if you believe those balances have finally troughed and then given the recent equity market resurgence here is that having any incremental impact on kind of clients willingness to borrow against securities so just if youre talking about sbl demand overall and then any leading indicators i guess you might be seeing on the sbl demand side thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i think we have certainly seen a deceleration of pay downs which is what really picked up as rates increased and borrowing cost increased we saw the expected pay downs over the last six to months kind of was particularly in june and even in july those pay downs have really slowed down and so we think this is a good baseline were not smart enough to call a trough or a floor but we are optimistic that over the next six to months the markets stay relatively resilient that well see kind of a pickup of demand off this level off these sort of levels going forward kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator the next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good afternoon thanks hey paul i want to go back to your guidance on cash revenues to down from this quarter at the same time cash balances seem to be stabilizing as you pointed out the sorting has been slowing down we got another rate hike here today so im just trying to understand the assumptions behind this guidance and as part of that can you give us an update on rjbdp balances at the bank as well as at thirdparty banks paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah so a lot of pieces to that question alex but hopefully is a conservative guide you know last quarter we guided down and it actually ended up being down so we were very pleased to outperform our guide from last quarter just given the uncertainty we think its always prudent to give conservative guidance around these type of things so youre right there are a lot of puts and takes you know we would expect the bdp fee portion to be up just because balances are up so significantly quarter over quarter so as long as that stays somewhat resilient over the course of the quarter we would expect those bdp fees to be up and then conversely with the interest income at the bank we would expect pressure there just because well have a full quarter impact of all of the esp balances that we raised during the third quarter and as we raised those balances we moved the lower cost balances from the bank to the thirdparty banks so theres some geography involved in that from one to the other but when we put those things together in our best guess that balances going forward which can change dramatically over the next couple of months thats where we come up with the down between both bdp fees and nii but again were hoping that we can exceed that guidance if things hold and in terms of what were seeing so far in the month of july really the balances have stabilized i mean we did see a decrease in the sweep balances due to the quarterly fee billings in july which is what you would expect but outside of that we really have seen kind of a sort of absolutely a deceleration of cash sorting activity i mean raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 outside of those declines from the quarterly fee billings cash the sweep balances were fairly stable outside of those quarterly fee billings and the esp balances continued to grow alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay that makes more sense second question to paul paul senior on investment banking i guess so i hear your comments around the pipeline is getting better and it sounds like you guys are hopeful that in six to months revenue will sort of come back up here so are you effectively implying that investment banking revenues will be in this kind of millionish range for the next couple of quarters and then if thats the scenario is there room to more aggressively manage the expense base to bring that business to profitability or breakeven even in that sort of scenario or you really need to see a much better revenue picture to become profitable in capital markets paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well actually got us both pretty well there youre calling me old and paul young so but i think that its really hard to tell if you look at backlog and things you could say itll start improving but i think until the market really goes youll see it with everybody so i dont know what our position would be that would make it a lot different in the market when it returns so we do have a lot more capacity we invested a lot of those investments are with people that we recruited and did acquisitions and they kind of theyre part of us now so yeah weve already looked at weve trimmed some costs and we think itll continue longer term we would do more but were really trying to keep the team in place that we spent five years in building i think theyll be very very productive so hopefully that everyones green shoots turns into trees and its were hoping for i think paul gave six to months before we think industrywide not just us itll really start getting but thats the unknown it really just its the unknown we certainly have the capacity and once the market picks up i think were well positioned clients are engaged but thats the million question we cant answer but if we ever got to the point we thought it was more of a permanent or longer term kind of hiatus we would manage costs as tightly as we could alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you all right thank you both paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay operator the next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please proceed with your question brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 thanks for taking my question and i know paul that you i wont go into junior or senior paul cfo paul you commented that you were limited in what you could say on the legal charges which is totally understandable not all resolved but now this is the second quarter in a row weve had some legal charges and is it right to assume were probably going to see a third quarter because you said theyre not all resolved and so therefore should we expect some bleed into next quarter how should we think about that paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean there could be certainly additional reserves and there probably will be additional reserves in future quarters but were hoping that therell be a pretty big drop off from the million or so that we saw this quarter that was obviously unusual for us if you look back at our history so time will tell but obviously this quarter was obviously elevated relative to sort of what you look at for an average reserve quarter for us brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay fair enough and then wondering if you could give a little bit of color around the ending of the relationship with the independent contractor that you spoke about that impacted nna this quarter what kind of counterparty was that and what led to the decision by either them or you to go in a different direction paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think were not going to talk about firms or stuff but i think that just based on our strategy it was an independent contractor firm a normal independent contractor firm based on their strategy and what they wanted to do and ours and us looking at our profitability and i think what they thought they could do in other things we just thought it would be better to have another home and they went ahead and we supported their move and we again as we said we kept a lot of the advisers and the advisers had a choice so i would call it just strategic differences in both of our businesses and profitability as weve said we dont think that theres a negative impact to our profitability on that change so were both making our bets and both going in the directions we think were right brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you for the color operator the next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global securities please proceed with your question james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hi thanks good afternoon paul just maybe can you talk a little bit about can you speak to the maturity profile of the afs book its still yielding around a little over so just great to get your thoughts on how quickly that portfolio runs off and you get a chance to reinvest that at higher rates paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 yeah and we i mean the average maturity on that portfolio is somewhere in the four year range and so it takes some time for it to run off were probably going to see a maybe a billion or so of a run off a year at current levels so itll take some time and frankly we grew that securities portfolio during that covid period because we had pretty significant increase in client cash balances as youll recall and there really wasnt demand from third party banks so we took it on to our own balance sheet to accommodate those cash balances and fortunately we kept the vast majority of those as paul indicated in very very short term treasuries and didnt take too much duration risk and so now as we look forward were really going to grow that or let that securities portfolio run off so the liquidity in the balance sheet should be somewhere around of the banks balance sheets combined which will let us reinvest a lot of those repayments to bank loans which again as paul said have higher spreads and higher yields on them so theyll be a nice kind of tailwind for us over the next several years hopefully james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right and then when you just think about nii after this coming quarter down i guess combined down maybe nii down a little more how do you think about do you feel like once you kind of catch up and esp balances are not growing as rapidly that that nim starts in the bank starts to stabilize and niis can be flat to up or still think that further declines paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc and just to be clear when we raise those esp balances cash is fungible the cash that we move off balance sheet to thirdparty banks is still making a higher spread than the costs james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc sure paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc of the esp balances while we sort of await investment in higher yielding assets and loans so its still not a huge net positive but its still a net positive for us so we offer the clients a product thats attractive allows advisors to gain more wallet share from their clients and we essentially place that cash with thirdparty banks until we have better investment opportunities theres a lot of geography involved in terms of what shows up in nii and bdp piece but we obviously look at it from a consolidated basis so its really a win for the clients a win for the advisors and a win for the firm and gives us a lot of capacity to grow the balance sheet over time so thats kind of how were thinking about it and to the extent that when demand returns for loans both corporate loans and then loans to the private client group clients then it will certainly be a nice tailwind to our net interest income james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think if you look industry if you look industry wide theres still a competition for cash as long as there is and an upward in the feds raising rates its going to impact i think rates on both ends and until that dynamics once that dynamic stabilizes or if it ever does go the other way which some people predict we havent believed the forward curve for over a year now but once that does happen spreads should improve but thats we dont know so were operating we know on the esp balances theyre not cheap but we still make a spread off of them so its a positive nii and so theres no harm in raising for clients and we make a little money too so thanks okay thanks paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc and just to be clear one last comment on this is because ive got some questions over the email is our guide the guide that i provided on nii and bdp fees is really based on todays rate action so were not trying to factor in the forward curve or anything like that as paul said im not sure we totally buy the forward curve but im not sure were certainly not going to give guidance based on the fed cutting rates any time soon james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc perfectly fair thanks paul operator operator instructions and the next question comes from the line of michael cyprys with morgan stanley please proceed with your question michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon thanks for taking the question i was hoping you might be able to provide some color on the marketplace for recruiting advisors today how you see that evolving and how you might characterize the pipeline thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so i think ive gotten this question almost every quarter now for years since ive been ceo its competitive i mean i think all firms are kind of in the market the costs have gone up somewhat certainly over the years so we have maintained our position not being the highest bidder in these cases and using it as positive selection but its certainly competitive you have the brokerdealer employee channels you have the independent firms and the ph raa aggregators competing especially at the high end for all their clients so the good news for us is we continue to compete very well we continue the pipeline is strong the biggest change probably over the last two years is the number of just very large teams that we talk to versus years ago so but the pipeline is great its been picking up every quarter at a slow start and its continued to pick up each quarter and so were optimistic but it is competitive michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 great thanks and just a followup question on the esp balances just curious how you think about the duration of those esp deposits versus your sweep deposits and other funding sources and how do you take that into consideration when you think about ultimately reinvesting and putting some of those deposits to work paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah well its a relatively new product for us we launched it in march so well learn more as we have more experience with it and as rates stabilize and those sorts of things so we always try to have cushions around kind of how we think about funding deployment and maybe even more so a bigger cushion when youre dealing with a new deposit product in a volatile and uncertain rate environment and so you look at where we are today weve had a target of thirdparty balances of around billion that we talked about just six months ago and now were up to billion or north of billion of thirdparty balances and the banks are still holding very high cash balances more than they need in a normal environment and so we have a significant funding cushion and opportunity over the next several months to really kind of have better history and understanding of the sort of the reinvestment of the enhanced savings product balances paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think you can also look at most of the esp balances came from cash balances elsewhere money markets treasuries i mean so it was really i think if you look at the assets a cash yield play it just happened to be secured with fdic and more people viewed it as more secure with fdic insurance so its not like it came out of everybody ran from equities into the product and if you look at the percentage of our assets in cash are certainly not at were more closer to historic levels than we are record levels i mean or so but as paul said were always more cautious with the new product and understand it can move and also are used to competing so we will see in the quarter but again we have a big cushion right now and thats why we havent slowed down deposits just understanding that it could have a little more volatility but well see michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator and our last question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please proceed with your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great thanks so much good evening paul and paul ill just keep it at one most was covered here but do want to ask about corporate ma for the firm and we obviously saw recent press around a reasonably sized public independent broker that could be mulling a sale and so i thought that was interesting and so without getting into details around where raymond james might be interested specifically it would be great just to hear about kind of what you guys are seeing in the marketplace because it would seem that conditions could be getting better for you guys as well just with valuations recovering your stocks up as well confidence is improving in the marketplace to some degree and would just assume thats a little bit of a better environment for ma so just love to talk about what you guys are seeing in the marketplace today and if you can what that pipeline of opportunities is looking like right now relative to i dont know a year ago raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26jul2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well thanks devin as you know we just hired a new head of our corporate development practice so we certainly didnt do that to slow down and i didnt see the article youre alluding to but weve always have had a course of firms that we believe would fit us well especially in the private client group space where we really know them all and our focus hasnt changed and as weve said the problem with most theyre private or not for sale so it doesnt help but we stay close and if it ever changes we want to be their only or first call so we continue to keep that strategy and then on the ma with suraj whos joined us is really focused on also other opportunities weve looked at ma firms that we talked to pre market adjustment and because we thought valuations were way off and we continue dialogue with those that we think fill holes in the practice and again pricing has gotten much better there weve met a few in the asset management space and some weve talked to and couldnt come up with pricing versus the market but thats not unusual for us and looking at other ancillary technology fitin plays like sumridge which has really been a huge positive so our eye is not off the ball at all for ma in fact we always assume the tougher the market the better opportunity to really add people to the family so again has to be a culture fit strategic be able to integrate it and then its price and so were pretty price disciplined too so were working away and we always have so but where we didnt close any for a while and we closed three quickly so you know who knows devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc all right good stuff thanks so much guys paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator and there are no further questions mr reilly ill turn the call back to you paul c reilly chairman chief executive
