everyone in the second quarter synchrony delivered strong financial results including net earnings of million or per diluted share return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of synchrony continued to demonstrate strong growth in financial performance as consumer behavior reversed to prepandemic norms and as our products and value propositions resonate strongly across our diversified set of platforms and partners during the second quarter we opened million new accounts and grew average active accounts by on a core basis once again we set a new record as our billion of purchase volume reached our highest levels synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 ever for a second quarter these strong sales continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified products and platforms health wellness purchase volume grew compared to last year reflecting broadbased growth in active accounts along with higher spend per active account the growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher average active accounts and reflected continued momentum in several of our new programs in diversified value purchase volume increased reflecting higher outofpartner spend strong retailer performance and the continued impact of newer value propositions driving penetration growth lifestyle purchase volume increased reflecting growth in average transaction values in outdoor and luxury and in home auto purchase volume was largely unchanged versus last year as the benefit of higher average transaction values and growth in commercial products was largely offset by lower retail traffic and a reduction in gas prices dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the total purchase volume in the quarter and increased on a core basis with several of our newer value propositions continuing to drive elevated growth our view into the consumer informed by the billions of realtime transactional data that we regularly monitor shows continued normalization in consumer behavior toward prepandemic levels which has progressed in line with our expectations average transaction frequency continued to grow in the quarter while average transaction values declined modestly this decline however was partly attributable to lower gas prices a deeper dive into our outofpartner spend shows continued stability in key discretionary categories such as restaurants and entertainment as well as in nondiscretionary categories like grocery and discount stores the reduction in average values was noted even among our highest credit quality borrowers which was also accompanied by some modest slowing in transaction frequency following the trends from previous quarters our younger borrowers as well as those in lower credit grades continue to reduce the pace of spend this quarter given the seasonal impact of tax refunds we saw a small sequential increase in our payment rates largely driven by higher credit quality segments yearoveryear however payment rates continued to decline across age and credit bands meanwhile the external deposit data we track shows that the average consumer savings balance has declined approximately from the first quarter but remain approximately above 2020s average level so taken together the payment spend and savings trends were watching suggest that consumers continue to be well supported by the constructive labor market and relatively healthy balance sheets as they gradually revert to their prepandemic norms and as we continue to closely monitor the health of our consumers we are also advancing the key strategic priorities of our business to position synchrony for longterm success one of our key priorities is the continued expansion of our multiproduct strategy across partners distribution channels

second quarter results demonstrated the power of our differentiated model our broad reach across industries and verticals and the compelling value propositions offered on our products were key drivers of our resilient purchase volume these core synchrony strengths combined with our disciplined approach to underwriting our diverse funding model and our rsa arrangements continue to provide effective offsets to changes in the macroeconomic environment on a core basis ending receivables grew versus last year this was driven by a combination of approximately basis points decrease in payment rate and a growth in core purchase volume our second quarter payment rate of remains approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear prepandemic historical average synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 net interest income increased to billion reflecting growth in interest and fees from higher loan receivables and stronger loan receivable yield partially offset by the impact of divestitures in the prioryear period on a core basis interest and fees grew driven by loan receivables growth higher benchmark rates and a lower payment rate as credit continues to normalize towards prepandemic levels our net interest margin of declined basis points as higher funding cost more than offset the benefit of strong loan yields more specifically loan receivable yields grew basis points and contributed basis points to net interest margin higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional basis point to net interest margin offsetting these improvements was higher interestbearing liability cost which increased basis points to and reduced net interest margin by basis points finally our mix of interestearning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately basis points as continued deposit inflows allow us to build liquidity and prefund anticipated receivables growth in the second half of this year rsas of million in the second quarter were of average loan receivables the million decline from the prior year reflected higher net chargeoffs and the impact of portfolios sold in the prior year partially offset by higher net interest income the rsa continues to provide critical alignment with our partners and stability in synchronys risk adjusted returns as demonstrated through this period of credit normalization and higher funding cost provision for credit losses increased to billion reflecting higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve build which was largely driven by growth in loan receivables the decline in other income was driven by million gain on portfolio sales recorded in the prioryear period other expenses increased to billion primarily driven by growth related items as well as operational losses and technology investments our efficiency ratio for the second quarter improved by approximately basis points compared to last year to in total synchrony generated second quarter net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and return on tangible common equity of next ill cover our key credit trends on slide as payment behavior continues to revert towards prepandemic historical averages our delinquency and net chargeoff rates continue to normalize towards prepandemic performance our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year which is approximately basis points lower than the second quarter of our 90plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year which is approximately basis points lower than the second quarter of our net chargeoff rate was versus last year which is approximately basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of to where synchronys risk adjusted returns are more fully optimized while credit continues to normalize in line with our expectations were actively monitoring our portfolio and have undertaken some proactive targeted actions to position our portfolio into these actions have been focused on certain types of inactive accounts as well as segments of the portfolio where were seeing significant score migration into nonprime and are unlikely to have a material impact on purchase volume focusing on reserves our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was down basis points from the in the first quarter the reserve build of million in the quarter was largely synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 driven by receivables growth our provision did not include any material changes in our qualitative reserves or significant changes in our macroeconomic assumptions turning to slide funding capital and liquidity continue to be highlights of synchronys performance during the second quarter our consumer bank offerings continued to resonate with customers we experienced positive net flows each week culminating in direct deposit growth of billion in the first quarter which was partially offset by lower broker deposits deposits at quarter end represented of our total funding the remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at and of our funding respectively we remain focused on being active issuers in both markets as conditions allow total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion up million from last year as a percent of total assets liquidity represented down basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth focusing on our capital ratios as a reminder we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately basis points in january and will continue to make annual adjustments of approximately basis points each year until january of the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet under the cecl transition rules we ended the second quarter with the cet1 ratio of basis points lower than last years levels of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year continuing on our commitment to robust capital returns synchrony announced approval of an incremental billion share repurchase authorization through june of in addition to the million remaining on the prior authorization we also announced our intention to increase the companys common stock dividend by to per share from per share beginning in the third quarter during the second quarter we returned million to shareholders reflecting million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends at the end of the quarter we had billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization synchrony will continue to execute on our capital plan as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan well also continue to seek opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock we have a strong history of capital generation and management which is empowered by our resilient business model given the uncertainties in both the macroeconomic environment and the financial services industry synchrony remains focused on actively managing the assets we originate and prudently managing the capital we generate to optimize our long term value creation and resiliency finally please refer to slide of our presentation for more detail on our full year outlook we expect our ending loan receivables to grow by or more for reflecting the combined impact of the payment rate moderation and purchase volume growth we continue to expect payment rates to normalize but remain above prepandemic levels through the remainder of this year we now expect our net interest margin within a range of to for the full year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 the net interest margin in the first half was influenced by higher liquidity due to stronger than anticipated deposits flows and receivables growth prefunding deposit betas also trended better than expected in the first half but were still seeing growing competition for deposits our revised full year outlook incorporates these first half trends as well as the anticipated impacts of further interest rate increases by the federal reserve and the possibility of higher deposit betas in the second half of the year as a reminder we expect our net interest margin to fluctuate quartertoquarter driven by higher liquidity as we prefund growth resulting in variation in the mix of interestearning assets and interest and fee growth partially offset by rising reversals as credit continues to normalize turning to our credit outlook we now expect delinquencies to reach prepandemic levels during the second half of versus our previous expectation of it approaching peak in midyear net chargeoff should follow similar but lagged progression through the year generally speaking loss dollars will not reach a fully normalized level until approximately six months following the peak in delinquencies given the slightly more moderate pace of delinquency normalization we now expect net chargeoffs to trend towards the lower end of our prior outlook between and we continue anticipating losses reaching fully normalized levels on an annual basis in we expect the rsa to trend below our prior outlook and to be between and of average loan receivables for the full year this improved range reflects the impact of continued credit normalization lower net interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth and given our higher than anticipated growth in the first half we now anticipate quarterly operating expenses to trend at approximately billion for we remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year taken together synchronys differentiated model continues to power resilient financial results to a range of environments and we look forward to delivering on our commitments as we close out the second half of ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian synchronys differentiated model has positioned the company well for evolving environments we consistently power bestinclass experiences for our customers and strong outcomes for our partners even as their needs change our business generates strong capital were adept at putting that capital to work in an effective prudent manner to deliver sustainable longer term growth at attractive risk adjusted returns as i look ahead to the remainder of this year i am confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver value to our many stakeholders with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions as a reminder please limit yourself to one question and one followup question well take our first question from arren cyganovich with citi arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc with your payment rates still normalizing and purchase volumes relatively stable whats going to drive somewhat a bit of a deceleration in your growth from where its been recently to kind of closer to 10plus that youve talked about for year end brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning arren and thanks for the question i think its a little bit less about our current period you are right we do anticipate that payment rate continuing to moderate as we move into back end but be elevated versus the prepandemic period and we do continue to expect to see on a dollar basis strong purchase volume growth i think when you look back at deceleration last year coming out of omicron and the pandemic period there was an acceleration beginning in the second quarter through the end of the year which provides more difficult comps so i think when you look at it on a ph v basis and the asset build as payment rate really came off its high last year its just a more difficult comp i think when you think about the volume were going to put up here in the second quarter all the way through the end of the year i think its going to be strong when you look at that performance across all of our sales platforms arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks and then in the digital and health wellness platforms both of those were showing continued really strong growth there can you provide a little color about within those segments whats driving the strong growth there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah sure look i would say were very pleased with the growth that were seeing across all of our platforms you look at receivables up for the company health wellness leading the charge at digital up but even home auto up is a really good result and really pacing ahead of our expectations so far this year weve talked about in the past health wellness is one of the platforms where weve made incremental investments in marketing and products and so i think youre seeing those investments pay off digital youve obviously got the benefit of the new programs that sit inside of digital all of which are performing really well so we would continue to expect to overindex in those two platforms brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks arren synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks arren operator thank you well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey don donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc i was wondering if i could dig in a little bit more what you are seeing in terms of consumer behavior i know in the past youve talked about customer callins and what youre hearing in terms of slower wage or working less hours has there been any change there brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah ill start on this one i think look the consumer is still strong i think there is obviously still spending excess savings are coming down a bit but theyre still trending above levels so when you look at having a pretty strong labor market the one surprise id say so far this year is how resilient the consumer has been you certainly see that on the growth side we just reported our second quarter was a record in terms of purchase volume credit is very much in line with our expectations maybe a touch better were still operating below levels were below our longterm target of to so everything were seeing on the consumer is still pretty positive with that said were still operating cautiously were monitoring this every hour every day were listening to the calls i wouldnt say were hearing anything abnormal it really is kind of in line with our expectations and as expected credit will continue to normalize through the balance of this year and into the next donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and on the allowance rate are you still thinking that sort of steady to may be improving a bit brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for that don the first half of the year i think when we look at the reserve provisioning there really have been growth from provisions i think ph and respectively for the first quarter and the second quarter again we continue to expect that migration back down towards cecl day one i think the delinquency formation that we have seen has been in line with our expectations so again that will trend out over time i think the one shift why we havent changed our macroeconomic assumptions or really things around synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 student loans theyve just been a little bit slower which is why i think you see us today talking about getting back to that prepandemic levels of delinquency in midsecond half of this year so again it will migrate continue to migrate down as long as we believe the macro backdrop comes in in line with our expectations donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks don operator thank you well take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning thank you for taking my questions maybe to start i think the first question i had was just on the regulatory front specifically thinking around cfpbs late fee rules and also the inquiry into the deferred interest medical cards maybe just talk about your perspective on those issues where things have shaken out and if theres any updates to share and how youre just preparing for those eventualities thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure so let me start on late fees weve been working on this for over a year now when the initial kind of proposal came out were having very productive conversations with our partners around different offsets i would tell you that they clearly understand this is an issue that the entire industry has to deal with its likely going to result in new pricing models and pricing actions across all issuers so weve had those discussions with our partners id say no real surprises ph as theyre expecting to see the things that were proposing like higher aprs different types of fees penalty pricing and weve also been having a good dialogue around underwriting and i think they fully appreciate that without some of these pricing offsets that a fairly significant portion of the customers that we underwrite today might lose access to credit and just to be clear thats something that we dont want thats something that they dont want so our interests are very much aligned on that point look at the end of the day our goal is to protect the partners we want to offset the impact here and continue to underwrite the customers that we do today and then lastly id just say look theres a lot still to be decided here we expect to see a final rule sometime in the fourth quarter its likely to be litigated thats i think the consensus at least ph what were hearing but weve had teams focused on this for a while were as prepared as we could be and so well just continue to play through and give you updates as we learn more and then what was your second question synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc it was just on the medical if theres anything to if you have any comments on the inquiry into the deferred interest and the medical cards that theyve also been talking about brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look id say first were very proud of the carecredit products that we offer in our view carecredit is not a medical credit card the vast majority of what we do there is elective health wellness spend so of the business is actually dental and pet care we worked very hard to ensure that the products are fair and transparent deferred interest is a product thats been around for decades we believe our practices are actually industry leading so one positive outcome would be just to level the playing field and bring other issuers kind of up to the standards and the things that we do every day so again very proud of the product its actually one of the products that we get the absolute best feedback on from customers mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc and then just if i could switch gears on to the credit side right your guidance for delinquency rates and i think youve talked about consumer being resilient delinquencies taking a little while to get back to prepandemic levels which obviously is a good thing but your guidance talked about it approaching prepandemic levels here in the next i guess six months what happens after that i mean your chargeoff comments for suggest you think delinquencies will stabilize at those prepandemic levels so maybe just talk about what gives you confidence that that will happen versus going through those pre pandemic levels and continuing to ph grind higher thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks mihir so i think the way we think about it and we watch vintage performance we watch how the rules kind of come into delinquency i just want to focus where we are today right when you look at average delinquency in the prepandemic period compare it to the apply that to the balances today our 30plus and plus are at and of historical levels and thats just been moving up slightly as we step through each of the quarters i think translating that thats about basis points lower than for 30plus days basis points lower for plus days so i think different than a lot of issuers we are not at that prepandemic delinquency formation yet albeit we are continuing to move closer to that in a very measured approach i think when you think about the loss rate and whats flowing to loss now were at of our midpoint of our underwriting average so we look at the formation today and say we feel good about where that is when we look at the vintages performances if i go back to and were not seeing real significant deterioration in those vintages theyre through their peak loss periods when we start looking at the pandemic level vintages and particularly in the and when a lot of issuers id say adjusted credit standards ph to kind of put it on those vintages for us are performing in line with our and vintages so we synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 dont see performance in there or in the back book if you call it that that says were going to be through our underwriting standards and target range for next year i think weve also been for the first time this year we did a little bit broader based actions and these were really around i think derisking the loss rate for next year and these are really around accounts that are either inactive or see significant score migration into nonprime so not significant its unlikely to have a material impact on sales or credit but just taking to what id say more appropriate prudent actions across the portfolio in addition to the idiosyncratic options that were doing so we feel good with the actions were taking we feel good about prism and the decision trees that are inside of prism in order to manage credit and adapt quickly to the environment and the vintage performances are in line with our expectations so that sets us up ph to how we perform well obviously be back towards the end of the year and give that ph beta guidance with regard to the full loss rate hopefully that gives you some perspective on how we think about it mihir mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator thank you well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so brian the second half net interest margin guide being in line with the first half maybe just talk about what is driving your updated expectations i think you mentioned betas could be higher im assuming now you no longer have rate cuts as per the forward curve maybe just talk about what youre assuming for betas and how do you think about the puts and takes or the trajectory of the margin over an intermediate term if rates are going to stay higher for an extended period of time brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks ryan so the betas we experienced in the first half of the year if i break it broadly between savings and cds in the savings were mid were low in cds and i think as we step forward into the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 second half the one thing that we noticed in the competitive dynamics as we exited out of the second quarter ryan was a little bit more price increases from competitors and i think that comes from a couple different places you have certain of the regional banks that are experiencing outflows relative to commercial deposits thats probably twofold one them running a little tighter on cash and two there is some id say risk mitigation strategies that some commercial firms are using so they are becoming a little bit more competitive for deposits you also see some of the big brickandmortar institutions who are trying to not have to raise their overall deposit rate but using online product in order to raise rates that dynamic really emerged id say late may into june so as we think about that mid low in our back half assumptions we have it moving up call roughly percentage points that youd see savings in the mid and you see cds around a i think as you think forward about deposits generally speaking assuming that the market remains what id say rational we would expect it to be fairly stable and then hopefully when you start to seeing rate decreases in the future that the betas will be ph so much like fashion and we can lower it i think when we think about the back half broadly speaking about net interest margin we should continue to see some tailwinds relative to the benchmark rates in the first half as they push through the floating portion of our portfolio in the back half we continued to see revolve rate increases most certainly if you expect the delinquency and losses to kind of come in line your revolve rate should push up there will be a little bit of offset there from reversals as writeoffs kind of rise but again some tailwinds as we come through there and then clearly some of the liquidity we built up in the first half will get deployed the second half will also be impacted digitally how liquidity portfolio plays out in some of the wholesale funding that were going to do in the second half both in the secured and unsecured market so hopefully that gives you a flavor for how we think about the betas and nim in the second half ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then brian were obviously waiting on a handful of potential regulatory changes in the coming months can you maybe just talk about what way if any you think this will impact the way that you think about managing both capital and liquidity on a go forward basis thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah ryan so again vice chair barr has indicated they will put out proposed rules around capital which again will have a comment period before a final rule is issued then a implementation period a couple of years out to fully transition in weve obviously been preparing have run different scenarios relative to the different outcomes when you think about financial changes ph versus the risk weighted assets or the potential implications from an operating risk perspective so i think weve been contemplating that relative to our capital plans we have been taking definitive actions i think its manageable for us i think if the fed decides to extend some of the longterm debt or tlac requirements based on the rules that exist today we feel like were in a good position were in surplus positions in those so i think we feel good about what potentially can come but obviously well look at rules well evaluate it and certainly well adapt our business and try to be smarter with regard to changes to the risk weighted assets and how we optimize it but we havent taken actions to date but well be closely monitoring and well certainly be addressing as you move forward synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan operator thank you well take our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you weve seen payment rates remain abnormally high for an extended period of time relative to pre pandemic levels and obviously loan growth is still fairly robust i mean do you expect or do you feel like there is a fundamental shift in consumer behavior right now relative to what you were experiencing in and just given that these payment rates remain very high and could remain elevated for an extended period of time just give us an idea if there was a shift in consumer behavior and what youre seeing today brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks thanks kevin for the question so when we look inside payment rate for a second there is a couple of different dynamics let me start with we dont see something today that says fundamentally the business payment rates for us or other issuers will be fundamentally different as we look out call it a year from now or so when i look underneath and break into segments what youre seeing is normalization back to prepandemic levels for the nonprime and lower credit grades and whats really kind of boosting the payment rate has been prime customers and super prime customers who have built up excess liquidity during the last couple of years and they continue to pay at a higher rate than they did prepandemic so we expect those people ultimately to normalize back to id say the prepandemic period were going to have to wait and see whether that happens the other dynamic that we have seen there has been a rise in auto pay which is a good thing for us so weve had about percentage point shift up to about of the accounts paying in auto pay and there that does help ph venture rate does help delinquency it does change a little bit the dynamics on the payment rate but thats not something that we think is going to have a material shift so again we think this is continuing to be part of a kshape recovery and part of the exit as the pandemic period for now until we get more clarity with regard to when the excess savings or money thats been accumulated during the pandemic totally burns off for those higher credits kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 okay and then maybe just a follow up on the growth the 10plus right implies maybe a slowdown from where we are do you anticipate an impact on spending and your sales volume due to this student loan restart and payments in october i know youve already made quite a bit of comments on the credit side but just give us an idea of your expected impact on the spending side brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah kevin so again we understand the population of people who ask student loans we understand the magnitude relative to the amount of loans that they have outstanding or what is in currently in forbearance and nonforbearance i think when we look at the population and the mix of that population first of all theyre very close to the fico range we have i think theyre about points different on a vantage score excuse me difference theyre within basis points in delinquency so they look like the regular book of those people weve underwritten in prepandemic that were making payments so we feel good about their ability to manage the financial situation so i wouldnt anticipate an impact on that when we think about purchase volume as we move into the back of the year and into early next year again i want to be clear i tried to mention early on the call kevin i dont think we see purchase on a dollar basis like decelerating it just goes back into we had a really tough comp last year for everyone as you saw this acceleration coming out of the backside of the pandemic which was pentup spending in demand both for goods and services so we feel good about the volume brian highlighted health wellness and digital which are really pulling the engine forward here and we expect that to continue kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you brian brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks kevin operator thank you our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions kevin really covered my primary topic but id love to discuss a little bit in terms of funding youve alluded to the fact that in the second half of the year you did look to the secured and unsecured markets im just curious realizing that you guys have not faced the issues that some financial institutions that had related to deposits whether the events for this year have caused you to at least take down your sort of target deposit ratio going forward brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks rick so no we have not altered our intended targets for the funding stack we feel very confident and very proud of our deposit franchise which i believe comprise of our funding as we look at the first half performance of this year we are positive on net flows every week including the weeks where there was the bank turmoil so we feel good about our ability to attract deposits and those deposits when you look at the vintages synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 weve grown the vintages in the first half of the year back so the customers are sticking with this us we continue to have high retention rate with regards to cd so the stickiness of having essentially retail deposit is really helping us as we move forward our willingness and desire to tap the wholesale market a very important part of our funding sources and i think to some degree when you go longer periods without being into those two markets it becomes more costly for people to willing to buy and then underwrite your name so having a presence in those markets and continuing to be active over time typically when we have debt maturities is going to be important we also have some maturities in the back half of the year relative to cds and things like that so to try to manage the betas were actually seeing the wholesale market in certain increments makes a lot of intuitive sense for us so again we feel good about the deposit franchise and that will be again 80pluspercent of our funding stack as we continue to move forward is our goal richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great hey brian thats very helpful as you think about the wholesale market can you talk a little bit in this rate environment and supply and demand is there what is the potential arbitrage in terms of funding versus the deposit market brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah rick for us its really about access i mean obviously credit spreads are little bit wider than we would like given some of the uncertainty and then well certainly given some peoples where benchmark rates may go even after the fed meeting later this month so we less look at it as an arbitrage more as how do i create a steady foundation and have the proper mix going forward and we think to some degree we continue to drive what we think is very good performance in the business show the credit performance here and show our ability to manage the regulatory environment that the credit spreads will tighten in over time but we dont look at it as an arbitrage we more look at it as how do i get a balanced funding need in order to really protect the balance sheet of the company and provide the appropriate liquidity under all situations richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc terrific that makes sense thank you very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks rick operator thank you well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning theres some news out there that theres at least one large portfolio out there for rfp big technology company and obviously walmart still remains influx im curious brian doubles if you could give us a sense of sort of where synchrony might stand for any larger portfolios or any other deal that might be out there synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure sanjay look i would say with a couple exceptions most of whats in our bd pipeline right now are smaller startup kind of de novo opportunities which were really excited about but obviously take more time to grow i think on larger opportunities obviously were very active there as well but i would also say thats where were extremely disciplined as well in terms of risk return making sure weve for the right balance the right alignment with partners i think thats just absolutely critical so i think youre always going to us steer a little bit more on small to midsize deals because we just hold the higher deals to or the bigger deals to a higher level of scrutiny in terms of risk and return and alignment with a partner sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc appreciate that and then i guess followup on some of the late fee regulation commentary i guess what im what i seem to be hearing is like there might not be a whole lot of move on the safe harbor amount that was proposed and im just curious like as we think about how the adjustments might be made its a pretty significant decline in that rate i guess what is your operating assumption as you move forward as you talk to your partners i mean is it as low as the safe harbor thats been proposed brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look we clearly think that this proposal has a lot of unintended consequences to consumers even the small businesses who rely on credit so we dont agree with we think that is not a deterrent its not an incentive to pay on time it will restrict credit to some customers it will make credit more expensive to many customers and so were very active with the rest of the industry in the comment letter process and we would certainly welcome a higher amount than the but with that said we have to prepare for the to go into effect as written right now and so thats kind of our base operating assumption we do think that if the cost calculation were designed differently we could certainly substantiate a cost higher than and so thats another angle that were pursuing here but we need to have revenue offsets that were ready to put in place to offset that because again our goal is to protect our partners here and continue to underwrite their customers just like we do today and so those are the discussions that are ongoing and those thats really where weve been focused for the last to months sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great well thank you so much for the color brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks sanjay operator thank you well take our next question from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 good morning regarding the credit actions that youve mentioned youre taking into given some migration on the nonprime side can you give us more color on what portfolios youre seeing this migration and what actions youre taking if you can give us a little more detail on that front thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks john obviously we cant get into specifics with regard to portfolio but i think broader based if you had a credit that was in the call it range and you saw a migration of basis points or basis points into nonprime we would look at that account before we used to wait and kind of look at it now we look at it in combination of other factors and decide immediately whether or not we want to reduce the exposure down to the balance so a credit line decrease or two if it has other attributes that we maybe more uncomfortable with we do a credit line closure account closure on that account and we do the same thing effectively in our inactive portfolio so these are ph or id say it this way its not likely to have a material effect next year ph its because these are significant movements into nonprime just because theyre not performing the way they would and they had a very significant movement at the time so again not broad based and we only draw the fact to be honest with you john because we said all our actions have been idiosyncratic these are what id say minor refinements that but again are more broader based if we see it anywhere in the portfolio were going to take action again its really more to derisk next year a little bit but not something thats likely to have a material effect john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it brian all right thank you and then separately on the expense front can you give us a little bit more color on your updated expense outlook i know you bumped that up a bit and mentioning growth in operating loss and so maybe could you help give us more color there maybe break it out and kind of set out what drove the revision brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure so when we look at growth i mean obviously the growth for us we raised the guide from the beginning part of the year we are seeing opportunities to invest more on the portfolio brian highlighted particularly in the health wellness in carecredit the ability for us to lean into that segment a little bit more we saw opportunities really to kind of grow ph layers with our allegro product or others that made sense for us to grow the portfolio so we are seeing growth weve added some incremental resources around that which we think drive ph it overall purchase volume has been a little bit stronger in the first half but again we expect to have some variable cost increases as youre thinking about more active accounts in the back half of the year as we service those accounts so from a growth standpoint those are some of the attributes and again ones in which were going to be if we find a good risk adjusted return we want to lean into this environment from a growth standpoint operational losses we the whole industry really benefited the last couple years ph as lot of fraud migrated to some of the buy now pay laters people who may not have had as robust fraud strategies in place so we saw abnormally low and again this is industrywide fraud relative to purchase volume that is migrating back to what i would say is a more historical level synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 this quarter we did have one particular incident from a partner who had an exposure which drove the cost up here a little bit but there was an rsa offset to it so again we just see more normal migration back to what it would be in the prepandemic periods not something that we look at and say this is going to become a challenge for the industry or for us individually just more the migration back to more normalized levels brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i think the only thing i would add to that is were clearly getting operating leverage and you saw a pretty good yearoveryear improvement in the efficiency ratio so thats a key measure for us that obviously were very focused on john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john operator thank you well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning this is jeff adelson on for betsy was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the rsa sustainability at these lower run rate levels relative to the longer term guide you have of the to and what maybe is taking that lower in the guide with the ncos going lower as well does that reflect something where maybe your retail partners are a little bit more willing to share in the higher opex youre seeing come through brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks jeff the rsa does incorporate expenses and so expenses would flow through to our partners as well as whats really impacting now is again some of the pressure you saw in the net interest margin from interestbearing liabilities cost they flow through to the partner as well so i think you combine that with credit normalization and you really get the effect that we have again the to we started the year and now the sic to is at the lower end of our longterm guide i think again the longterm guide has a sort of higher net chargeoff rate but higher margin ph what you share but again we look at the rsa and when you look at the performance when obviously we had much lower net chargeoffs and the profitability was higher the rsa was higher and now as you see a little bit of this interest bearing liability costs increased net chargeoffs increased ph suddenly higher expenses the rsa is synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 performing like it should and is designed to where its a little bit lower than expectation again we updated the guide to be sic to and we believe that that is for this year a good estimate of where the performance is going to be and well be back but again we feel good about the longterm guide there hasnt been any fundamental shifts in the sharing of economics with our partners jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just in terms of your new account acquisition profile i know you talked in prior quarters about the relative tightening you guys have been doing im just wondering if we could get an update on any incremental actions youve taken over the last three months and i know you already gave an update on the student loan repayment side of things just wondering if that factors into how youre underwriting people today and then maybe what youre hearing from your folks who are calling in on that repayment starting brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah jeff we havent taken any broadbased actions with regard to account acquisition we really look there at performance against riskadjusted margin and probability that falls on a partner channel basis so weve been making more refinement there but not broad based actions so we feel good about it you got to remember us as an issuer we get selected for credit versus others who do mailings and choose people to apply for credit so we have to be hopefully smarter at the time of that decision in which we can gather more data and use data from our partners usually data attributes bringing it to make that smaller decision so the other important point id say is during the pandemic period we really dont open and close the acquisition lever we made small adjustments as we see fit where relative to line assignments but we try to be consistent with our partners and really managing exposures to align so again no significant changes on account acquisition i think you can see that in the consistency of our new account origination both last year and through the first half of this year jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking my questions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys and thanks for brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey john synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc taking my questions how are you guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good john hecht q analyst jefferies llc first one is brian doubles i think you gave a little bit more color on the usage of bnpl and i guess the increased usage of the bnpl product in your portfolio it sounded like youre emphasizing in a sense as maybe a customer acquisition tool for some of your counterparties im just wondering with respect to that is it i guess is that the point now where it effects volumes overall and fee structures and margins overall and if so how does the impact of the bnpl product impact those metrics brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure john so i think just to take a step back i think just to reiterate what we think is this longterm strategy here is the multiproduct and theres real benefits there that our partners are fully realizing now in terms of how these products can complement each other right they dont cannibalize they actually complement each other and they provide choice to both our partner and their customers and i think thats really important so in some partners this may be a customer acquisition tool right where we bring them in on a buy now pay later product and then we upgrade them over time and do our revolving product and dual card and when we look at the lifetime value of that customer we can make that work we can make the economics work so i think thats kind of the power of this model is that you can make this more attractive to both us and our partners from an economic standpoint one of the things that weve talked about is weve seen a little bit of a shift in that through the pandemic you saw partners engaging in buy now pay later because they need to drive sales they want to bring in new traffic new customers and then they took a little bit of a step back in a higher interest rate environment so a lot of these products are actually really expensive and maybe there is a different model here and thats really the model that were employing which is for some customers and some purchases an installment loan make sense for some purchases a revolving product makes more sense and so it really is partner by partner in terms of the strategy that were employing but the good news is that we can customize that completely for the partner given the economic sharing and the arrangements that we have with them so we can really make this work in a number of different ways and customize it in a way that is economically attractive for the partner but also helps us balance the risk and the return john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very helpful color thanks and then brian wenzel i think you touched on this so i apologize for any redundancy but maybe quick color on the seasonality of q3 and q4 nim anything to consider there synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks john for the question i think as you think about net interest margin again some of the indiscernible as we begin to build assets going into the back half of the year plus some of the tailwinds relative to some of the benchmark rate increases you should see that that net interest margin tick up a little bit in the third quarter and then kind of flatten out in the fourth so but again i think shortterm i think youll see a little bit of a benefit from where we exit out of john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thats perfect thanks guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john operator thank you we have time for one more question from dominick gabriele at oppenheimer dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thanks so much for taking my question i was just curious about the debt collection fees that seems to be going up a little bit and i was wondering if there is anything we should read into within that line not just for synchrony but for the general industry when we think about net chargeoffs moving forward and i just have a followup brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so what i think about that product i wouldnt well first of all im not sure i can comment for the industry i think when we look at it this represents we primary originate this through digital channels and i see as we push more into digital channels you see a little bit more signup as people have the ability to really understand the products its terms and conditions and sign up for number and two i think as you see average balances increasing you then get a rate impact on the higher balance thats being protected so again a product that we feel good about the benefits that we offer to our consumers and we do it in a way thats transparent to the digital channels which obviously we pushed into in the last couple of years a little bit more heavily dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thank you and if we just talk about expenses a little bit the incremental expenses between the guidance numbers could you just talk about where youre kind of putting on the gas pedal is it marketing is it at customer acquisition or is it tech advancement how do we think about the incremental spend that drove the increase in run rate of expenses thank you so much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 yeah thanks for the question so i think when we think about where were putting on expenses first it is going to be in some of the employee cost as we look to people to drive strategic initiatives inside our health wellness platform and inside really our marketplace and some of the place where we are engaging with the consumer products so some of that requires head count in order to drive some the technology thats in there there clearly is a technology component that leans in there as we have contractors who are building capabilities that really enhance our customers experience and then you are seeing a little bit on the marketing lines we continue to lean in to some of the directto consumer businesses inside of health wellness as we try to promote the product to really drive the experience and manage what is a very difficult healthcare environment for folks as more costs are shifting towards them so its really across those three levers employee cost as well as technology and marketing and you will see again that normalization of operational losses as we move forward brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial and weve got a very disciplined approach on that we make sure that were getting the right return on those investments youre seeing that come through on the top line growth youre seeing the net effect of that operating leverage and the efficiency ratio as i mentioned earlier dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc perfect thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you brian j
