today and obviously right after the commentary the ir team will be at your disposal for any followup you may have and now please josé antonio josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you sergio good morning to everyone i hope you find well in the middle of this health crisis you and your families and relatives well this quarter has been a strange quarter weve been in a businessasusual till the last two weeks the last two weeks the covid19 outbreak has produced an unprecedented worldwide health crisis this is a health crisis that which is resulting in an economic crisis where the financial system i banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 think is more resilient and banks need to be an important part of the solution of the covid19 economic situation since the crisis started and with some anticipation we implemented in our geographies specific measures to take care of our employees customers shareholders and investors in order to protect them and to mitigate the economic and social impact i will talk more about this is in the last part of my speech starting with the quarter let me to follow how the quarter has the figures have behaved in volumes we grew significantly more at the end of the quarter than the beginning the loan book grew billion the pickup was basically in the latest part of march due to the drawdown of the committed lines by the large corporations deposits grew with a jump also in the second part of the month of march our customer digital activity reached record figures that is not strange and the growth in the group digital customer base doubled that compared with the previous quarters as regard results we recorded a provisional overlay of billion to cover the expected deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions arising from the health crisis as a result attributable profit was only million excluding this charge underlying attributable profit amounted billion higher than the same period in excluding the exchange rate impact in the current environment our credit quality and liquidity remained solid in all geographic areas you have in the numbers we continue to generate capital organically although the quarter had the growth in riskweighted assets has been approximately times the ordinary growth the consumption of capital due to growth indiscernible basis points in the quarter that were offset by the nondividend payment and the result as a result the core equity tier ratio at the end of the quarter was going to the geographic areas the resilience of the underlying performance and results is based in our diversification and scale by region we can see growth in loyal customers increase in loans and customer funds notably in the americas in europe profit and profitability were dampened by the already complex economic environment before the crisis due to low interest rates that become low in some geographies particularly in uk and then furthermore by confinement measures in many european countries in march north and south america on the other hand record strong profit growth and improved profitability going to the global business performance has been stellar we grew both in cib and wealth management at underlying profit in the quarter cib grew strongly particularly in the last few month ph as well in the funding needs of our customers these were reflected in a greater utilization of existing credit lines in march alone more than billion and increase in deposits wealth management insurance recorded also very high profits due to strong activity levels early this year which has slowed down at the end of the quarter due to the impact of the crisis in the market going to the pl well first thing to say exchange rates play a significant role has a negative impact of percentage points yearonyear if we take a look in our cost in euros would reflect the underlying operating trends we see customer revenue growing at with cost management and growth in provisions partly driven by higher volumes not just for the economic crisis that we expect from the health crisis as a result underlying attributable profit amounted as i said before billion higher excluding the exchange rate impact compare with the first quarter the nonrecurring charge of billion correspond to banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 the already mentioned in provision overlay and the remaining amount of restructuring cost that you have for more detail in the appendix with regard to the provisions and so now acknowledged by the iasb and other regulators and supervisors it is likely to be difficult at this time to know the specific effect of the health crisis and government and central bank support measures nevertheless in the first quarter based on the information on the environment at the quarter end and following the regulatory guidelines based on the expected deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions a provision overlay will be recorded conceptually reflecting the permanent impacts from the covid in the medium longterm arising from the expected worsening of the portfolios credit quality and avoiding the negative effects from profitability and volatility of the ifrs in the very short run in this environment of extremely high uncertainty the macro variables considered here are very much in line with those published by imf it is not exactly the imf on a countrybycountry basis but we had scenarios on a countrybycountry where the main items that affect the potential provisioning level going forward are gdp growth unemployment and house prices in our case also the car sales so its important how deep the recession is but its probably more important in accounting for how long the recession or the recovery or when the recovery comes going to the revenue in the first quarter customer revenue grew boosted by the americas as i said before and our global business net interest income grew due greater volumes combined with active management of deposit costs in an environment of falling interest rates in net fee income where our global business wealth management plus cib plus would account for more than of the group total fees generated we are confident that we will continue to deliver quality revenue growth i will further discuss this at the end of the presentation in the conclusions on costs costs lower in real terms in europe as we were indicating to you in our efficiency plan costs dropped significantly in all countries notably in spain minus uk minus this performance is comes from the efficiency plans we are executing in all this geography these enable us to obtain the expected synergies in the quarter to deliver our target for the year good management in north america where costs have not material change in south america of particular note was brazil with a fall in real terms this performance allow us to remain leader in efficiency among our peers with a efficiency ratio of our goal is to continue to making progress regarding operational environment and cost management adapted to the new environment we continue to pursue our targets as we indicated to you in our investor update credit quality while the quarter was in line with the traditional trends ph typically the npls coverage ratio and cost of credit remained basically stable with the same trends youve seen before on capital well we continue to strengthen our capital ratios in the quarter we once again generated capital organically combined with the favorable impact from the dividend measures taken resulted in an increase of basis point in the quarter the increase took place in a context marked by strong growth in riskweighted assets basis points in the quarter three times the ordinary increase mainly due to the higher lending and some market volatility that affected the riskweighting of the market positions on the other hand we had significant nonrecurring negative impacts as you can see in the slide basis point for corporate transactions that were already announced allianz elavon and the minorities of crédito consignado and olé consignado in brazil basis points from regulatory impact ph and model that banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 we were expecting is the majority of what we are expecting for this year and basis points from markets basically the marktomarket of the alco portfolios in mexico and brazil we are comfortable with our capital levels we maintain our to capital target in the scenario we foresee in the coming quarters with the aim of being on the upper side of the range finally and before handing to josé to comment the performance of our main markets i would like to highlight the resilience of our profitability ratios both in terms of underlying return on tangible equity and return on risk weighted assets as well as the tnav per share we remain about per share although suffer some impact from fx from the exchange rates i hand over to josé to elaborate about the different units and regions josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa thank you josé antonio good morning everyone as for the performance by region and country the americas increased their weight as a percentage of total profits to almost so we remained very well diversified as previously mentioned by josé antonio north america and south america grew at doubledigit rates where the performance in europe was impacted by the economic environment also our global businesses increased at doubledigit rates which helped to strengthen our local franchises taking a look at volumes we also had a positive performance in the quarter and covered our customers funding needs loans grew in real terms excluding exchange rate yearonyear mostly driven by south and north america which grew at doubledigit rates across all markets in europe growth with increases in all countries except spain as i will explain later customer funds were also up in nine markets deposits while mutual funds fell mainly driven by the drop in equity and fixed income markets in spain we had positive commercial trends especially in march when loans increased by nearly billion driven by smes and corporates this trend accelerated in april as the ico lines became available march was also a month of intense digital activity we operated most of the month with of our branches open and recorded the highest month in the number of digital customers almost million digital customers interacted with the bank the number of new contracts signed with digital signatures tripled accounting for more than of the bank total sales we had slightly lower net income although profit before tax was up as cost savings offset the drop in total revenue net interest income was down due to smaller alco portfolios and lower average earning assets in wholesale banking we are in line with our cost savings plan as josé antonio said delivering drop in costs nonperforming loans fell basis points yearonyear and provisions remained also under control in santander consumer finance the business was the first to be impacted by the health crisis first in china where as you know we have an operation and later in our units in italy and spain new cash sales in europe dropped in the first quarter while new lending in santander consumer finance fell only due to the strong performance in january and february in the last few weeks of the quarter and driven by the confinement measures the declines were sharper new lending in italy and spain was at to of the usual volumes so that drop of to in germany the banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 levels were to of normal levels and only the nordic countries remained are precrisis levels these declines were reflected in our results especially net fee income which fell on the other hand and due to the good performance at the beginning of the quarter net interest income increased costs rose due to the new alliances that we signed in the quarter and in the previous months excluding the change in perimeter they fell provisions were higher mainly driven by lower portfolio sales compared to the first quarter of last year the underlying profit as you can see here in the upper right of the slide it fell moving to the united kingdom volumes grew at good rates loans increased yearonyear in the quarter and driven by mortgages loans grew however in april new mortgage applications fell while the demand for mortgage repayment holidays amounted to around of the total mortgage portfolio revenue was affected by lower yields on new production and the continued as svr attrition also fee income was lower in part due to the reduction in overdrafts however we had a good performance in the pl costs were reduced by provisions fell and cost of risk remained at very low levels in brazil we kept our good momentum going which continued to show recurring profit generation even in the more adverse current circumstances current environment in volumes lending increased yearonyear with all segments growing notably corporate and cib consumer funds rose boosted by demand and time deposits up and yearonyear respectively both partly favored by foreign currency balances the depreciation of the real the return on tangible equity rose to following the increase in profits as you can see in the pl net interest income increased driven by higher volumes which offset margin pressures due to the mix effect the negative impact from the fall in the selic rate in the interest rates and the limit on the overdraft interest rates net fee income grew driven by payments comex and forex strong efficiency improvement yearonyear and the cost of credit remained stable in the quarter profit rose due to the strong fall in cost and provisions seasonally higher in the fourth quarter which obviously favors the quarteronquarter comparison and which more than offset the fall in net interest income due to lower spreads and net fee income to finish in brazil let me give you some color of the activity in recent weeks the acquiring business is down relative to precrisis levels cash withdrawals down and auto loans down to in the united states we had a strong volume growth in the quarter driven by both corporates and auto which do not yet reflect the falling activity recorded in recent weeks underlying attributable profit rose yearonyear with an adjusted return on tangible equity of backed by higher revenue and cost control as you can see on the page profit rose strongly quarteronquarter driven by seasonally lower provisions and costs in the first quarter in mexico loans and customer funds grew at double digit rates new lending to corporates and cib more than doubled in march compared to a regular month they went back to usual levels in the first weeks of april profits rose yearonyear backed by positive performance of income and lower noncontrolling interest costs were higher due to increased amortization and technology investments however efficiency improved by more than percentage point we also had good asset quality with all metrics improving compared to the fourth quarter of underlying attributable profit fell due to high gains on financial transactions in the previous quarter banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 and to finish i will make some quick comments on the corporate centre where underlying attributable loss decreased compared to mainly due to the combination of two things on the one hand in total income positive impact of around million in gains on financial transactions mostly coming from foreign exchange foreign currency hedging and two costs which improved yearonyear reflecting the positive impact from streamlining and simplification of our process carried out in previous quarters with these ill turn it back to josé antonio for the third section of the presentation thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé im going to elaborate basically on the actions were taking as a result of the covid19 crisis and im going to provide you the latest data available to give you the facts how the business is performing the data im providing to you in this section till the 22nd of april so starting with the how do we manage the crisis well this crisis has produced an unprecedented situation so the end of the first quarter was very very conditioned by the spread of the virus we had to manage the business in a total different way weve been monitoring since the beginning of the situation and activated all the necessary protocols to ensure business continuity we implement different measures taken into consideration also the authorities recommendations well the central banks have been acting and we take these measures in order to protect our stakeholders and to fulfill their expectations in our actions as the pandemic has evolved within each market the group has evaluated the situation and roll out measures in line with the specific needs of each country i would like to explain more detail how do we manage the crisis in crisis situation preserving our critical functions is key in order to provide service of high standards to our customers different action plans were implemented in different corporate areas and the counterparties in all the countries these actions plans covered the four dimensions included in the slide as prevention we follow large scale strategy to work from home currently more than people is working from home this was combined with keeping of our branches open and their employees working shifts our atms are fully functioning and most of our employees in contact centers are also telecommuting weve been proactive regarding internal and external communication to be as transparent as possible our aim is to keep our people customers shareholders and investors informed at all the times and providing advice if needed and we are monitoring risk and liquidity day to day while measures we took also measure for the community in which we are working one of our main priorities is to contribute to the wellbeing of the society as a whole we have implemented actions more reliable resources together with governments and institutions to help the society we already raised million to combat the pandemic some of the main initiatives are the creation of solidarity fund which already amounts million financed by reduction in remuneration and voluntary contribution from the bank employees weve been pretty active in spain one of the most affected countries in this pandemic the bank has donated several millions of protection masks respirators hospital beds and blankets and other things that were in high demand in these days in santander university we reallocated million to fight covid19 and by this local units supporting vulnerable groups with million we are working with third parties to facilitate donations and to help where this is needed and is required from us let me do to talk a little bit one area of the bank that has become crucial in this situation and this is the to has been key through this process allowing us to continue to running the bank and serve our customers remotely banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 we increased as you may expect our network capacity our bandwidth and increased the maximum number of users supported by the vpns you have the figures in the slide in q1 naturally as a natural reaction of the containment we had dramatic increase in the operation through digital channels we doubled the number of the increase in the digital customer base the digital sales increased significantly record quarter in number of assets the behavior of the group was more accentuated in some countries particularly spain poland and uk let me go to the figures already josé mentioned some of the figures in relation with the activity well we have also adopted measures to facilitate well our customer life during the crisis in all regions we provide payment holidays or deferral in most markets you have in the slide some figures temporary option to increase credit card and overdraft limits proactive support for vulnerable customers being proactive on trying to cover their needs reduction and suspension of some fees with regards to the payment holidays we have received applications and requests both relating to the government programs as well as the santander options on the slide you can see the number of applications for the largest customers and how they are well above million also you can see the weight sort of percentage of the total portfolio at as of of april this process is still underway as you can imagine and we think that we could end up affecting to of the mortgage book in europe to of the consumer book in europe and of the consumer book in the us another feature of this crisis is the governments in different countries have been particularly active in establishing programs for smes and corporates whose aim is to provide liquidity and credit facilities with favorable conditions for business facing hardship you have in the screen some of the programs established by the different governments in europe and the us and south america perhaps well im giving you the figures on the right side that related to spain spain has approved two tranches of billion each we were assigned with some of these guarantees lines we already approved operations billion of which billion are guarantee by the government the figure is spread across different segments where we reach all the sectors from large corporates to selfemployed we provide billion for the smaller sized companies across operations additionally we have granted we continue with the ordinary activity since the midmarch the ordinary activity has been progressing well according with our expectations in these context if we look at the loan book in different segments what you see is kind of a stable slightly up individualrelated business being mortgages and consumer is too early so at the end of the march i will provide you figures for the applications in april and smes and corporates you see in march a significant increase in the size of the loan books due to high demand and dropdowns particularly on the cib space where the book grew in the month of march billion so if you go to the trends josé mentioned some of them you have here in this slide the new mortgage lending how its evolving when we refer to new mortgage lending its payments actual payments that goes into the stock we were daily average the different regions well fell in mortgages while the applications and you have on the right side this goes from minus spain and uk to a smaller impact still in latin american business banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 in consumer lending you have the same figures there minus in new consumer lending and applications falling differently depending on the countries and regions and businesses this is the well its a summary of the behavior of the individuals visavis in the middle of this crisis when it goes to the corporates and cib we have a total different picture we see the opposite new smes and corporates lending grew already in march and much more in april due to the use of the government programs daily average went from million to million in february that is probably the normal level to close to million in march and more than billion daily average in april in cib ph happened the same was the massive drawdowns of existing credit facilities in march while in april the balance sheet is fairly stable i hope this gives you a sense of whats going on in the business in these days just to finish and to allow you to have time to ask questions you may have let me to share with you a couple of points we think the best way to support our shareholders is to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and our top priority as a way to help customers and communities and ensure profitability for the shareholders this is the best way to act in this scenario we are confident going forward because we have a strong starting point both in terms of balance sheet liquidity capital and in terms of pl our preprovision profit is one of the strongest in the industry finally our business model is very resilient and you have seen year after year in the stress test that we tend to be less affected because of the resilience of the balance sheet and we are activating management actions in revenues and costs that could mitigate the negative impacts that will be derived from the covid19 firstly we reiterate our billion cost reduction commitment well take additional action in costs including detailed analysis of our process in the new operating environment from the revenue side we are managing cost of funds to reflect the new interest rate environment the cost of deposits has been reduced over the past few quarters we still have some levers to continue this trend going forward and also on case by case we will try to design an efficient pricing strategy on the asset side to reflect the deterioration in risk profile however its too early to be conclusive about the macro and financial effect of the current health crisis as stated during the latest agm the mediumterm strategic objective will be reviewed once the economic impact of the crisis is clear in the meantime considering the high level of uncertainty and lack of visibility the situation recommend to be prudent and at this stage we are not in a position to provide a guidance with the levels of certainty required to conclude i would like to reassert that the pillars of the group strategy remain unchanged improving operating performance optimizing capital allocations to the regions and business that generate the related highest returns and accelerate the group transformation the group digital transformation thats all on our side and we will be ready to answer the questions that you might have thank you sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio indeed we have indiscernible available for qa so with this operator we will proceed with the questions banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen the qa session starts now operator instructions thank you the first question comes from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning thank you very much for the very comprehensive view of the current situation i have a few follow ups hopefully very short can you give us the breakdown of the billion provision overlay i cant reconcile with the divisions and the two followups to that is if i take the billion total provisions youve taken in the quarter should we annualize that i heard you josé antonio say that its very uncertain and youre taking imf but at what circumstances should we annualize it or should we not annualize could it be worse maybe some color there and the last point or related is one of your competitors or peers yesterday in their results were saying that their provisions were consistent with saying that of the payment holidays would ultimately result in being a default can you give us a color i know that provisions dont strictly work like that but can you give us a color of what do you think the payment holidays today ultimately how much of that could result in defaults based on your modeling what do you think about the quality of those payment holidays thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay so a couple of different questions alvaro to answer at this point at this juncture the breakdown of the overlay we dont have a specific breakdown we went by segments using a global scenario that is not exactly but is close to imf scenario and we dont have any specific at this stage a specific breakdown that i can provide to you on a country by country basis as i understood you were asking we made billion provisions in the quarter should this number can this number be annualized in this terms well i will say generally speaking my thinking of this and dont take it as written in the stone we are managing the scenarios we tend to look backward and to try to assess what has happened in different countries in the scenarios like this we have the real estate crisis in spain we have the recession in brazil in the other side if you look backwards in the real estate crisis in spain the group as a whole we were running in the cost of risk at this time you look backward in brazil when the recession hit the country and the gdp fell by the cost of risk went around the current a little bit lower than to basis points so those are the kind of figures that we have in our mind and while payment holidays you mentioned how much of this is going to be default well you need to look at the book so of our total book as a group are mortgages so we do not expect a significant default in the payment holidays related with mortgages the payment holidays the majority of the payment holidays related with mortgage have a financial advantage to the customer and make sense from the financial point of view of the customer to take these payment holidays and we think that many of them are taking because some of them because they are facing a difficult situation some others because its an advantage banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 having said that the main factors behind potential default here when i mentioned before gdp unemployment house prices the house prices how did they develop not in is more and is the most important factor in relation with potential default in mortgages so i do not expect in mortgages the majority of payment holidays are mortgages i do not expecting a bad outcome there in consumer we need to elaborate on country by country basis youve seen that and josé provide information and in the latest figures i provide to you in consumer in europe we have like four countries that the production collapsed and the other four countries half of the business still performing relatively well germany nordics and countries around these so we do expect different outcomes according with this kind of situation so particularly in the us indiscernible extensions that we provide you the number of extensions is business as usual the number of extensions we do in a normal month without having a crisis is in the region of a month yeah so now grew dramatically but this part of the business as usual and is difficult for us to assess how much is going to end up in higher cost of risk sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you alvaro next question please operator and comes from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you just a followup on the previous questions so you mentioned that the scenarios that you are managing are in line with the past crisis in spain you mentioned or the recession in brazil so this time the economic recession is going to be bigger overall not only in those countries but worldwide so what makes you confident that the cost of risk should not be bigger than what we do have been mentioning for those scenarios in past crisis so thats a general question and then specifically wanted to ask you about brazil you mentioned that the cost of risk in the past recession went up from to so at that time you went through the recession in brazil in a fairly good shape how do you expect now the brazilian bank to perform in this crisis given that you have grown relatively fast and how confident are you of the risk taken in the last few years thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you paco the first question why this time is not going to be bigger as you know provision is related with expected losses in a medium and longterm period what matters here is we have a new kind of crisis this time its a crisis that weve never seen for that reason is extremely uncertain the outcome but if you look at the different scenarios not necessarily on the imf well overall all the scenarios have a strong impact in and relatively rapid recovery in and so if thats the case the level of default is not that high so remember the last crisis when i spoke before in brazil the gdp fell and the recovery is still ongoing okay so three years later still not recovering this in spain the top to the bottom was around i think it took four five years to recover the kind of crisis we have in front of us is a crisis we do have a deep recession with very sharp duration sharp meaning months or maybe three months maybe six months maybe nine months depending on the kind of scenario you want to the kind of banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 v or the kind of u scenario you want to choose but in any case relatively sharp period of deep recession that follows a relatively rapid recovery immediately after this is not a very bad scenario if this happens for the cost of risk the longer the recession lasts without even if the intensity is lower the higher penalization i mentioned already in mortgages in which is not that what matters is not that much how deep the house prices fall immediately its how long it takes to recover the prices afterwards yeah so this is the general thinking on this and for that reason we remain relatively confident that if and its a big if at this stage the scenarios behave like the ones were seeing from the different economies and we have a relatively quick and rapid recovery afterward the scenario is workable i will say you said brazil well in the last crisis we had you said yes that we had a different portfolio that we grew a lot in the last couple of years its true well our franchise now is much better franchise than it was four or five years ago much more resilient with much higher profitability with much more capacity to take management action im fairly positive on the trends in brazil not really because of this is going to go up sure were suffering right now and you see in the nii the impact of the overdraft charges that were reduced significantly yes but the underlying trends are pretty good yeah so we continue to see our strength across the board is significant and we are i think we are well prepared to face the headwinds that were going to suffer in the coming quarters and we feel confident that were going to be able to match in the range i was telling you well not exactly dont take the numbers take the range as a potential outcome in the coming quarters sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks paco next question please operator thank you the next question comes from carlos cobo from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale hello thank you very much for the presentation carlos cobo from société générale the first question would be on the fx hedging policy if you could update how much of the currencies youve hedged and for how long that hedge is in place so if were fully seeing the impact already in q1 and what will be the phasing of that hedging rolling off and secondly if you could confirm that the billion cost cutting target for europe is being reiterated i think josé antonio said and whether you see any risk indiscernible coming from investment related needs in the context of the covid19 i would like to understand your thoughts around any room to beat the previous guidance on cost now or on the contrary to meet the targets do you now need to make an stronger effort and finally on capital if we should still maintain the yearend target or how should we expect the capital evolving from here thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 well i will take the second and the third question i will pass to josé the first one the fx hedging policy target for billion cost cutting in europe remains in place as reiterated im fairly optimistic you see the numbers in the first quarter fairly optimistic we are getting there probably in the short run were going to have as i mentioned before at the end of the presentation were going to take management actions management actions on revenues and costs and costs we have capacity to reduce the costs further from our targets in this environment yeah capital indiscernible capital as said that we also expect to remain inside the range of our target remember our target in capital is to and well expect to be in the upper side of the range at the end of taking into account all of that has been said in this presentation josé fx hedging josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa so in terms of hedging we have two different policies for capital for the capital ratio we fully hedged the capital ratio and we do that on a monthly basis so any exchange rate volatility does not affect the capital ratio directly and in terms of profits we hedge basically based on our expectations for exchange rate movements and to go into the details this year we have the mexican peso the sterling and the us dollar fully hedged and we have the real partially hedged so in the next few quarters if the exchange rates remain where they are today we will still see some negative impacts on our numbers sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos next question please operator thank you the next question comes from jose abad from goldman sachs please go ahead jose abad q analyst goldman sachs international hello good morning thank you very much for the presentation i have three questions first one is whether your billion postregulatory impairment taken today does this include the positive impact from the guarantees in the different countries that you operate the second question is on the profitability one of your european peers actually mentioned in a conference call which was taking place in parallel to yours that they expect to take zero profit from the government guarantee lines is this also the case for you in spain or in other countries and the last question is given that actually only in spain two tranches have been approved up to actually billion so youve granted a billion so based on these should you expect actually this to go up to potentially billion in cumulative incremental corporate lending until potentially q3 thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay when you are referring to the billion including guarantees these include guarantees do not include guarantees is because we are assessing the portfolio that was in our books as of 31st of march so and this new lending started in april so does not include government guarantees how much profits we expect to reap banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 understand the profit in the overall and in related with government guarantees i dont expect to make profits out of this so were going to get some revenues some cost of risks but overall is going to be difficult to make profits we may make some profits but not significant at all the government guarantees you extrapolate the as you know in spain the government established a kind of coupon for each bank based on the market share in the overall credit market and our case was i think or something like that and as you know we finished the assignment of the lines that were granted to us one week ago and we still have pending demand thats something that you may expect given the fact that although our participation in the overall credit portfolio the market share is our participation in the smes corporate space that is the ones who are demanding more loans in these days is in the region of for that reason we have a significant demand well its up to the government to go from the billion to billion they manage this and what i can tell to you is we have still demand pending for this kind of facilities sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks josé next question please operator thank you the next question comes from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yes hi here is sofie from jpmorgan when i look at your stage and stage exposure they fell quarter on quarter although very marginally but how much or what movement should we have expected in your stage and stage exposure if the eba didnt have the new rules out on forbearance would that have had any impact on your stage and stage exposures and then my second question would be clearly covid19 has different impacts in different countries but overall which countries are you most concerned about in terms of the outlook and which countries are you the least concerned about and then my final question would be if you could just remind us of your rate sensitivity given that we are seeing lower rates both in brazil mexico the us and so on so if you could remind us of your rate sensitivity thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well i will answer the first two questions i pass the third one the sensitivity rates to well josé do you want to take this one josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa the third one you want me to take it now josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa okay so the interest rate sensitivity to a drop of basis points is around million ph million more or less in spain very very small sensitivity in latin america but overall for the group its around million more or less josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa so there are two questions stage or stage its too early to go into this detailed analysis in the next we have plenty of moving parts the first one is the scenario that very likely were going to have more in the stage and stage second we have the government guarantees that are going to offset partially what goes to the stage and stage so the uncertainty is so high that at this stage i can elaborate very little on this the overall which countries will be more affected more than this country side will tell you exgovernment guarantees the segments that i see potential higher effect the first one is all the smes selfemployed small corporate segments on top of the traditional sectors that everybody has in mind yeah you know the sectors everybody speaks about the sectors yeah but by segments this is the segment that probably is going to be significantly affected the second one is some pieces of the consumer lending not necessarily cars probably direct lending much more than car the auto lending is the second i see a potential more impact and at this stage and i may be wrong because this depends on how price evolve i dont see a significant impact in the mortgage books because the interest rates are so low that affordability ratios and the loantovalue ratios in our books are relatively low interest rate is very low so affordability ratios are relatively high at this point you combine the affordability ratios with the loantovalue ratios i do not expect a big impact overall in the mortgage book sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks sophie next question please operator thank you the next question comes from ph adrian tang from credit suisse please go ahead q hi there this is ph adrian t from credit suisse thank you very much for taking my questions three followup questions from me on the billion provision overlay can maybe provide us some key sensitivities around your base case scenario you mentioned gdp unemployment and house prices is the key variable just to judge if these are getting better or worse what we could expect on the capital can you maybe help us think through the potential impact you expect from the risk migration given the increasing pds and lgds and then the third one just a clarification thanks for the disclosure on the mortgage and consumer payment holidays on slide can i just clarify that youre still accruing net interest income on all the loans in all geographies on these thank you banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well the billion the question was exactly josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa the sensitivity josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa the sensitivity to the base case well this billion comes from the combination of two scenarios one in scenario that is kind of ph b scenario that is relatively mild and one scenario that we call internally ph u scenario that is much much worse and overall much it takes longer to recover some of the variables that are behind these expected losses particularly as i mentioned before house prices so if house prices lets say fall and it takes more than three years to recover the impact is much more intense than if we have a stronger gdp fall in the short run and a recovery immediately after than otherwise will be the case so these are the the base case we are using is a combination of ph b scenario with ph u scenario that give us and i mentioned before kind of imf on a countrybycountry basis in some countries its more intense than imf in some other this is less but overall as an average we are basically there capital impact of the rate immigration remember we have of the portfolio is standard model the other is mortgages that rate immigration is not significant and this rate immigration affect barely to of the portfolio that is related more with the kind of cib business and some corporate so the impact should be relatively minor yeah so were going to have some but relatively minor in our case given the fact that the standard model still plays a big role in our capital numbers that weve been telling you and the third one is consumer the third one was sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa foreign language josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa holidays payment holidays if we accrue if we dont accrue we accrue in the majority of the case although there are some cases that the government initiatives the payment holidays force us not to accrue for one month two month or three month its not significant but it has some effect some in a limited number of cases because it doesnt apply to the overall portfolio thats applied to specific people that has a very very low income and with vulnerabilities that we cannot accrue interest but this is really really minor what this has in the other cases is the financial effect because we are translating interest into the future principal payments and that has some financial advantage for the borrowers yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from marta romero from bank of america please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you very much ive got three questions the first one on capital youve mentioned you aim to be at the upper end of your to target for fully loaded core equity tier however given that is kind of a lost year dividends are more or less banned and you still have legacies from the previous crisis would it makes sense to clean up as much as possible in ie would you be willing to bring your fully loaded core equity tier just in line with the mda thresholds of around after ph cib the second question is on your alco strategy how attractive do you think current sovereign yields in spain italy and portugal are are you willing to increase your exposure to the periphery do you believe the ecb backstop will be effective and hence it makes sense to load up on periphery bonds today and finally on santander consumer finance thank you very much for the call color you provided on recent activity levels how that translates into revenue outlook for the rest of the year and just to be on cost of risk youve given us lots of details and youve tried your best of course given the uncertainty but where do you see the costs of risk in santander consumer europe progressing for the next three years thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa okay so hello marta its josé ill take the first question im not sure i understand what youre saying about legacy issues from the previous crisis in terms of capital beyond the ifrs transition period so we can take that offline and discuss that but i dont think we have any legacies whatsoever coming from the previous crisis in terms of capital having said that you have to remember that we no longer have a capital conversation buffer in the uk which gives us basis points so the capital requirement has been lowered by at least basis points we have fully reached the at1 and tier buckets so any new issuance of at1 we do will go against p2r so if we issue in the market this year we will create more space on a higher mda and we would expect to demonstrate that our capital continues to be extremely resilient even in the worstcase scenarios in the different stress tests that have been conducted by the eba and the ecb weve always come as the least affected bank those were paper crises this is a real crisis but what we are saying is that our capital which i would agree that it takes time for us to build up capital because of our model our model also its extremely resilient when withstanding the shocks of crisis and we will demonstrate our capital will withstand this crisis again extremely well banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay the second question was related with alco strategy yes why not if we plan to buy spanish italian sovereign bonds in order to hedge the current accounts well this alco meets monthly but i can tell you we are probably at the lowest level in the last six seven years in the portfolio of alco in you are referring to the parent company we had the lowest level in the last probably six seven eight years i dont know for a long time finally revenue outlook for consumer finance this is going to have an immediately affecting the fee income you saw at the end of the first quarter we mentioned because fee income in the new origination plays a significant role there fee income coming from the launch and fee income coming from insurance business that we do have the origination this is going to be the main effect in the very short run you mentioned the cost of risk i already elaborate that we do expect much a significant higher impact we are relatively positive in auto lending and we expect higher impact in direct lending and direct lending well the biggest portfolio is germany and somehow spain but its smaller size nordic countries and naturally those are the portfolios the business is twothirds auto lending onethird other business credit cards and direct lending and this one third is where i do expect higher cost of risk and the portfolio by countries is well germany is the largest second is spain italy we have some lending although its guaranteed by the payroll since the probability of default is relatively low on nordic countries where we have credit cards and direct lending where i do not expect a significant increase going forward you mentioned in the medium term well in our scenario in the medium term the cost of risk will go up but not in a dramatic way sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks marta next question please operator thank you the next question comes from ignacio ulargui from exane bnp paribas please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas yes hi good morning just have two questions one on the capital coming back to how do you see the capital evolving in the coming quarters i think that the has been a bit of a trough of the year and its quite uncertain but if you can give us some color on how do you see the capital moving onwards the second one is on the government reactions in latin america has been a bit lower than what we have seen in europe and in the us how do you see this impacting the banks there particularly interested on your thoughts in brazil and mexico thanks josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa can i banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa what josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa the capital josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa in the first quarter we had as you could see basis points from regulatory and accounting charges and basis points from perimeter changes we wouldnt expect to see significant perimeter changes in the coming quarters and there may be some regulatory charges but they are not going to be of the nature and the amount that we saw in the first quarter so going forward i would expect or we would expect the capital to evolve in line with our capital generation which we think could still be in the region of basis points per quarter on average josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay government reactions your question was if the reaction of brazil and mexico was lower well this is probably the european view you take into account how these societies where is the in economic terms where these societies in economic terms are with the informal economy playing a very big role and the resilience of the population in terms of the resilience to a confinement of these populations is much much lower than it is in europe you will understand a bit better why in some countries theyve been reluctant to take strong measures of confinement having said that they are taking measures and if this is going to affect our the performance because this slower reaction of the governments well it will depend basically the kind of actions they will take in protecting or guaranteeing the lending to the smes having said that you take the figures the figures are pretty small when i look at the sme booking in mexico that in our case is more than already has guarantee from the government from a institution called nafinsa more than of the book we already bought guarantee for this book at the origination time when the book was originated and you see brazil the size of this book relatively small so the governments are reacting in brazil there is plenty of measures that the government and the central bank already took and we feel comfortable there and well in relation with how they are handling the health crisis i am not an expert on this there is plenty of controversy about how to manage this even in the europe and the states there has been controversy about this im not in a good position to make you a an analysis of this yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 sergio gámez toro a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you we have time for one last question please operator thank you the next question comes from fernando gil de santivañes from barclays please go ahead fernando gil de santivañes dornellas q analyst barclays investment bank hi good morning thank you for the presentation just a followup question on the alco portfolio just to get to the strategy on the alco portfolio i see that the volume has come down quite significantly in the quarter what you will expect in terms of sales and the disposal on the tltro programs on the ecb this is one and the other one is on rwa inflation i mean you have disclosed on these pages and the increase in loans in april so far how does this effect on the rwa makes an inflation going into quarter two thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa so the alco portfolio sales well this depends on the decisions related with ph interest rate with regard to the size of the portfolio well its up to the alco to decide if we want to increase or not and i cannot elaborate on this on tltro well the role of tltro depends very much on the overall liquidity in the market at this stage the overall liquidity is quite good our liquidity position in fact our lcr since we started the crisis had been going up the deposits are growing fairly rapidly stable deposits coming from customers and the liquidity position is as i said is improving almost on a daily basis riskweighted assets inflation because the lending i show you there the lending goes to corporates and cibs the lending go into smes the majority of this has kind of government warranties so the weighting is very very low risk maybe in the region of to depending on the country but this is very low so i dont see that much inflation there the other growth that we had was in cib that was already in the first quarter we do not expect another jump in the second quarter in cib companies drawing the committed line so we expect a more normalized behavior so overall with the individuals i dont see in this quarter coming back to normalized levels in europe and with the majority of the lending go into smes being warranted by the government and with cib being incredibly stable i dont see a particular inflation in riskweighted assets or some come from ratings some of your colleagues have said before its not that important here the government guarantees plays a role unfortunately origination with individuals is fairly low so overall i do not see and we will stick targets as josé said before so josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa and i think we have very relative to all this very limited market risk so banco santander sa san corrected transcript q1 earnings call 28apr2020 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yeah thats right josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer head of finance division banco santander sa okay so that will also not impact our riskweighted assets significantly sergio gámez toro global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa we need to leave it here guys thanks very much for your time today obviously myself and ph natalia i think will be at your disposal for any followup from now thank you keep safe josé
