this morning we reported third quarter net income of million earnings per share were a share and our return on average common equity was the quarter included a million pretax charge related to a corporate action processing error the issue was identified internally by our corporate actions team and to put the impacted clients in the same position as they would have been if the error had not occurred we executed open market transactions which resulted in the loss you can see on the bottom of page equity markets particularly domestic us markets performed well during the quarter recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels and both the sp and eafe local had strong sequential performance based on those calculations its worth noting that on a yearoveryear basis the eafe local index remains negative which creates an unfavorable impact to our fees compared to the prior year as shown on this page average onemonth and threemonth libor rates continued to decline during the quarter lets move on to page and review the financial highlights of the third quarter yearoveryear revenue was down with noninterest income up and net interest income down expenses increased the provision for credit losses was in the current quarter net income was down in a sequential comparison revenue declined with noninterest income up and net

down compared to last year and down sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were up from last year and sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the quarter up year overyear and down sequentially the increase compared to a year ago was primarily driven by higher volatility while the sequential decline was impacted by lower volumes and lower volatility the remaining components of noninterest income totaled million in the quarter up compared to one year ago and down sequentially securities commissions and trading income decreased compared to a year ago and was down sequentially both yearoveryear and sequential declines were primarily due to lower interest rate swap activity and referral fees other operating income increased compared to the prior year and was down sequentially the increase compared to the prior year was driven by higher income related to a bankowned life insurance program as well as higher miscellaneous income primarily associated with a market value increase in the supplemental compensation plans this higher income resulted in a related increase within the other operating expenses the sequential performance was impacted by a lower market value adjustment for a seed capital investment relative to the prior quarter partially offset by lower visa swap expense net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million in the third quarter down from a year ago and down sequentially northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 lets look at components of our trust and investment fees on page for our corporate institutional services business these totaled million in third quarter and were up yearoveryear and up sequentially custody and fund administration fees the largest component of cis fees were million and up year overyear and up on a sequential basis the yearoveryear performance was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and new business partially offset by unfavorable markets the sequential increase is primarily driven by favorable currency translation as well as favorable markets

waivers within our cis investment management fees assets under management for cis were billion up yearoveryear and up sequentially the growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets client flows and favorable currency translation the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation securities lending fees were million in the quarter down yearoveryear and down

earning assets averaged billion in the quarter up versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year the net interest margin was in the quarter and was down basis points from a year ago the net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower shortterm interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was down average earning assets increased on a sequential basis while average deposits were up the net interest margin declined basis points primarily due to decline in asset yields as securities and loans repriced to lower interest rates turning to page expenses were billion in the third quarter and were higher than both the prior year and prior quarter expense during the quarter included the previously mentioned million charge excluding the charge expenses were up on both the yearoveryear and sequential basis compensation expense totaled million and was up compared to one year ago and

sequential basis higher salaries driven by unfavorable currency translation and staff growth were mostly offset by lower incentives employee benefits of million was up from one year ago and up northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 sequentially the yearoveryear increase was primarily related to higher pension expense the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher medical cost outside services expense of million was down on a yearoveryear basis and up sequentially the yearoveryear decline was driven by lower costs across a number of categories including technical services consulting thirdparty advisory fees and data processing partially offset by higher subcustody expense and brokerage clearing costs the sequential increase was due to higher technical services costs thirdparty advisory fees consulting and subcustody related costs equipment and software expense of million was up from a year ago and up sequentially the year overyear growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization as well as software support costs the sequential increase was driven by increases in software support and equipment maintenance costs occupancy

advanced approach both unchanged from the prior quarter our tier leverage ratio was under both the standardized and advanced approaches during the third quarter we declared cash dividends of per share

our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise theyve come to expect our competitive positioning in wealth management asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace thank you again for participating in northern trust third quarter earnings conference call today mike mark lauren and i will be happy to answer your questions operator please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 question and answer section operator absolutely operator instructions and first from jefferies we have ken usdin jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey thanks good morning guys i just want to follow up on the whole side of rates so good news that nii was down better than the original guide and i was just wondering if you can update us on what your thoughts are as far as the outlook for nii and at what point do you expect nii to get close to just flattening out is that sometime early in or how can you help us think through that thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah first of all i think its important for people to realize that there are components to the securities portfolio that are longerdated and there are securities we bought in that arent going to mature for another two three four or five years and so its going to take a long time to get this whole portfolio repriced that said at this point of overall earning assets have been repriced on the new yield curve and if you were to break it down even a little bit farther from that you can look and see that effectively all of the floating rate assets have been repriced of the loan book has been repriced and about of the securities book has been repriced and so i think the best way to think about it from what you can see is it from here about to of the overall earning asset base is going to reprice every quarter and so weve gotten through most of it and if you think about how aggressively we had to get through going from the first quarter where everything was on the prior book to then in the second quarter and now this third quarter movement weve got the vast majority of it done thats why we think the flattening were at that point now its just trickles from here but its not going to be flat for a long time as those longerdated securities play through ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and i guess just relative to your prior comments just want to give you the opportunity just level set us on what your expectation would be for nii versus third q jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah i appreciate that and i do think that well first of all ill answer the question the way we look at it now and it comes back to that dynamic of about repricing you could say its going to be down give or take point and i think thats what you should expect from the math at this point that said now that were at the point where so much of the book has been repriced the movement in nii from here is going to be driven more by what happens in the business and more by what happens in loans and what happens in the deposit book and how that northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 stays on and frankly our confidence level in reinvesting that into not just cash at central banks but into higher yielding assets and so from here its going to be much more business driven ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks jason jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks ken sure operator and we have glenn schorr with evercore jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there thanks so definitely not the norm for you guys but i think everyone has a little bit higher sensitivity to issues indiscernible so i was going to ask just for a little more color on the corporate action item was this a manual issue what have you done to rectify and has there been ph mras outstanding related to this i think from the qa back and forth precall was about that so i figured wed just address it thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure i appreciate it glenn so first of all i just want to provide a little bit of context on this group for people that dont know it well and how an item like this occurs and i think its important to understand with trillion in assets under custody or administration the security services group is processing literally millions of transactions a year weve got errors in the group on a consistent basis and they total somewhere between million million a quarter on average thats typically what we experience there and theyre accounted for consistently in the other operating expense line on the income statement that you see and so the event itself is not unusual its the dollar amount and if we focus on that a little bit we think over the last years weve actually never had a loss cumulatively in a quarter to even get to million and if you look back even on the years weve never had a full year that amounts to this level of a loss and interestingly this quarter in and of itself from a volume perspective of losses it was light and even the other items added up to a less than normal level it was at the bottom end of that kind of million to million range and so then if you ask what have we done you can imagine the first thing we do is unpack the situation and once were confident that theres been a mistake we did everything we needed to do in order to make our clients whole we did that and then at that point we looked at the processes identify ways to improve even a process we felt strongly about but we identified ways to strengthen it we put those in place and at this point we move on northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 from an ph mra perspective you know we wouldnt be able to talk about that at this point if it were even if that had even been surfaced but obviously we took this very seriously i think its important to note this is not out of the normal course of servicing trillion in assets in terms of the event it was really the fact that we had a very large exposure within it that was unusual glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay cool maybe indiscernible on something that relates to the balance sheet jason the other securities line is up yearonyear and its almost the biggest part of earning assets now the footnote talked about community development investments but could you just expand a little bit more on that because its such a larger part and its growing more what benefit do you get from that what kind of yield pickup and should we expect to see more of that thanks so much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure just before you go on mute i want to make sure we answer your question really specifically so youre talking about the increase in the securities portfolio the kind of billion billion is that where youre looking michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp i think most of that growth came on that other securities line so if we address we addressed the growth in securities yearoveryear i think thatll jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so in general the group glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp were you going to add a clarification glenn or glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi nope no you got it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp indiscernible northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi the other line in the securities line on the balance sheet thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so in general the treasury group is always looking for opportunities to lean out a little bit from just cash and we feel confident and therell be types of investments that are shortterm where its not cash but theyre items where we pick up a little bit of yield and so it could be shortterm indiscernible it could be other shortterm instruments where we pick up a little bit of cash a little bit of yield without taking too much incremental exposure and so theyve been looking at that in different ways and part of it i think we talked last time about the fact that part of this nii journey is going to be not just the size of the balance sheet but when we felt confident that we could step out of central banks and so as the treasury groups looking to do that theyre looking for not just these traditional what are we going to do with twoyear threeyear fouryear securities or mortgagebackeds but other items that can stay short but still pick up a little bit in yield and so thats not necessarily something you should see as a longerterm trend its something that as we did this initial step out we saw opportunity glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi great thanks so much appreciate it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys thanks good morning so maybe just a quick clarification at nii first so here youre on the kind of to decline in nii from here as the securities book reprice does that include any mitigation efforts to offset the rolloff rollon dynamics or thats really kind of like a gross number and then there are things you could do to help mitigate the remaining pressure albeit its obviously somewhat small which could get you to more of a kind of flattish nii from here jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well the answer is its very much just looking organically at the amount of this in the book so that doesnt include any other strategic items thats just the math of whats rolling off from here that said i do want to northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 caution people even though net interest income is down significantly obviously were not going to be looking to have dramatic changes in our strategy or our risk profile to think about offsetting the decline in rates and so were constantly thinking about optimizing the investment book and we continue to do that no change in our risk appetite at all but the to a quarter is very much just the math of what exists in the book right now absent any other things that we would be so you shouldnt be thinking thats exactly whats going to happen over time there are other things were thinking about in terms of the securities portfolio other things we can do with the balance sheet but those were things we were contemplating before rates came down frankly alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats very clear thanks for that my bigger picture question kind of revolves around fees and this has obviously been a pretty volatile year with respect to both markets and new business and volumes et cetera maybe help us level set what has been the organic fee growth in the business maybe kind of over the last months given your comments around strong pipeline and sort of building momentum in cis maybe help frame what that kind of organic fee growth could look like over the next months and then specifically i was hoping you guys could also hit on the global family office business that revenue has been kind of flattish for the last four quarters despite a pretty significant growth in assets i know theres a little bit of lag there but still feels like the fees are lagging lag in the asset base so kind of bigger picture question but if you guys could hit in all that thatd be awesome thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so if i start on cis i think the weve separated into two different buckets there interestingly one is that there has been significant growth thats come in the investment management fee line and thats come from very good collaboration between the asset management business and cis and a lot of work we did in the last couple of years setting up the liquidity business to be able to take on assets so im going do this at the at the corporate level but a lot of these assets apply to cis but if you go back to last year to the beginning of this year the liquidity business had billion in aum and now were close to billion billion very significant growth bigger than whats happened in the industry and so thats led to good organic growth in the business as a result of good collaboration again not of those are in the cis business but the vast majority of it is the other aspects of cis as you just get to the traditional custody and other asset servicing type activities interestingly the organic growth this quarter was not great it was positive but it wasnt great they do feel stronger about the pipeline that they have indiscernible business and part of that is a result of the fact that there were a lot of prospects that we won that delayed implementation partially because of covid but still very high confidence level thats going to be onboarded in fourth quarter or first quarter and so we see good opportunity set to bring on that business in the next couple quarters that said the growth in the money market mutual fund business its been its been great but it has flattened out at this point and so its good diversification in the business to sometimes get growth coming from the investment management side and sometimes from the other northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp this is mike i mean im going pick up for jason while he gets the chance to get a sip of water alex so i think importantly longerterm that again we continue to see the opportunity to grow at a higher organic growth rate having said that as weve always said its critical that thats profitable growth for us and so that were doing it in a way that is coming with operating leverage and fee operating leverage now with the change in the rate environment that dramatically impacts your ability in the shortterm to get the operating leverage and so as a result it focuses us on ensuring that that growth does not come with the requirement for significant resources so looking at the expense side of the equation and just making sure that we keep those in line in this type of environment and that the growth is high quality scalable growth for us so thats on the asset servicing side and jason mentioned asset management just to close off on wealth management again as you mentioned this has been an unusual year and so weve had to shift our sales and new business strategy as a result and i would say that im very optimistic on the long term prospects for that but it has in this interim period has caused some additional volatility in the normal sales pattern that we would have so longterm very positive but to your point theres some bumpiness that weve had this year that we havent had in previous years mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp alex this is mark and i could comment on the gfo asset growth i think youre seeing the growth has stepped up in the second quarter cant get into a lot of specifics there but that type of client that type of segment for us those clients can move pretty large concentrated asset holdings on to our custody platform and thats what the majority of the increase was in the second quarter theres not necessarily a corresponding noticeable increase in fees with that just because of the nature of the single holding that we might be having on our platform for those clients alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks everybody for tackling all that thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks alex operator next up from morgan stanley we have betsy graseck jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning i have a couple questions on the capital ratios i know you typically said it was a pretty nice cushion above your regulatory minimums and above what your management buffers indiscernible northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 obviously in this period with no buybacks capital ratios improving even further could you give us a sense as to how youre thinking about utilizing that excess capital in the event that cessation on buybacks continues is there anything that you might want to discuss about how you could be using that capital outside of buybacks weve seen some acquisitions in the space recently on the asset management side wanted to get your sense on that if theres anything to do there thats the first part of the question thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good all right ill try it and see if i got my voice back the good news is that mike and i talk about this a lot so if i dont hes going to well definitely be on the same page on it so im going to start with indiscernible a little bit betsy but i think theres four components to how at least how we think about how we deploy capital and how we what capital levels we maintain the first is we have very good genuine discussions with our board about it and thats not to say that theres any tension there theres not at all were completely aligned but we also want to make sure that were not being presumptuous in saying where we want capital levels to be without having good conversations with them so it really does truthfully you start with that discussion and then secondly we think about capital on an absolute basis we want to have good cushion relative to where we need to be from a regulatory perspective the third is we look very closely frankly out the side view mirror and we look at things on a relative basis when we talk to clients and prospects they care and we want to be able to reflect its part of our overall value proposition that weve got strong capital levels and we have to be able to evidence that on a relative basis and the fourth maybe most instructively given the fact that the stock price has come down is thinking about things on a returns basis and so we think about that deployment of capital not just do we take capital up or down but what types of returns are we getting for it and there we have to compare what returns are we getting by investing in our own stock effectively and that has to do a lot with where we think things are from a priceto book perspective and how its trading and what we think and secondly what opportunities do we have to reinvest organically in the business and then third were looking at what examples there are where we can invest nonorganically outside and so weve talked about the fact that were very open and id say particularly in the wealth management space where it is difficult to have organic growth we feel very strong about the franchise and we feel like our ability to maintain a high quality client base is very strong if we were to bring that in betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so when youre talking about wealth management youre talking about teams firms portfolios is there any nuance to that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah the teams i think is harder i think those tend to be first of all culturally its not super consistent for us to do something like that for various reasons and happy to talk about it a little bit more i think firms where youve got more of a sense of scale thats been there but theyre maybe not at the scale that we are and we can bring that in and we think about our different groups almost as large teams and we think about the offices we have the billion in assets you split that between the offices we have and you have a team of billion billion northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 billion so something of that size or up to billion is kind of a couple of teams from our lens but extracting a team out of another firm is not something that we have tended to do and so thinking about an organization an established organization with a client base but with a leadership that hasnt been able to develop a succession plan in place or they think it just might be better to go to the infrastructure of a larger organization you think about the scale we represent at that asset level we can be a good solution for firms that dont have that succession planning in place betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and what im hearing in your answer is wealth management over asset management is that fair jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp to the extent there are opportunities in asset management its a little bit more nuanced weve done some things there quietly more small that have been extremely consistent with our strategic desire to do more intermediary distribution and so we look closely at those as well i think the distinction might be probably a little bit of a higher bar right now to do something in size at the asset servicing side of the business betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then what if the fed does lift the restrictions on buybacks maybe you could give us a sense as to how youre thinking about how you would manage the capital in that scenario in terms of the pace that you might start buybacks back up at and how quickly you want to get back down to the capital ratios that you think are most efficient for your business model jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp mike can you answer it michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so betsy i think jason laid out the framework so i wont go into that but that is the framework that we would apply should the fed lift the restrictions and well see but prior to the pandemic we were repurchasing our shares and so it depends on that broader environment that we would lay over with the regulatory constraints so i would hope that to the extent that the fed removes the restrictions thats also an indication that the environment is relatively favorable which will put us back in a position similar to the beginning of the year where we were both able to and were repurchasing our stock betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 operator our next question will come from mike carrier with bank of america jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp mike michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning thanks for taking the questions first you guys have been focused on both investing in the business but also doing a good job on driving efficiencies in operating leverage the longer were operating in this workfromhome backdrop im just curious if you found additional areas of potential efficiency whether its an area of real estate or other areas that could drive that longerterm jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp this environment it has been very obviously its made everybody take a step back and think about that we have frankly there are things that were accelerating the business i mentioned super quickly in the opening comments that were on a real estate strategy journey right now we look deeply at that just a couple of months ago kind of in the midst of this to say how does the healthcare crisis influence that strategy and there are elements of it that it accelerates and there are consolidations we were thinking about that frankly were saying we can do that faster and then there are other things that we were not considering before that this endeavor makes us consider and i tell people kind of jokingly a year ago i did not know how many square feet we had off the top of my head and now i do and i know where they are and i know how much were paying per foot and so were talking about that element a lot to try and think about what does real estate look like in the future not just domestically but internationally and there are a lot of creative things we can do to try and be more efficient and try and leverage the technology that weve invested in into our partners in order to decrease reliance on square footage frankly and that also leads to areas of saying how we become more resilient and how do we think about resiliency with our workforce overall and weve had to make them more technologically equipped in order to be resilient and that adds flexibility as well obviously in very creative other ways the way we think of our resiliency centers and other things like that michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thats helpful and then jason you mentioned in the past that loan demand will be a key driver to nii going forward and weve seen fairly divergent trends across the industry its still fairly weak in loan demand but pockets of strength within the wealth area so just wanted to get an update on your front in terms of the demand that youre seeing across the business jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 yeah its interesting you cant see it from the financial statements but loans are actually a tick up within september even and that surprised us when you go back days ago i think everyone felt like we were going to see balance sheets come down we thought liquidity we thought cash was going to come down deposits are going to come down we thought loans were going to come down but our balance sheet on average was up in the quarter and even there its not just the clients are holding more deposits but loans were held in and so it does seem like some of the loan demand we have is coming from clients that are saying they want to be ready to do things to be more active if they see opportunities come up its unclear whether or not that will actually happen whether or not the opportunity come or whether or not theyll actually pull the trigger on it but thats certainly been the case that theyve held in in terms of loan volume and weve been talking recently about the fact that liquidity in general is a big component of what we do with our clients and so if you think about liquidity more broadly as clients wanting to find safe high quality places to park their cash and shortterm assets they view our balance sheet as strong and weve talked about the fact that our money market mutual funds very strong investment performance theyre at size our treasury funds are billion to billion and so various appealing places even for very large institutional investors to invest and then on the other side clients know as theyve worked with us we understand their asset composition well and so we can be a thoughtful lender in terms of how to structure things in the most efficient way for them michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thanks a lot jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator moving on from deutsche bank we have brian bedell brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning a couple indiscernible questions to get us out of the way just if you could comment on the typical seasonality that we see uptick in expenses that we typically see in the fourth quarter in conjunction with the golf open which added some expense in and also the exit rates for money market fee waivers in september just to get a sense of sort of where were running into for on that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 sure mike you want to do so the first was on the seasonality in the in the northern trust michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp no just in general on expenses jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp oh in expenses indiscernible mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp fourth quarter expense jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah sure brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so there are components of expenses in fourth quarter that are that we should actually carve out because i think third quarter in some ways is not an ideal run rate for some of them and so maybe wed just walk through it a little bit first of all take benefits for example there you see the trend that took place but the part of it is the fact that medical has gone and its not an enormous line but its had enormous jump from second quarter and so medical in second quarter was something like million it went up to million in third quarter thats closer to a typical run rate but could still see some tweak up from there and so i think thats just something to keep in mind that as our partners exited effectively doing normal things in their own healthcare maintenance thats coming back online and its had a surprisingly large level of volatility from my perspective frankly and then outside services is another one where we believe wed see a similar step up in fourth quarter to what we saw in third quarter theres a lot of business volume related costs within that category that are likely to increase and were still running at relatively low levels of costs when you think about things like consulting legal technical services to dial down and were doing everything we can to tamp those down but that could come back up and then equipment and software on a yeartodate equipment software costs are up thats likely close to where were going to land for the full year the category where the expenses are expected to have higher levels of growth this year is to the fact weve invested in the business weve got higher depreciation and amortization costs weve called that out da is something like twothirds of that line in general and so thats kind of in the soup its hard to tamp that down as aggressively northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 and then ill talk about occupancy mentioned it a little bit theres going to be volatility there were going to make some investments frankly in occupancy to try and get our longerterm run rate down a little bit and so youre going to see that line item bounce around a little bit and so in general id say its less about seasonality of run rate in expenses and its more about two things one is how do we get back to undoing the covidrelated influences on expenses and second what are the investments were going to make to try and decrease our run rate in the long run brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah indiscernible on the money market fee waiver trajectory at the end of jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah thanks so ill do a couple comments there one is as we you can pick it up from the opening comments were right at million only in the third quarter now the reality is theres the billion in money market mutual fund assets we have that is relatively stable at this point but rates are moving around a lot so youve got to assume that rates and volume stay the same but third quarter was million as we sit today the run rate on a quarterly basis is about million as we sit today the team thinks we could have waivers in the fourth quarter million to million and exiting the year so as a launch point into could be million to million and just to give you a sense of what does that mean i think its super important to remember that the fact that if you go back to the beginning of this year when were billion in assets the overall revenue run rate was much lower than what it is right now and so now you go up to billion and the run rate is over million in revenue and so were talking about the fact that we have a decent amount of waivers but from a much higher revenue base and so the story there is kind of mixed in some ways brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats super helpful and then mike maybe on just esg you mentioned at the outset the esg analytic service that you have sort of maybe if you could just talk about where you are in the growth path of that and are you rolling it out to all of your asset servicing clients and hows the takeup and then also on the wealth management side are you seeing more demand from your wealth clients for investing in esg product that you have and sort of the organic growth outlook in the investment management side for your esg products michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp right so brian the reason why i did mentioned it upfront is because esg does run across that company and each of our businesses and you started to highlight it there but let me go back through a little bit first of all just from an investing perspective to your point we are seeing more and more demand from our clients both institutional but to your point on the wealth side including our gfo clients in esg investment product and investment strategies so as a result weve as you would expect with our business model weve looked to fulfill those demands with esg product from our asset management group and as i mentioned over billion at this point but i would say still in the early days of that trend and of the growth opportunity for us there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 and then more broadly in thinking about our institutional clients particularly asset owner clients theyre being held to a higher standard as well as to how theyre investing from an esg perspective and as a result they need the analytics around that so i talked about the capabilities that we rolled out and to your point i would say early days on that because i think this is a very longterm trend brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thats super helpful thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator and next we have vivek juneja from jpmorgan jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi mike hi jason and mark i just want to follow up on the operating error i know youve had those for years and i recognize its one item but large amounts do get a lot of attention you im sure are aware of whats happened to another to a gsib when the amount much larger indiscernible they do have those kinds of errors and i know youve been what do you plan to do to automate more of these processes so that you have less of these errors i heard you talk about trying to do stuff that you need less reconciliation less checking so mike what do you need to do to step up to limit these and hope that something like this doesnt indiscernible larger amount in the future michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure vivek so jason mentioned this is the nature of our businesses and that part of the business is processing transactions for our clients broadly speaking and there are certain aspects of that that have been automated and were automated years ago and thats what you would expect is find the areas that lend themselves to automation you get the benefit of both efficiency but also dramatic reduction in risk from incurring errors and so thats a longerterm path that weve been on and id say the industry as well for some time period and then you have other aspects of what we do that dont lend themselves as much to automation because of the idiosyncratic nature of the particular transactions so in this case corporate actions where certain aspects of corporate actions are very straightforward and so theyve already been automated or portions of them have been automated but other parts where its still difficult because of the lack of homogeneity of the transactions themselves with that said we have this area even though its primarily manual with some level of automation its an area that gets a lot of attention from a procedures and control perspective and frankly as much as there have been northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 errors in the past its been very well controlled so think about it as higher inherent risk as we see it but with procedures and controls that weve been able to manage and mitigate the risk that comes with that thats not to say that we havent been on a path of trying to add in additional workflow tools and automate additional things that we can weve been investing broadly speaking in our securities services area significantly for years to modernize the technology in that area so its on a path and then you have a situation like this that occurs that certainly brings more attention to it but it wasnt attention that we felt as though boy weve ignored this area rather weve controlled it and weve tried to improve it but it requires additional procedures and controls and as we go forward more modernization and automation as well vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc understood thanks a quick one for jason a minor one jason the cis fees you mentioned yearonyear benefit from fx translation could you give us the number ex fx translation jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc growth ex fx translation okay mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp just to clarify this is mark on the custody and fund services line thats where most of the currency impact would be and that impact was about a benefit on a yearoveryear basis vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so that means that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and that line i should also add even though you didnt ask that is the area that we saw the eafe local is down on a yearonyear basis so that was actually a drag for that line markets were because that line as weve talked about before is probably more based on eafe local than i would say what domestic indices are doing vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great yeah i did notice that you mentioned that markets were down and i was wondering which one so im glad you clarify that point and are you highlighting that because the fee rate is higher on that market because i didnt think eafe was over of your revenues jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 no just to try and give you a sense of the importance so you try and predict asset levels trying to just appreciate the influence of eafe local within the cis trust fee base as opposed to wealth thats much more exclusively driven by just domestic indices vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i will clarifying that jason with mark offline thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you operator moving on we have a brennan hawken with ubs jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just actually sort of following up on that line of questioning from vivek when we look at the trends in auca growth in cis versus revenue it looks like at least the way all of us knuckleheads from the outside model you there was some fee rate pressure i know that it doesnt always translate that way to how you run the business and how you strike the deals and the contracts and the way all the pricing works but could you maybe provide some color in helping us understand what might have caused some of those dynamics are those sustainable what was behind that just to help us inform as we sit there and think about our modeling and where to go from here jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah understood i think more and more frankly theres going to be less connectivity between the asset level and revenue levels and a lot of the negotiations that take place were thinking about trying to include a more holistic approach to the relationship which might be what were doing with the firm with investment management what were doing with integrated trading solutions what we might be doing from indiscernible perspective how were handling cash and sweep and so i know its super frustrating to not be able to just use that row on a model to predict the revenue but more and more the reality is just its disconnected in terms of the way the business actually prices these relationships mark spend a lot of time thinking about this too mark add your thoughts mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp right i mean part of it i would also say is fee structure and as weve talked about before to of those assets servicing fees in cis are not directly linked to assets so in a environment where assets are rising that factor alone would probably put the fees at a lower growth rate and then more importantly and it gets a little bit to what jason was saying as mix of business and even within the actual asset servicing fee category a very northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 large domestic us custody mandate large assets maybe not a large fee a fund administration mandate could come with much less assets and the fees are significantly higher so there is a mix thats at play too besides the timing which weve talked about before and the period versus earning over a quarter but hopefully that helps its a tough one to unpack we understand to the point that jason mentioned brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay so just thats all fair and i totally appreciate that but to the point of can you give some color to the point of the third quarter as a jumping off point then like were trends that you saw in the quarter then reasonably sustainable was there some sort of noise that might have caused that divergence to look a little wider just to help us kind of any help you can give on that front as we think about it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah well a couple of thoughts one is that in the spirit of the business does have some compression just to get to your specific point earlier as you asked the question i want to make sure we come back to and address it specifically and those decompressions are going to be honored whether or not were in a covid environment or not i actually think though that doesnt have as much of an influence on the dynamic that youre realizing which is that there seems to be that theres a disconnect between the growth in asset levels and the growth of trust fees and in the short run you can have flows into and out of the business that are going to be reported on the assets youre going to be reported on where they are at the end of the period and the revenue is going to be reported based on where they were a prior period a book period before that maybe average and so its very misleading to try and do the math on shortterm to try and get a sense of what the fee realization rates look like on the business on an incremental basis and even the business thats being added if its being if its a very large pieces of business they could be at extremely low fee rates but if its more a middle market activity it could much higher so the business mix itself will have an influence there but much less on the ultimate profitability brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for your patients with that one my second question is around just trying to get the processing error again and i think mike you might have made some comment about this but i just wanted to kind of explore it i think you said that you all are continuing to review those processes see opportunities for automation control and process review which of course is ongoing but maybe an event or loss like this might sharpen pencils so to speak will this have some kind of impact do you think on investment in the nearterm or some of the expense lines as you guys look to maybe shift ph or investments in automation hire some additional staff for that effort or what have you or is it more operational focus rather than the potential for investment michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so brennan i would say its sum of both so certainly there are the operational aspects which i talked about and just to be clear weve done the full scrub on this incident already and have changed the procedures already and changed the controls already in that area and from a resource perspective it was not a question of insufficient resources in the area that resulted in the error all the same were trying to ensure that that isnt the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 case at any point going forward as well so whatever resources but thats not something that would result in a change in our financials if you will or expense run rate and then on investments to your point there the incident in and of itself doesnt change our investment plan but the broader environment without a doubt youre always we are always impacted by the situation that were in and as a result prioritizing our investments so the opportunities we have to invest far outstretch what we would deploy in a given year and as a result you have to determine okay how do you prioritize those and do you focus on productivity investment for productivity investments for risk management investments for innovation and growth and so thats a process we go through every year and ongoing and i would say in the environment that were in now we have to ensure that yes we have the operational resiliency and levels of automation to ensure that going forward and then second i would say productivity we have to make sure that were investing the technology dollars in a way to get the productivity improvements we think we need in this environment to be able to drive scalable growth brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator and next from seaport global we have jim mitchell jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi jim mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp jim you might be on mute jim james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc can you hear me mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah we can hear you now james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc can you hear me okay sorry about that so maybe just to follow up on deposits it seems like noninterest bearing deposits for you guys grew pretty nicely both on a average and periodend basis where your peers saw northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 declines and it seems like that helped you i guess outperform on nii a little bit so just is there anything unusual in the noninterestbearing side is that something youre trying to grow or is that just the episodic puts and takes jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i mean maybe id put it a little bit in between i mean first of all i actually i think its good for people to realize the reason we did better than we anticipated with nii frankly a little bit less around the size of deposits that certainly played a factor but i come back to the fact that we were able to turn on noncash and loans held in better but then to your specific question about the growth in that category hard for us to comment on what the industry is experiencing but weve back to the theme that we talk about liquidity a lot with our clients and they view they tend to comment to us that they view our balance sheet is very strong we try to position it that way and so were happy to be a liquidity partner for our clients there and i do think that has an influence on where they tend to park their shortterm asset james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats fair and maybe for mike you mentioned upfront that youre trying to do more with current clients any examples that you can give us in terms of what you see as the biggest opportunity set to do more with your current clients michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so first of all id say within the businesses theres definitely the opportunity and one were pursuing to do more particularly i would say with asset managers so just thinking about our approach to the market from a whole office perspective its not just back office or middle office but also what we can do on the front office so i mentioned for example integrated trading solutions or essentially outsourced trading for those institutions thats doing more with those clients so its using really our position of strength which is in the back and the middle office to be able to do more in the front office for them so thats on that side and i could use ill say other examples within the businesses but also i want to add though and highlight its also across the businesses and so its a concerted effort to say if we have lets say an administration client fund administration client are we providing wealth management to the executives of that firm or if we have a corporate client where we are the assets servicer for their pension plans can we provide a wealth management solution or program what we would call firmtofirm for their executive group so its those types of cross business opportunities that historically weve done very well with these but i would say its more because of the culture and the way that we operate and were trying to be more purposeful and disciplined about how we do that james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks for the thoughts northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right well move on to steven chubak with wolfe research jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to start off with a question on just some of the nii comments and specifically i was hoping you can help us think about the incremental capacity that you have currently to remix some of those excess reserves into securities and just as we think about modeling the securities yield ph where are you reinvesting today versus the basis points on the back book jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp the capacity is a trickier one because it depends on how quickly the deposits come in and sometimes we have to let deposits season in order to get proper treatment for those to and get the confidence level theyre going to be able that theyre going to stick around so that we know we can take more duration risk with those and so the reality is the size of the deposit base doesnt necessarily correlate exactly to what we can think about in terms of noncash reinvestment opportunity in terms of the opportunities on where we are investing at the time there is more of a distinction there frankly we did step away from just central bank deposits once we start to feel that the balance sheet was more stable and frankly i think this is something people have missed part of the reason that i think all banks were even going to the point of why did why were share repurchases suspended banks wanted to be there for their clients in case there was significant loan demand and in case there was very significant demand to place deposits indiscernible you want to make sure that regulatory ratios were going to be adequate and given the fact that weve got such a large custody base we wanted to make sure that if those assets started to come toward the balance sheet we were going to feel good about it and so we were patient on that but the more we realized that there was stability from a client perspective the other components of the regulatory environment were there and more stable we could take a step away and what we did in third quarter was really incremental in size and in asset class but if you think about eventually the things we can start to move more toward longer dated securities we can start to move more towards clos more toward mbs now unfortunately in a typical environment you might see more of a 70basispoint differential between the nonhqla portfolio and the hqla portfolio thats compressed and its more like a 30basispoint differential at this point and there are other things that we can do and explore based on what the opportunity set is given the risk and return framework and the different securities that we feel comfortable in but that should at least give you a little bit of a framework on how we think about it and a little bit of the dynamics from a quantitative perspective as well northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc got it okay thats helpful color and then just thinking about the expense outlook looking out to i just wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the expense growth trajectory nii is expected to decline about low doubledigits assuming versus the current run rate things are relatively stable the fee income growth potentially growing midsingle digits at least on an organic basis im just wondering is there room to do better on cost where expense growth actually lags in the organic fee growth to help dampen some of those pressures or how youre thinking about it in terms of the general internal philosophy jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well we still consider ourselves a growth firm and were investing for growth and things even like the growth in the money market mutual funds it takes investment upfront to get the cutoff times right and to get investments done with portals it takes also expense growth on an incremental basis when you think about the administration fees that we pay to run some of the processing side and so i think thats a good example of just thinking we think about things more from an operating leverage perspective and to the extent that we have good operating leverage in the business then were going to feel okay about the expense growth otherwise we have to be extraordinarily disciplined about it and so let me just break it down theres three different levels of how to your question how do we think about it three different levels one is just total operating leverage two trust fee operating leverage and three organic trust fee operating leverage now on the first this total operating leverage thats including a very declining component of revenue which is nii and so its going to be very difficult and i dont think its a very pure test right now given the unpredictability and the disconnect of that line item from the rest of the business so think about that as the one we want you to focus on the other end of the spectrum is organic trust fee leverage unfortunately there thats not a gaap number and so we can give you some components of how we think about it but we cant really ask you to track that and just trust us that its going to what were expecting and so lets focus in the middle on trust fee leverage and there i think thats probably the best from what you can see and from what we think about thats probably the way to focus our discussion and track how were doing but those three elements and certainly trust fee operating leverage are a very big one for us to as we think about the expense trajectory next year its incredibly front of mind for us again we went through the entire re plan we did the replan on expenses we did it on capital we did it on strategy and so as we go into the trust fee leverage is going to be a key item to make sure were doing and exhibiting the discipline we should given the net interest income environment that were in were giving up million if you extrapolate what weve done so far this year and put that kind of on a run rate youre talking with hundreds of millions of dollars that weve given up in nii and were not going to ignore that were going to be we got to be disciplined and have a high sense of urgency about doing what we can to get the expenses as lean as possible given the environment were in james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thanks for that context and just two quick modeling questions if i may northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc one is just how we should be thinking about the jumping off point for other income given there is a lot of noise in the quarter as we just look out in and heading into and then just on the fee waivers just to clarify quickly million was the impact this quarter but it still sounds like your expectation is somewhere in the range of million to million per quarter headwind exiting this year is that right mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yes jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes thats right yeah again this is and i thought about mentioning it earlier but i want to make sure were giving you guys everything we can if you think about hopefully call it billion base of business and say billion of it is somewhere in flow for waivers and the different funds jump into waiver mode at different levels but if you look at where the overnight repo for example is right now and if you look at it nif treasury if you look at the treasury products and those are the biggest products we have and this is youve got to imagine that over of the assets are days or less and so at billion roughly youre talking about million per basis point and so i cringe giving you guys numbers that have such volatility in them but just think about how much of a dynamic that is if that strategy comes down literally a single basis point it influences run rate by almost million a year and so the numbers you quoted are right but i think its important for everybody to track the overnight repo market track 30day treasuries track 6month track 12months to get a better sense intraquarter of what that number might be looking like mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp on the operating income this is mark it certainly has volatility so i can appreciate the difficulty modeling it if you look at averages over the last yearandahalf or so youre probably looking at something in the mid to upper ph range this quarter we did have some benefit from the supplemental compensation plans that sit within that line that were a little bit outsized versus what theyve normally been so youre probably a little high this quarter and if you looked at the average like i said mid to upper james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc perfect thanks for clarifying that appreciate you taking my questions mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp sure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks operator moving on we have mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi so it looks like you have best in class fee growth led by best in class wealth and asset management growth but i still need help on the disconnect between the growth in assets under custody which were up twice the pace ph of peer yearoveryear up and the custody fee line which was up only half as much and then you said timing is part of it but if you look at the last months your assets under custody is up twice as much and your related fees indiscernible so it just seems like outside auc growth relative to the fees and i know you said some auc is not tied to fees thats fine but it still doesnt seem to explain everything thats going on there so either theres something else in there or youre indiscernible based on price or im just missing something thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so let me address the that business vast vast majority of auc in wealth is gfo and the reason for that is thats where the outsized portion of clients that might not manage here but that want to use us as a custodian its kind of a hybrid business between the wealth business and the institutional business and so when you look at the auc number there vast vast majority gfo that client base is very very its very very spiky and so you get very high number of you get a small number of clients that can literally have billions or tens of billions of dollars of assets coming in from an auc perspective and thats not going to influence how we think about the pricing on the overall relationship we think about the relationship very holistically and if a client has a it could be mega mega liquidity events from a small number of clients theyll move that line item that auc number dramatically without influencing fees mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and whats happening with those super high networth customers then what are they doing and what have you seen recently jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so a lot of times theyll have a large sale it could be life event it could be business sale mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp stock jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 single stock exposure that theyre dealing with theyll ask us to custody those assets for a period of time until they decide where to put those funds to work and our goal is to work first of all be that provider so that we can be a best in class custodian for them and then introduce the other advisors managers to do what we can to also be a manager and a financial advisor we might do manager selection for them we might become an ocio provider they might put some of those assets into they might move those assets from where they are into our liquidity funds they might ask us to do tax advantaged equity investing where were very tax conscious they might do a more aggressive esg mandate but the custodying in that business especially if its a mandate of that size is going to obviously significantly change the denominator but in the short run its not going to change the numerator which is the fees were getting off of those assets mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just one followup so the gist behind the question was pricing competition in the servicing business is it getting worse better how do you think about competing i mean sometimes it might make sense to take lower prices because of the scalability jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah in general the conversations have been or hopefully starting to be more about what is your capability set what does resiliency look like how did you handle the crisis what are you able to do to help us from either investment operations outsourcing mike hinted earlier at integrated trading solutions and so all those things in the long run should be helpful in moving away just like the asset management business moving away from just talking about investment performance here moving away from just talking about pricing to more value added in the short run there were concessions that weve agreed to as we do every year and those played through early in the year and so but in the longer run were hoping that these conversation is more about capabilities and about service quality are going to reduce those the frequency and severity of pricing discussions but were always going to have mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc sorry sorry the word concessions kind of stick out in my mind is there a magnitude of the concessions and do they come back or they just how does that work mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp i think it still comes back to the to a year of kind of price compression jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 so i dont the word concession maybe is a little different but repricing thats just the kind of thing that weve seen pretty consistently and i dont know indiscernible talking about that picking up or accelerating michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp and mike i would just add so where you have large relationships that are good but those client relationships have grown meaning the assets have grown just like we talked about when their fees are tied to a bip on those assets that were either custody and administrating whatever it may be they tend to then go up over time and then the client looks at it and says hey you know what id like to take a look at the pricing on this because your fees have gone up because their assets have gone up and yet from a work perspective you may be doing more but not as much as our asset growth and so thats the exercise if youre not able to come to an agreement then a client can say were going to take it out for a rebid and then that process then as a result theyre likely to get more aggressive pricing on it now again we try to minimize when it has to go through that whole process but i think thats the nature for very large institutions like that i would also say on new business just to be clear price is a factor of course and we lose business on pricing at times so its not as though we price to win we price to win at a profitable margin for us and have models to be able to determine what are the resources required and therefore where can we price it and if we cant get there with either where we think it is or you just find out through a process you lost and the reason why you lost is your pricing was not aggressive enough relative to who they ultimately picked mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator and next we have gerard cassidy with rbc michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone i got a big picture question indiscernible your balance sheet and your deposits in fact jason you mentioned that i think earlier questions everyone indiscernible what do you think normal indiscernible the size of your cost base you mentioned indiscernible have much more liquidity today because indiscernible we all know that indiscernible what do you think your normal size should be and do you have any or maybe indiscernible actually get there is it any thought there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp gerard its mike why dont i just first just clarify your question is around as youve started it bigger picture question but with all these factors going on what is your expectation for a normal the normal size ill call it for the balance sheet is that what youre getting at gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes indiscernible michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp okay okay let me make one comment and then since you led in with big picture that allows me to answer it without all the details that jason can provide but i would say as much as you might say boy theres been a lot of monetary policy across the globe and that has elevated the size of your balance sheet and so would you expect that to kind of come out of the system and see your balance sheet go back down so do you have excess deposits right now my perspective on it is were into a very longterm period for this type of monetary policy and so i dont know how to define normal but as far as the liquidity that our clients have right now and what theyre doing with it be it on our balance sheet in the funds i think theres going to be a lot of liquidity in the marketplace for some time period now it ebbs and flows as far as our client and our balance sheet and funds but just in general i think the water level is higher and i think itll remain higher for some time period jason i dont know if you want to add jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp the only thing just to maybe bookend is that if you go back a year ago deposits were kind of mid billion and if you think about indiscernible deposits are today in the oneteens and so i would use those as the bookends but i think mikes comments reflect its probably near the higher end of that bookend gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just to come back to the processing error youve been very good at explaining what happened you mentioned that processing errors occur all the time and indiscernible every year of course was the actual whatever the execution was was it upsized execution related to your normal processing services caused an outsize cost and then second indiscernible michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so gerard again just because your line is cutting in and out a little bit but i think have the question the first one youre trying to get your arms around the size of the loss and the two things i would say one is that it was a large corporate action so sizewise in the marketplace it was a large corporate action and our clients were active in that particular corporate action so that was one aspect of the size it was large for the market it wasnt necessarily any larger for us visàvis anybody else it just happened to be a large corporate action northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 and then second as far as a timing perspective the error just to be clear was identified within minutes of having been made and so its not and then it was ultimately remediated as soon as we could practically do it so we did not carry a risk position ill call it for an extended time period that just got worse because we thought markets were going to change or anything like that it was obviously an unfortunate situation were very disappointed about it but we looked to mitigate the potential costs as soon as practical and we were able to do that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good mike thank you operator and moving on we have rob wildhack with autonomous research jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys mike you started to touch on it a little bit in the last third of the call here in the past youve emphasized scalability indiscernible remarks today you emphasized tech solutions so i was hoping you could give us an update on the progress youve made here on these priorities and where you think are the best opportunities to increase scalability in up your tech solutions going forward michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so i think that rob the expectation would be that i would say its all in our asset servicing business and the processes and operations around that which is certainly from a dollar perspective thats the largest opportunity and its one as you mentioned weve been pursuing that and the point here is well only continue to do it and if you did say within and everything thats happened has that affected the pace i would say it has and some of it is i would say the fortunate circumstances of seeing the model operate differently and seeing new opportunities for scalability within the business model so more remote work is definitely a part of that and frankly managing the processes is different in a remote environment than it is in a facilities inperson based model and so weve had to adapt and as weve acknowledged there have been changes and risks that come with that but also im saying theres also some opportunity where we see to get more scalability but then the other aspect of my response was going to be that in areas where its already relatively scalable so for example in wealth management as that business becomes more digital that becomes even more scalable as well the point being that and again weve seen an acceleration of that in this environment as well because as much as we will always offer the highest level of service for our clients and thats our market positioning thats a differentiator for it the nature of that has changed over time and has only accelerated be more specific clients need to and want to be able to do more things on their own through mobile or other digital devices and thats great so instead of necessarily calling someone here to get something done they can just go to their phone and get it done well that changes the scalability of that activity because they can we can northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 have as much volume of that as you can imagine but it doesnt increase the resources or certainly at the same rate so we see it as i say kind of across the company and its just a matter of continuing to execute gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats great thanks mike michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator moving on well take our final question from brian kleinhanzl with kbw michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp brian brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks guys yeah i just have one quick question at this point when you think about the pipeline and i know its a mix of different clients that are in there and different services that youre onboarding but when you think about the onboarding process underneath this operating leverage as you have to work with today how much longer is the onboarding process as we think about how to lag these revenues in in this current environment versus what it wouldve been previously thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so as jason mentioned we did have a call it deferral in the transitions particularly in the second quarter and then we pick back up transitions pick back up in the third quarter particularly towards the end of the quarter and yet hes also said we have a high level of business that has been won that needs to be transitioned and youve identified one of the aspects of how that has changed the cadence or sequencing of those transitions because some of them are much easier to do in a virtual environment so if you think about ill call it custody type mandates theres a lot of activity thats required but that happens or can happen a lot of it was already i would call it very digital or it could be done virtually whereas if you think about broader ioo investment office outsourcing mandates those are more difficult to do they involve more people and so when those people are remote whether theyre the clients or ours or theres some requirement for us to be hiring people to be able to take on that business that does take longer to implement and to get transition and then theres all types of mandates i would say that are in between there and were moving on them so you heard some of the fund administration wins that weve had in the indiscernible space which has been great but it does take a little bit longer given the nature of that activity that youre taking on operator any other questions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 21oct2020 operator no sir that was the final question that does conclude our qa session so ill turn the floor back to you for any additional or closing remarks sir mark m
