morning everyone im on slide before i hand it over to clark to review our financial results i want to provide my perspective on a quarter that represented significant progress for key as we position ourselves for the future first we received the initial million a little less than onethird of the anticipated minority investment from scotiabank at the end of august we used approximately million of the proceeds to reposition our securities portfolio in retrospect this trade was fortuitouslytimed longdated securities were sold near recent bond market highs in midseptember which enabled us to sell over billion of market value securities out of a total availableforsale portfolio of billion at this point we have fully invested the proceeds at better than anticipated yields in more liquid less capital intensive shorter duration agency mbs we anticipate these actions will add over million to quarterly net interest income in the fourth quarter as for the remainder of the billion scotiabank minority investment we are now through the public comment period and we continue to expect to receive regulatory approval by the first quarter of secondly we saw the longanticipated stepup in our net interest income this quarter up quarteroverquarter this reflected a combination of a more meaningful amount of lowyielding shortterm swaps and treasuries maturing as well as proactive management of our funding costs we also continue to grow our client deposits up yearoveryear and sequentially we achieved this nii growth despite some nearterm impact as a result of the feds 50basispoint rate cut in midseptember we mitigated a portion of the cut through a very proactive and disciplined deposit repricing plan which is a testament to the preparedness of our consumer and commercial deposit teams as a result our beta in the initial fed cut is anticipated to be higher than we had previously modeled and communicated thirdly we continue to see strong momentum across our most important feebased organic growth initiatives investment banking and debt placement fees were very strong at million one of the best third quarters in our history activity was broadbased with volumes particularly robust across loan syndications as well as debt and equity originations pipelines remained at historically elevated levels despite the third quarter pullthrough pipelines are stable compared to june 30th levels and up meaningfully compared to yearend and yearago levels ma backlogs which we have said in the past have a to times multiplier effect were nearrecord levels and up compared to the prior quarter at this point i am confident we will hit the high end of our full year target for investment banking fees of million to million with an opportunity to exceed the high end if our pipelines pull through prior to yearend again assuming markets remain hospitable in commercial payments leveraging our focus on primacy commercial deposits were up yearoveryear and sequentially as a reminder of these balances are tied to an operating account underlying core treasury service activities remain strong growing in the lowdoubledigits we believe we are wellpositioned in this area to benefit as rates continue to decline our thirdparty commercial mortgage servicing business posted a record quarter due to a small portfolio acquisition over the summer additionally active special servicing balances reached a record billion as a reminder this is a countercyclical ph office business that also provides us with unique insights into the commercial real estate market we are currently seeing high rates of transfers into special servicing concentrated in office and to a lesser extent multifamily even as we have also seen resolutions accelerate as we move through the year keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 in wealth assets under management reached an alltime high of billion up from the prior year sales production was a record this quarter and we are on track for a record year while the entire wealth business is performing well we continue to see particularly strong traction in our mass affluent segment this quarter we enrolled an additional households and added million of assets to the platform in only months we have added over households and about billion of new household assets to key as a reminder over million of keys retail households have investable assets of over and only about have an existing investment relationship with us so there remains a significant opportunity to continue to grow in the mass affluent segment lastly with respect to credit we continue to demonstrate a conservative derisked credit profile nonperforming assets and loans as well as provision for credit losses were essentially flat net chargeoffs as expected were up and reflected a few specific ci credits that were known and had been mostly reserved against importantly criticized loans declined by million we also saw a marked improvement in our net credit upgrades to downgrades trends which while still slightly negative moved back to our trailing 13quarter average we believe that npls are peaking and criticized loans will continue to decline from current levels in summary i am proud of the significant progress we made as a company this quarter we announced the strategic minority investment from scotiabank closing on the initial onethird tranche a few weeks later we deployed most of that successfully completing onehalf of our anticipated securities portfolio restructuring at the same time we continue to drive broadbased momentum across the franchise grew our pipelines delivered the first meaningful leg of the uplift in net interest income that weve been communicating over the past year and took proactive actions across the deposit books to prepare ourselves for the rate cuts all while continuing to demonstrate a strong credit risk profile as a result despite the onetime impact of the restructuring we improved our cet1 ratio this quarter by another basis points to with that ill turn it over to clark to provide more details on our financial results clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris and good morning everyone im now on slide in the third quarter we reported earnings per share of negative including impact from the previously disclosed securities portfolio repositioning excluding the repositioning eps was per share as chris mentioned in midseptember we sold roughly billion market value of mostly longdated cmos and cmbs which had a weighted average yield of about and an average duration of almost six years and at this point weve reinvested all of the proceeds mostly in october when we saw term rates rise by to basis points as a result we will see roughly basis points yield pickup on approximately billion of securities starting in the fourth quarter the new securities will also provide liquidity and capital benefits relative to what was previously owned as a reminder we currently contemplate doing a similar magnitude repositioning upon receiving the second tranche of the scotiabank investment assuming we get that approval reported revenue was down approximately sequentially and from the prior year but excluding the securities repositioning revenue was up sequentially and up yearoveryear with growth across both net interest income and fees expenses remained well controlled down compared to the prior year a little better than we previously expected this implies about basis points of positive operating leverage on a yearoveryear basis excluding the securities portfolio repositioning credit costs were essentially flat to the second quarter and included a million release of our allowance for credit losses reflecting primarily three chargeoff credits that had specific reserve allocations held against them as well as lower loan balances our common equity tier ratio increased to and tangible book value increased nearly sequentially keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 moving to the balance sheet on slide average loans declined sequentially to billion and ended the quarter just above billion the decline reflects continued tepid client demand flat utilization rates our disciplined approach as to what were willing to put on the balance sheet and the intentional runoff of lowyielding consumer loans as they pay down and mature additionally we built the business to be able to serve clients with on and offbalance sheet solutions whichever works best for them this quarter we raised billion of capital for our clients and as chris mentioned we had a very strong quarter of investment banking fees at the end of the third quarter we warehoused approximately million of loans for commercial clients that you can see in loans held for sale additionally throughout the quarter we refinanced about million of cre loans off our balance sheet into permanent mortgages through our capital markets group we continue to have active dialogue with clients and prospects and our loan pipelines continue to build on slide average deposits increased sequentially to nearly billion reflecting growth across consumer and commercial deposits client deposits were up about yearoveryear as we managed broker deposits down by roughly billion from yearago levels reported noninterestbearing deposits declined to of total deposits and when adjusted for noninterestbearing deposits in our hybrid accounts this percentage remained flat linkedquarter at both total and interestbearing deposit costs increased by basis points during the quarter basis points of the increase reflected reduction of roughly billion of fhlb funding yielding almost that was replaced with lower cost client deposits our overall interestbearing costs increased just basis point this quarter as chris mentioned weve been proactive across our deposit book in preparation for the fed easing cycle that we all anticipated would begin last month ahead of the cut we shortened cd tenors and took promo rates down and on the commercial side we moved significant amount of deposits into indexed accounts following the cut we took rates down further across both front and backbook in consumer in commercial we effectively passed along the majority of the cut to clients our deposit beta on the first rate cut is expected to be low to mid which would benefit our fourth quarter net interest income moving to net interest income and the margin on slide taxequivalent net interest income was million up or million and the net interest margin increased basis points from the prior quarter our well communicated net interest income opportunity is now providing more benefit as the greater portion of lowyielding shortterm swaps and treasuries mature scotiabank investment and our midseptember securities portfolio reposition added roughly million and about basis points to third quarter nii and nim respectively turning to slide reported noninterest income was negative million and included a million loss related to the securities repositioning as well as a million visarelated charge adjusting for those items noninterest income was up yearoveryear investment banking and debt placement fees increased over from the prior year and from the prior quarter reflecting a strong quarter for syndication debt and equity underwriting fees commercial mortgage servicing had a record quarter reflecting higher active special servicing balances and growth in the overall portfolio at september we serviced about billion of assets on behalf of thirdparty clients including about billion of special servicing billion of which was in active special servicing given the lumpiness in some of these fees and as interest rates come down we would expect fourth quarter commercial mortgage servicing fees to look more like the second quarter trust and investment services fees grew year overyear as assets under management grew to a record level of billion keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 on slide second quarter noninterest expenses were billion up quarteroverquarter and down yearoveryear on a yearoveryear basis higher personnel costs were more than offset by lower fraud losses marketing expenses and a modest reduction in the estimated fdic special assessment charge sequentially the increase was driven by higher incentive compensation from stronger investment banking fees moving to slide credit quality remained solid net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans and 90day delinquencies ticked up a few basis points net chargeoffs were elevated due to three credits two consumer goods companies and one equipment manufacturer that were largely reserved nonperforming loans and assets were essentially stable up and respectively compared to the prior quarter npas as a percentage of loans remain low at basis points criticized loans declined by in the third quarter reflecting lower rates and increased loan modifications with credit enhancements we believe npas are peaking and criticized loans will continue to decline from here assuming no material macro deterioration turning to slide we continue to build our capital position with the cet1 ratio up basis points to as of september 30th our marked cet1 ratio which includes unrealized afs and pension losses improved nearly basis points to our aoci improved by about billion to negative billion at quarter end reflecting lower interest rates and the securities reposition in midseptember we expect aoci to further improve by about onethird by yearend and about by yearend with approximately half of that improvement reflecting a second contemplated securities portfolio repositioning once the full investment from scotiabank closes slide provides our outlook for full year relative to we currently expect net interest income to fall in the middle of the full year guidance range of down to albeit with about basis points of positive impact from the scotiabank investment and the securities portfolio restructuring this past month net interest margin should come in around for the fourth quarter we are tweaking our yearend loan forecast by to down to we are also positively revising our average deposit guidance to up to including expectations for client deposits to grow by to we now expect fees excluding this past quarters securities portfolio restructuring to grow or better this year depending on how the capital markets environment plays out in the fourth quarter given the strong fee momentum and our higher stock price we expect expenses to be up approximately this year this also includes the funding of our charitable foundation as we previously communicated we expect the full year net chargeoff ratio to be closer to the high end of the to 40basispoint range given lower loan balances than we had expected coming into the year for the full year we expect provision for credit losses to come in around million which is unchanged from what we had expected back in january moving to slide the last time we are updating the net interest income opportunity from swaps and shortdated treasuries maturing as we sold the remaining roughly billion of treasuries yielding basis points that were to mature in the fourth quarter at the end of september meaning we now expect the final chunk of benefit from this opportunity to come in the fourth quarter the cumulative annualized opportunity ended up being about million of which has been achieved to date finally on slide weve laid out for you the path of how we intend to get from the million of reported net interest income in the third quarter to the fourth quarter exit rate that we had targeted at the beginning of the year regardless of whether the fed cuts or basis points in the fourth quarter we believe fourth quarter nii will be at least higher yearoveryear which equates to billion or better in the fourth quarter we expect about million of incremental benefit from the september portfolio restructuring and initial tranche investment keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 from scotiabank we expect another million or so of benefit from fixed rate asset repricing including from the accelerated sale of shortterm treasuries i just described we also think we can drive a modest amount of commercial loan growth and some further funding optimization offset by some shortterm impact from the expected fed rate cuts while fewer cuts would be better for fourth quarter nii that is largely a timing impact keep in mind that we would expect to capture more benefit of any rate cut over the ensuing to months and rate cuts would likely provide benefits to other parts of our business such as higher client transaction activity or demand for credit and improvements to capital with that i will now turn the call back to the operator who will provide instructions for the qa portion of our call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you good morning everybody thanks for taking the question christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co clark i think you might have touched on this hey you might have touched on this a bit towards the end of your remarks but there has been so much movement in your balance sheet over the last days not only the new capital and the repositioning but now it looks like the funding profile is starting to look a little different with the improved deposits outlook as well maybe just some thoughts on the updated rate sensitivity of the company as a whole and as you look at things what would be sort of best and worst that you would like just in terms of what happens with the rate path clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey good morning scott thank you so look weve been moving towards rate sensitivity thats obviously often viewed over kind of a 12month period so the as all of us in the industry have talked about the early cuts take a little bit of time to work their way through particularly on the deposit side as we noted we took a little bit more deposit action than we had previously planned beta is kind of low or so which we were very happy with and we think over the course of well be able to get back to more standard beta paths over time i think on the overall rate profile look i think the best version of the world is the one we appear to be headed in if a soft landing is coming which is a steepening curve right now we got some rally in the term rates so nearing again we all think the frontend is coming down so something thats flat to upward sloping i think is the best keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 profile for all of us but on the flip side i think we took some actions as you noted in getting out of higher cost wholesale funding we funded that with deposits at a lower cost we feel really good about that deposit base and the customer profile we feel good about our ability to price that over time and given that the swaps positions are coming off we feel better just about our overall rate sensitivity the other point id make is we had a little bit of concern on the repositioning early just given the amount of cash we thought wed be holding for potentially an extended period of time obviously that cash is pretty asset sensitive so if those rates come down that impacts us and we were able to get all of that into the market in the last few weeks when rate those term rates did rally and we did it at better than expected value so thats obviously going to help our rate sensitivity position going forward and we put that those proceeds in kind of range in a duration thats just under four years so we felt very good about that repositioning and that will again that will aid us going forward r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah perfect all right thank you for that color and then sort of a related one i think last month you all had discussed an nii improvement next year in kind of the 20percentplus range i think that was before you were fully invested because if im recalling the timing correctly that was when you just announced the repositioning so the actual investment is probably a little better than you thought which presumably should be helpful but i guess the thrust of the question is just we still thinking 20percentplus nii improvement next year and maybe just if you can expand a little on sort of the main puts and takes to get there in your mind clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure so im going to start with a couple qualifiers because i feel like thats necessary the first being r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp a constructive macro environment kind of soft landing as folks expect so thats point one point two is were in the middle of planning for next year so well give our full guidance here in january but on the id say roughly half of that we think comes from the incremental impact of the repositioning so assuming and this would be the other qualifier assuming the second leg of this gets approved and we can do the repositioning early in so we can get the full year impact of that we think about half of that lift comes from the complete repositioning at completion so thats part of it the other components would be continued fixed price fixed asset price repricing through the course of the year and thats a combination of some swaps not the ones weve been talking about but some additional swaps still at rates kind of below weve got a consumer book thats running down at rates like and then weve got some other fixed rate securities that are a little bit higher that wont be as valuable as they would have been previously with rates coming down but we do have some continued opportunity there and then the last piece the last two pieces and ill finish with the most important one we do have at this point and again subject to change as we get through our planning process relatively a view on relative stability of loans through but recall that that is a mixing of consumer coming down and being replaced with commercial so we will need some keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 commercial growth not herculean efforts but something our pipelines would tell us that that should be coming but in fairness its been telling us that for a quarter or two so well see how that transpires and then the most important piece is just continued ability to manage betas weve talked a lot about how the commercial book is positioned weve actually improved that throughout the year getting more deposits into indexed we think the use of our hybrid accounts and the treasury core treasury services that are covered by deposits there will be a benefit as well and weve taken some action in the consumer book that would give us confidence that we can get betas to the right level throughout the course of so all those components kind of make up the other half of the and at this point we feel good that thats achievable but we owe you a more detailed explanation when we come back in january r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right good thank you very much clark clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc chris you talk about recent ma backlogs are up quarteroverquarter and whats the change now and why and weve seen this at the big players and also weve heard theres a little debate is the capital markets activity taking away from loan growth or are they im sorry are you seeing some disintermediation from lending to capital markets as it relates to keycorp thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure well thanks for your question i think the fundamental difference is the private equity universe is really starting to transact i think they have a perspective obviously theres an inverse relationship between the hold period and the returns and in addition to that with the tenure which is really what matters sort of settling in somewhere around thats in an environment where i think the private equity world is very comfortable transacting and as a consequence i think youre really starting to see a pickup on the ma side and i think that will continue by the way keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 with respect to the disintermediation theres no question that it is i mean you know mike we raised billion last quarter and we have a pretty good eye on this because were distributing a lot of paper in a lot of places and theres no question in my mind that some of the capital markets activity does in fact disintermediate the banks and i think the private capital private credit markets do as well and of course we distribute paper to all those places clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and the only thing i might add to that mike just a couple specific examples and we touched on this but about billion of loans we put directly into our warehouse theyre on their way to the markets and then another million we refinanced off the balance sheet into the market so thats always been our model and well continue to do what makes the most sense for clients and i think you saw that this quarter in our strong investment banking fees mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just to follow up on the private equity comment you said the private equity universe is starting to transact i got the sense theyre deploying some of the dry powder but not necessarily monetizing the investments but you get different stories depending on who you ask how much of your business is driven by private equity and how do you see the private equity factor playing out because youve never had this much dry powder in a cycle like this thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so i think broadly the private equity universe represents about a third of all the fees that are paid in the investment banking arena our mix wouldnt be much different and your observation is good in that the private equity firms that are putting product out into the market thats a process that takes months or so as opposed to buying businesses that are available which is relatively theres a shorter timeline on that thanks for your questions mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi clark christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey gerard keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris you mentioned in your opening remarks about the special servicing i was curious or piqued my interest you mentioned how there seems to be an accelerated resolution to the inflows that may have come in six months ago or three months ago can you give us any color on how that resolution is going is it big price discounts and then being refinanced or what are your guys seeing on the resolution side to move these properties out christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so its a combination of things gerard if you go to the office market frankly theres just some capitulation because there has to be and things are starting to trade albeit at a significant discount not a lot of new capital coming in frankly to the office market i can speak to that in greater depth in a moment on the other hand with respect to multifamily and weve said before most of the multifamily projects that are in special servicing are concentrated in the southeast most of them frankly are not financed by banks most of them were done relatively recently with some very aggressive assumptions ie trending rates having subdebt in them et cetera in those instances we are able to attract new capital on a restructuring basis so its a little bit different for office visàvis multifamily gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then you guys talked about the outlook for loans or what youre experiencing in loans and were seeing from the h8 data that comes out on fridays that it seems like commercial and industrial loans have hit a bottom and are starting to creep up a bit any sense that you might be seeing that soon as well or is it just some of your where youre physically located and your customers is still going to be flat for or flat to down i should say over the nearterm christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so theres a few things going on and first of all we are without question growing clients so there is no doubt that were out there bringing on new clients we have been obviously a bit frustrated by the lack of takeup of our existing clients in terms of borrowing money and i think whats going on gerard is a few things on the positive side i mentioned to mike there is transactional finance happening so thats a positive on the negative side you just have supply significantly exceeding demand on the demand side here is some of the things that we need to see before we get significant growth from our existing customers one there hasnt been a lot of investment in capex and that has typically a lead time of about months based on all the uncertainties the next thing is utilization and this one is a complex one everyone basically went long on inventory during the pandemic because there was a lot of inflation and there were supply chain issues now people are getting back to really managing their working capital and i assume obviously rising rates has something to do with that as well so i think theres just been a fundamental adjustment there so we do see it coming back we see it coming back first on the transaction side well see it next i think on our clients engaging in capex and i think the last piece that will happen is to really get a kick in utilization because for all the reasons i just described keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 these companies are throwing off a fair amount of cash as they get sort of top line decline and all the other things in the mix does that answer your question gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no it does thank you thats good chris and just one real quick you guys in the past have always had a comment or two on student lending any changes here and with rates coming down a bit on your student lending platform christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so that is an upside for us and as rates continue to come down we basically had a negligible amount of originations in the last quarter in our student loan business we think a decline of to basis points will get that business back to ramping up to state the obvious every quarter every semester there is a bunch of new customers at different levels but clearly with the hiking cycle its going to take a while to work through that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and were still peeling off the moratorium so people are just getting used to paying their student loans again or maybe not yet used to paying their student loans again so theres probably a little bit of transition in just seeing that sticker shock a little bit and then going out and figuring out if theres a better alternative gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore please go ahead q across the business and so those are relatively good underlying drivers to get to the number youre talking about without being christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey john youre on another call or line q no thats helpful thank you and on the expense run rate i think christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operator can you move to the next qa operator okay next well go to the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey everyone this is nathan stein on behalf of matt oconnor so you talked about the rise in ci net charge offs this quarter which were from the three credits that have been previously reserved for christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i wanted to ask what industries were these loans in and we saw the updated chargeoff guidance for full year but are you expecting other similarly sized losses in the coming quarters christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp nathan this is chris so the specifically the three credits two of them were in consumer products one of them was in equipment manufacturing having nothing to do with consumer products so those were the three credits each had their own idiosyncratic issues that i dont think you can get a huge readthrough on broad industries on those nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you and then if i could just ask a question on the nim you flagged a level in just given all the moving pieces i think in september you guys had flagged a nim with a just assuming a steeper yield curve down the road not necessarily next year but could you provide your updated thoughts on the long term nim just given the move in rates over the past few weeks and everything else going on at key thanks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp well nathan i think from a broad perspective what weve said is and theres obviously a bunch of puts and takes in this we said that based on our business model there is no reason by the end of we cant be in a range of to and obviously were looking at different models every single day but we still feel very comfortable with that nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of zach westerlind from ubs please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning this is zach on for erika my question is just around deposit betas we saw a decent uptick in the cost of interestbearing deposits this quarter i just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on how youre thinking about the trajectory for that deposit beta going forward clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah sure so maybe just get to the quarter movement first and then transition to beta so up basis points interestbearing deposit costs in the quarter basis points of that was an intentional move into higher cost deposits but deposits that were lower cost than wholesale funding so we paid off about billion of fhlb advances at a higher rate and i think the more important number versus the basis points on deposit costs is overall funding costs only up basis point so at the end of the day what were managing is the overall funding costs and obviously deposits are a critical part of that as it relates to betas we had expected something in the maybe low to mid on the first cuts we are expecting to be closer to low to mid potentially some of that is we just leaned into different portfolios a little bit more aggressively than we thought we could because we felt comfortable that we understood the dynamics of those the other piece is the 50basispoint cut in september gave us a little bit more room to take action if that had been basis points i think you would have seen a lower beta on that first cut so as we say pretty frequently i think the not only absolute level of rates but how much theyre moving on any one cut tends to impact how much beta you can see as a reaction to that so the basis points on a net basis creates a little bit more drag in but it also gave us the ability to take a little bit more aggressive action on deposit pricing zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc helpful thank you and just as a followup to that on the noninterestbearing deposit front any color that you can share on that in terms of when you think that will reach a bottom there or pivot to growth any thoughts there would be helpful thanks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so maybe just a reminder there too so our reported number shows down a tick around recall that we use pretty actively a hybrid account for our commercial clients that has a fair bit of noninterestbearing deposits in it if you adjust for those which we think is appropriate you get pretty flat at quartertoquarter so i think in aggregate its starting to stabilize we would expect with rate cuts that its going to be stable and if the rate cuts continue we would expect it to potentially start to tick up and some of that is frankly the way those hybrid accounts work so over time were thinking this is at or near the bottom of that percentage zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for taking my questions clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey i apologize if this has already been covered but can you talk about expenses for just given that you have a lot more capital to work with now growth should be accelerating next year you have some investment spend to make plus you have been pretty good with managing expenses over the past few years so just given all of that how should we think about expenses in christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure fair question were obviously going through the planning cycle now but ive mentioned before and this wont change we will be targeting kind of low to midsingledigits for our discipline around expenses wont change in spite of the fact that were going to obviously have a significant amount of capital you do see in the fourth quarter and we gave guidance on this that were investing a little bit in the fourth quarter and thats really just some unique opportunities that we have to kind of advance the business in light of the tailwinds that were picking up from both the rundown of our swaps and treasuries and also the repositioning of the balance sheet that clark walked everyone through clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so the maybe one additional point that i think is embedded in chriss comment but i just want to make it explicitly manan which is we would tell you not to annualize that q4 number going into i dont think thats appropriate as chris mentioned were leaning into higher fee growth so were going to see incentive comp go up a bit stock price is a little bit higher weve got some unique investment opportunities were assessing in the fourth quarter that were interested in taking to get a headstart on but i think the underlying point that chris made is worth repeating which is we dont see the benefit of higher earnings or the investment as a path to losing our expense discipline here manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 perfect and then i appreciate the comments on the nearterm deposit betas but wanted to get your thoughts on just longerterm as you think through the cycle should deposit betas in the way down match deposit betas on the way up or given that loan growth will be stronger this time than it was when deposit when rates were going up will deposit betas likely be a little bit slower through the cycle clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah its a great question with no simple answer because you have a bunch of the moving parts so subject to funding needs on the balance sheet that obviously drives the requirement to have deposit balances which in effect then hit your pricing what i would say maybe more broadly is i think the absolute level of rates matter and the amount of movement in rates matter so if we hit kind of peak at mid i think beta on the way up i think thats worth more than probably you would have expected at the beginning of the cycle but its also a function of rates moving up over basis points off of zero so your relative starting point is zero youre moving up by basis points basis points thats a huge move and youre getting obviously to that level i think on the way down i would expect it to be somewhat parallel but probably not getting to the mid maybe its a number because youre not likely to get back to zero unless some exogenous event occurs so if we hit some terminal rate path thats i think youre going to see beta deployed and beta deployed over time fairly aggressively but i dont think you get to the same levels just because the magnitude of the change is to of the way up and then you have to account for the other element which is loans and required balances for funding manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator operator instructions next well go back to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey can you comment on the increase in npls a little bit more is that like how many credits is that is that a trend is that something that you guys are worried about was that unexpected thanks christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah mike its chris we think thats sort of peaking its theres nothing in particular its kind of broadbased and as we said in our opening comments we dont think its material or reflect i dont think theres any read through from that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so next quarter we shouldnt expect anything like that is what youre saying christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 well i think npls will be pretty flat as we go forward i mean that would be what i would assume for your models clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah if youre talking to ncos mike the three credits then yeah we dont expect that to recur the benefit to the extent there is some there is that those were almost entirely reserved and that was a big portion of the release as well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one last cleanup question so you had already thought that nii would be higher next year and then you sold billion of the securities at near highs so i assume you got a nice yield pickup so better lucky than smarter maybe it was maybe you had some great timing there but so why wouldnt that number so the increase in the nii in versus go higher because of that fortuitous investing of those securities clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so ill take lucky or good either but just to remind you mike the that we shared contemplated the repositioning so what were talking about is marginal improvement on the reinvestment were really happy with where we did it and we took advantage of that pickup in rates but thats relative to maybe its a handful of basis points better not that wasnt had already contemplated the repositioning of that portfolio so again i think on the christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp it still in fact contemplates clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp the second version christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp the second piece clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah correct so it is a marginal benefit which well take but it isnt the entire magnitude of that trade that is added on top of the mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning and sorry about the technical problems earlier i just have a couple christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp not a problem good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning a couple real quick questions on the capital markets revenue side i know you flagged some very solid pipelines and building pipelines there and your expectation to hit the high end of the million to million guide chris i know when youve had this type of confidence in the past you actually called out the likelihood of a record year the following year as well i believe you did that last year can you maybe provide your thoughts on here just given the progression youre seeing maybe how we see that playing out in terms of your capital markets revs as you look at heading into christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah fair question so clearly sort of embedded in our guidance for if you kind of do the math is another stepup in the fourth quarter maybe million or so if you kind of just back into it i feel good about the trajectory i think if we continue to have this kind of an environment where rates are stabilizing and people are able to transact im optimistic about well give more guidance on that john when we gather after the end of the year but i think you should assume that a lot of these pipelines have pretty long tails and so we should go into with a fair amount of momentum john pancari q analyst evercore isi thats helpful thanks chris and just two more quick ones on the loan growth front i believe you mentioned relative stability as you look into given the trends youre seeing given consumer likely declining but commercial increases are you able to give us a better idea of the pace of growth that you think is reasonable and what type of growth more specifically on the commercial side do you think that can help offset consumer pressure clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so well provide a little bit more color there but just maybe broadly think about consumer loans coming down billion to billion in a year just by natural kind of maturity and paydown now that could change based on rate levels and mortgage markets but thats kind of a decent rule of thumb there as it relates to where we would see keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 some pickup in commercial ill make a couple comments and then chris can add on to it but in places where we have demonstrated strength and i think mostly like affordable and renewables which are tend to be project transactions they tend to be construction in nature so they build through time and then we perm them out in some form those i think are places where were starting where weve seen affordable weve been pretty consistent but were seeing pickup there i think the opportunity to build that over time and those loans do take time to materialize just because they are large projects they do build from a draw standpoint before theyre ready to be fully drawn and sold so those are two places where i just continue to feel confident about our abilities and the market but theres some broader based opportunities i think as well christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah the only thing id add clark is as i mentioned earlier i think the transactions business will generate loans because thats picking up sort of a wild card that all of us are watching is whats going to happen with our existing client base in terms of really investing in capex and whats going to happen with utilization and i think thats just a watch point for all of us john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks chris i do have one last one sorry about that on the loan loss reserve you did on a loans to on a reserve ratio basis you did bleed the reserve modestly this quarter can you perhaps provide us a little bit of thoughts around the potential for incremental releases here as you see credit playing out given the economic outlook clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp look we so we view youre right basis points i think down on the acl so pretty stable we built it up quite significantly over the last several quarters i think if you did a loan kind of portfolio by portfolio mix it might dictate that wed be we could even be lower but right now were still looking at were being cautious around migration and where some of the latecycle pieces of this are taking us i think if rates continue to come down and as chris noted the environment remains constructive that may give us some opportunity but right now we feel like stability is probably the right place christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp i mean john theres really three things that drive these one is your view of the macro and you obviously have a perspective on that the next is sort of idiosyncratic and obviously if we were aware of idiosyncratic things we would be as we aggressively took on the three loans that we talked about today wed be moving on those and the third element is the size of the book so those are kind of the three elements and so if you think about each of those three obviously it begs the question of where should the reserve be and well continue to evaluate it john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks chris appreciate it keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter from da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co i wanted to follow up on johns questions on the loans just for the fourth quarter you didnt change the full year guidance for the average which would imply that theres going to be some decent growth in the fourth quarter and i was just wondering if you could talk about maybe just what youre expecting for fourth quarter loan trends clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so i mean we took the ending point down a bit i think that will take us to the overall kind of lower end of the average guide look i think were expecting some stability on the loan side at this point not a huge amount of growth id say some modest growth but whether or not we get that i dont think really impacts our view on nii in the quarter wed obviously like to start seeing some loan growth so at this point id say its more stabilizing than it is really picking up peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay and then chris if i could just ask one big picture question obviously youre getting the second tranche of the investment from scotia the focus would be the securities restructuring along with organic growth but just with now that youve built up your capital levels just can i ask how you think about bank ma going forward christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so the premise of your question is right so think about us raising billion and we basically in the aggregate spend billion on the restructuring then we have an additional billion and on a pro forma basis i think youll see our cet1 at say and youll see our marked cet1 at say so clearly well have dry powder that well be able to if theres dislocation in the market well be able to take advantage of that well probably run with a little higher capital just in the nearterm until theres finalization in the basel iii endgame the liquidity rules the longterm debt but i do believe peter that there will be consolidation in our industry there certainly hasnt been for all the reasons that you are well aware of i think last year there were three significant deals completed my experience with consolidation is when it happens it happens kind of in waves and clearly with this additional capital i think wed be well positioned if and when that were to happen its not something were focused on now however peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks for taking the questions keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thank you for taking the followup clark if possible wanted to just revisit the expense outlook particularly in the fourth quarter it seems to be generating a lot of traffic this morning i know you said higher stock price will impact incentive comp then i think you said some kind of proactive investments as well but at a point i think i might have heard foundation contribution as well are you able to sort of parse if were going to see maybe million of total expense lift in the fourth quarter how much of that is ongoing stuff versus what people might sort of pull out as transitory and then also appreciate that you suggested already not to annualize that but just hoping for a little more deep dive in there if possible clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah its a good question i think the annual the main point which you picked up on which was dont annualize that number i think the fair point is some our business is variable in nature based on performance so hard to quantify that but frankly if we have the revenues that dictate we should be paying compensation on that we would take those like any day of the week so i think you have to think about some of that expense growth in the context of the revenue thats driving it as chris said were potentially leaning into some unique opportunities in the quarter those are going to be by their nature not necessarily recurring and i dont have a specific number for you but clearly its not appropriate to take the full amount of that and i think we just we got to fine tune a little bit of how much expense rolls into the run rate quarter and a lot of thats going to be based on how much revenue we think its supporting so we just need to do a little bit more work to give you a clean look but i do think the again the appropriate guide at this point would be midsingledigits for next year and we owe you as i said more detail when we come back at the end of the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got you okay perfect thank you again operator and at this time there are no further questions id now like to turn the call back to chris gorman for any closing comments christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 again we thank you for
