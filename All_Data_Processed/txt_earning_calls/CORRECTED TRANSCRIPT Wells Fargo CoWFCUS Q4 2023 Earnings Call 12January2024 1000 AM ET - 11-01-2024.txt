and the earnings materials available on our website i will now turn the call over to charlie charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks john ill make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for before we take your questions let me start with some financial highlights although our improved results benefited from the strong economic environment and the higher interest rates our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well we grew net income and diluted earnings per share with higher revenue and lower expenses revenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income as well as higher noninterest income our expenses were down from a year ago benefiting from lower operating losses as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives as expected net chargeoffs increased from historical low levels and our allowance for credit losses increased as well we continue to closely monitor our portfolios taking credittightening actions as appropriate we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders including increasing our common stock dividend from per share to per share in the third quarter and we repurchased billion of common stock average loans increased modestly with growth in the first half of the year offsetting declines later in the year reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credittightening actions average deposits were down driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higheryielding alternatives the financial health of our wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 consumers remains strong while average deposit balances per customer continued to decline from their peak they remained above prepandemic levels as wage growth has more than offset increased spending having said that there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed consumer spending remains strong credit card spend was up for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year with growth rates strong across all categories except fuel which was impacted by lower gas prices debit card spending was up for the year discretionary spend growth slowed from a year ago while nondiscretionary spend was stable our risk and control work remains our top priority and id refer you to the comments i made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and while it is early and we have more to do we are starting to see improved growth and increased market share in parts of the company which we believe will drive higher returns over time let me provide just a few examples our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average weve also been investing in the corporate and investment bank cib revenue grew from a year ago and our investment banking and trading market shares increased the positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite additionally continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns in earnings over the next several years and while our consumer small and business banking commercial banking and wealth and investment management business remains strong opportunities to increase share are significant other accomplishments include we launched a new cobranded credit cards with choice hotels building on the new products weve launched over the last couple of years we continue to enhance our mobile app which is driving mobile adoption momentum adding million mobile active customers in and increasing mobile logins from a year ago consumers interacted over million times last year with fargo our aipowered virtual assistant we exceeded our million commitment to help advance racial equity in home ownership our special purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers for commercial clients we continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base we continued to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors throughout we added new heads and coheads of equity capital markets global mergers and acquisitions financial institutions financial sponsors health care and technology media and telecom weve also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we are making in our trading capabilities including adding talent and improved technology with a focus on supporting our core clients finally were launching a partnership with centerbridge which helps us provide our middle market clients with access to alternative sources of capital another example of how were providing solutions for our clients investing in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in and mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 in we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities as i mentioned we simplified the home lending business which included exiting the correspondent business we are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus in the third quarter we sold private equity investments in certain norwest equity partners and norwest mezzanine partners funds we also continued to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation as we look forward our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the us economy but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle we are closely monitoring credit and while weve seen modest deterioration it remains consistent with our expectations our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority mike will talk more about our expectations for but id like to make a couple of points first we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year and given that we remain modestly assetsensitive the implied fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for nii significant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of federal reserve interest rate actions mike will give you our expectations for net interest income but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions which may be right or may be wrong we hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful second we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses but there are several moving pieces which mike will walk you through we will continue to invest whats necessary for our risk and control work we continue to realize expense efficiencies and at this point we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in future our expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point decisions on how much to invest are dynamic we closely monitor the outcomes of our investments and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see we are focused on our shorterterm results but remain committed to building a wellmanaged fastergrowing and higherreturn company over the medium and longer term i have said and i remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share in returns across all of our businesses we believe the actions we have taken and continue to take provide a path to rotce i want to conclude by thanking our employees for the dedication talent and all they do to move our company forward im excited about wells fargos future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead mike over to you michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone the first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year some of which charlie highlighted so im going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on slide wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 net income for the fourth quarter was billion or per diluted common share our fourth quarter results included billion or per share for the fdic special assessment and billion of severance expense including million or per share for planned actions these expenses were partially offset by million or per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of priorperiod tax matters turning to capital and liquidity on slide our cet1 ratio increased to in fourth quarter percentage points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers this increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgagebacked security spreads during the fourth quarter we repurchased billion in common stock we repurchased a total of billion in common stock in and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in we will continue to consider current market conditions including interest rate movements riskweighted asset levels stress test results as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters turning to credit quality on slide as expected net loan chargeoffs increased up basis points from the third quarter to basis points of average loans driven by commercial real estate office and credit card loans the increase in commercial net loan chargeoffs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable from the third quarter as expected losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak the losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance lower appraisals or the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss weve substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout as criticized and nonperforming assets increased and while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters given market fundamentals and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic our commercial real estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to derisk and reduce exposure and were using this information to evaluate our allowance which i will discuss later consumer net loan chargeoffs continued to increase and were up million from the third quarter to basis points of average loans the increase was driven by the credit card portfolio which performed as expected with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing nonperforming assets increased from the third quarter as growth in commercial nonaccrual loans more than offset declines in consumer the increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a million increase in office nonaccrual loans moving to slide our allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the fourth quarter driven by an increase for credit card and commercial real estate loans partially offset by lower allowance for auto loans the table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate including the breakdown of the office portfolio while the chargeoffs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance we are still early in the cycle and after going through our quarterly review process the coverage ratio in our cib commercial real estate office portfolio remained relatively stable at on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans were down from both the third quarter and the year ago credit card loans continued to grow while most other categories declined ill highlight specific drivers when wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago and basis points from the third quarter reflecting the higher interest rate environment average deposits declined from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in our other depositgathering businesses reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives periodend deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up billion from the third quarter as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in wealth and investment management for the first time in over a year as well as higher commercial deposits which included our efforts to attract clients operational deposits as expected our average deposit costs continued to increase up basis points from the third quarter to basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments the pace of the increase was similar to the third quarter our mix of deposits continue to shift with our percentage of noninterestbearing deposits declining to turning to net interest income on slide fourth quarter net interest income declined million or from a year ago due to lower deposit loan balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates ill provide details on our net interest income expectations later on the call turning to expenses on slide while our fourth quarter noninterest expense included the fdic special assessment and billion of severance expense including million for planned actions expenses declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses while most of the planned actions should result in lower head count some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits but may not always reduce head count total expenses increased from the third quarter driven by the fdic special assessment and higher severance expense personnel expense increased million from the third quarter as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits and incentive compensation expense including certain yearend adjustments as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives including lower head count turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer small and business banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher net interest income reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances we have been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers which includes driving digital adoption simplifying our product portfolio and using technology to automate our operating environment as our customers continue to shift to lower cost channels resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes we have reduced our total number of branches by over or from a year ago at the same time we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multiyear effort to transform and refresh our full branch network ill highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call home lending revenue increased from a year ago lower gain on sale margins and originations as well as lower loan balances were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the fourth quarter of we continued to reduce head count in home lending in the fourth quarter down from a year ago reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 credit card revenue declined from a year ago driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above prepandemic levels new account growth continued to be strong up from a year ago auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression and personal lending revenue is up from a year ago due to higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from a year ago and from the third quarter reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business as well as the decline in the mortgage market as we executed on our strategic objectives weve also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third party loans serviced down from a year ago the size of our auto portfolio has declined for seven consecutive quarters and balances were down at the end of the fourth quarter compared to a year ago origination volume declined yearoveryear reflecting credit tightening actions debit card spend increased from a year ago with both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend up with growth in most categories except for home improvement fuel and travel credit card spending continuing to be strong was up from a year ago all categories grew with doubledigit growth rates in every category except fuel home improvement and department apparel turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher depositrelated fees reflecting lower earnings credit rates assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased yearoveryear due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments average loan balances were up from a year ago driven by growth in assetbased lending and leasing turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher lending revenue higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products and stronger treasury management results as charlie highlighted weve successfully hired experienced bankers which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago reflecting the impact of higher interest rates partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances markets revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products equities credit products and commodities average loans were down from a year ago with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate on slide wealth and investment management revenue declined compared to a year ago reflecting lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives the decline in net interest income from a year ago was partially offset by higher assetbased fees due to increased market valuations as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so fourth quarter results reflected market valuations as of october which were higher from a year ago assetbased fees in the first quarter will reflect valuations as of january which were also higher from a year ago average loans were down from a year ago driven by a decline in securitiesbased lending wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 slide highlights our corporate results revenue declined million from a year ago reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the operating segments this decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments turning to our expectations for starting on slide let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income as we look forward there are a number of factors that could impact our results including the ultimate path of rates the shape of the yield curve quantitative tightening in fiscal deficits consumer behavior and competitive behavior to name just a few all of which we have little to no control over this makes it particularly difficult to estimate an interest income for there is more uncertainty than usual given the markets strong view of rate cut timing in the quantum looking at our results while we had strong growth in full year net interest income in versus our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year driven by the higher deposit pricing and mix changes you can see this impact when you annualize our fourth quarter net interest income which was down approximately from our full year net interest income of billion our current expectation is that full year net interest income to potentially be approximately to lower than our full year this expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions including lower rates in the recent forward rate curve which given our modestly assetsensitive position would be a headwind to net interest income slight decline in average loans for the full year which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year reinvestment of lower yielding securities runoff into higher yielding assets which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits as well as continued mix shift from lower yielding products to higher yielding our other depositgathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable and market funding replaces declining consumer deposits as needed we currently expect that net interest income will trough towards the end of this year as weve done in prior years we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year ultimately the amount of net interest income we earn in will depend on a variety of factors many of which are uncertain including the absolute level of rates the shape of the yield curve deposit balances mix and pricing and loan demand turning to our expense expectations on slide we started our focus on efficiency initiatives three years ago and weve successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately billion of gross expense saves through our efficiency initiatives we have reduced head count every quarter since third quarter of and head count is down since the end of looking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right we reported billion of noninterest expense in which included the billion fdic special assessment excluding this item expenses would have been billion which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of expenses looking at the next bar we expect severance expense to be approximately billion lower driven by the million expense we took in the fourth quarter for planned actions we expect expenses to increase by at least million due to higher revenuerelated expense driven by wealth and investment management revenue related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity in market levels and therefore could be higher or lower wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 than this estimate at this point we expect all other expenses to be flat though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation we expect approximately billion of gross expense reductions in due to the efficiency initiatives we highlighted in the slide some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond similar to prior years the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure while we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives were also continuing to invest and we expect approximately billion of incremental technology and equipment expense reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years as well as new investments planned for we also expect merit increases of approximately million which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries we highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide our expense outlook includes ongoing businessrelated operating losses of approximately billion similar to the level we had in as previously disclosed we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses so putting this all together we expect noninterest expense to be approximately billion its important to note that while weve made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives as charlie highlighted we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company given how critical it is to continue to invest in our business on slide we provide some examples of our areas of focus for let me highlight a few building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority and we will continue to invest in this important work charlie discussed many of the technology investments weve already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year throughout our businesses we are planning to hire more bankers and advisers to grow our wells fargo premier offering to our affluent clients we plan to launch a new traveloriented credit card as part of our autograph suite of products as well as a new small business credit card this year to better serve our commercial clients we plan to continue to hire within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth now let me conclude with slide where we will discuss return on tangible common equity when we first discussed our path to improving returns on the fourth quarter earnings call we had an rotce since then we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns including executing on our efficiency initiatives investing in our businesses to help drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders including increasing our common stock dividend from to per share and repurchasing billion of common stock these actions helped to improve our rotce our reported rotce in the fourth quarter was but as we highlight in the table our rotce was impacted by a number of notable items our returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates which helped to drive strong net interest income growth and as ive already highlighted we expect net interest income to decline this year we still believe we have an achievable path to a sustainable rotce over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 there are several key factors that support our belief our ability to return excess capital we currently have a significant amount of excess capital percentage points above our regulatory minimum buffers for cet1 and as i already highlighted we expect to increase our share repurchases this year i highlighted the progress weve already made to reposition our home lending business including reducing the amount of thirdparty mortgage loan service by from a year ago as we continue to streamline this business we expect the profitability to improve weve grown our credit card business with balances up since the end of and new accounts higher than fourth quarter of however the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition cost and allowance build and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures finally weve made significant investments in the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers and help drive growth we expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like corporate and investment banking and wealth and investment management will help fund additional investments so we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns in summary our results in demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance we grew revenue reduced expenses increased capital returns to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position we will now take your questions question and answer section operator at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question of the day will come from steven chubak of wolfe research sir your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so happy new year mike i was appreciate all the nii detail just given all the different puts and takes that you cited i was hoping you could provide some context as to how youre thinking about the exit rate for nii in per the guidance just given expectations for the street that nii should inflect positively in just want to get a sense as to how youre thinking about where nii could potentially trough or stabilize based on the forward curve michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 yeah no appreciate the question based on what we gave you steve i think we said on the page and in my remarks that we do expect it to start to inflect and trough as we get towards the end of the year exactly when that happens i think well sort of see were not going to get too specific there but we do expect that you would start to see a trough as we get to the end of the year and into steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful and then for my followup just on expenses the core expense guidance shows another net reduction in you noted that youre making investments but those will be offset by efficiency savings and just want to get a sense as to how long you can sustain that indiscernible core expense trajectory continue to fund investments with future efficiencies michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think when we think about the efficiency journey that were on i think charlie and ive been both pretty clear consistently now that theres more to do and is just another year in the journey right and weve got more to do post that to continue to drive efficiency across the place where were going to net out on a yearto year basis in terms of the net spend im not going to try to predict but as you look across the company i think were just continuing to methodically make progress to drive the automation efficiency reduce thirdparty spend reduce our real estate footprint across all of the different dimensions and i think we think weve got more to do and that will continue into and beyond steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks so much for taking my questions operator the next question will come from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open sir john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mike i wanted to ask about the fee income drivers for this year charlie mentioned obviously some examples of progress that youve gotten leverage on investments and then obviously youve got cyclical headwinds and tailwinds so maybe just could you walk through some of the bigger fee income drivers and give your sense of puts and takes and how youre feeling this year going into the fee revenue outlook michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure thanks john when you look at the components there i mean the largest one is going to be our advisory fees in the wealth and investment management business and market levels are higher than they were this time last year and so if that holds or gets better as many people predicting that should be constructive for that fee when you start looking at the other line items like trading the market has got to cooperate were happy with the progress weve been making across the different businesses there but the market is going to have to cooperate as well for that to continue wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 we had a number of impairments across our venture capital portfolio this year at some point that should start to peter out and well see that inflect and then the other fee line should be pretty predictable for the most part as you sort of look forward john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and just to follow up on the net interest income idea of bottoming towards the end of the year theoretically what would be the drivers of that kind of bottoming do you have fixed asset reprice that helps or is it kind of assumed in new asset generation maybe you could just wrap that into some thoughts about what would drive that inflection in the context of any update on rate sensitivity as well thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure maybe ill start with the latter part first and as you can see in the data we gave in the presentation were anchoring it to what was in the forward curve as of day last week which is not that dissimilar to what you have today and i think when you look at sensitivity to that our interest rate sensitivity disclosures in this case are a pretty good estimate for how to think about whether if rates are a little bit higher or a little bit lower than whats in that forward curve and if you look at where we were at the end of the third quarter we were still modestly assetsensitive that will still be the case at the end of the fourth quarter it will come down a little bit from where it was but it will still be assetsensitive and if you look at the forward curve i think on average rates are coming down something like basis points and so it is pretty linear math when you look at the sensitivities that we included in the q when you look at the underlying assumptions as you go into the year weve got loan growth being pretty muted in the beginning part of the year that will hopefully start to pick up as we get later in the year so that will be a driver of it as you get towards the end of the year youll have some stabilization were expecting stabilization of pretty stable deposits across the commercial and the wealth management businesses at some point the consumer deposits will also stabilize and the mix will stabilize as well youve got continued asset repricing that happens in there as well so its a little bit of all of it that brings you to the point at which it starts to trough and inflect but again exactly when thats going to happen were going to well sort of leave well leave to later in the year but we do expect that that will happen as we get closer to the end of year john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research understood thanks operator the next question will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks im sorry if im going to stay on theme but just as that as we start to the beginning of the year and deposit price continues to flow through and the mix continues to change as far as the ddas im wondering if you could just help us understand how do you expect that trajectory ddas i think definitely still outflowing which is wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 expected but in terms of mix and then just how you expect the deposit rate of change or the downside beta to act through the cycle can you help us understand that mike thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure when you look at whats happening just on deposits the trend that weve been seeing now on the mix shift has been pretty consistent for the last two or three quarters at least and so at some point that will moderate more but its been pretty consistent and so thats probably a decent assumption as you sort of go into the first part of the year at least when you start looking at deposit pricing kind of later in the year as rates start to move on the commercial side rates and betas have been competitive now and pretty high for a while and they will be just as ratesensitive on the way back down thats part of the bargain on the commercial side is you get good competitive betas on the way up and you also get them on the way down on the consumer side there has been less movement on standard pricing across many of the products but youve had the introduction of cds and promo rates and all that stuff will start to move down pretty quickly as the expectation for rates do as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so if i think about that then would you imply that like the first quarter starting point we see a little bit more of an nii stepdown and then as you get to that hopeful stabilization in the back half like just because of how that moves michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think based on what we gave you right so we are expecting full year nii to be down to hopefully and if it starts to stabilize as you get to the end of the year then that implies a stepdown in the beginning of the year exactly were not going to give you a number by quarter but you should expect a stepdown as you go in the beginning part of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay i understand okay thanks mike operator the next question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question i was hoping you might be able to spend just another moment on the longerterm cost opportunity i guess im just curious if theres a point where some of the investment spending pressures ease and there might still be an opportunity for costs to decline more visibly on an underlying basis or by contrast is this level of investment spending is that something that will just be sort of pretty consistent year in and year out wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah scott it really is going to depend i will highlight one thing though in the slides that we have there i noted that part of whats driving the investment spend this year is the tech and equipment line moving up and so that wont continue to move up at that pace forever and so that does start to moderate as you go out into the future but as you look at the other investments were making were going to try to be very thoughtful about looking at the opportunities that we have across each of the businesses thinking about short medium longterm results and making sure that were sort of calibrating all that right but i would expect us to continue to make investments in each of the businesses and i think ultimately thats whats going to drive great returns and better performance over time r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then maybe just a question on credit you all have been very proactive in dealing with sort of the office cre situation just curious to hear what your thoughts are on how this cycle that asset class sort of plays out from here does it just remain a long slog or is there perhaps a point where your conservatism has sort of gotten ahead of issues and you might actually be able to relieve a bit of that really healthy doubledigit reserve michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look as we look at the reserve and then ill come back to the broader point there at some point well start using the reserve more fully and then that allowance coverage ratio will come down no doubt i mean thats the way it should work when you think about cecl and the way the accounting should work i think in terms of your broader point its a long movie were still were not were past the opening credits but were still in the beginning of the movie and so its going to take some time for this to play out and as i noted it will be somewhat of an uneven and episodic sort of nature to the chargeoffs and as you work through this because every property has a different timeline in terms of events that it needs to sort of work through so i do think that weve got a while for this to play out through the system r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much operator thank you the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i guess maybe just to thanks for all the details on nii expenses and the rotce i guess if you are to and its not lost upon anyone with regards to the investments you made in the franchise but when you look at the slide fourth quarter rotce three years fast forward its gone from to assuming theres no real perfect world to operate a bank like from a shareholder perspective quickly do you think we can get from to youve given us the moving pieces but im just wondering maybe charlie mike how do you think about is it a twoyear slog is it longer than that love some perspective there wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and i think maybe ill start and charlie can chime in so i think when you look at that page ebrahim i think you really have to look at the impact of the special assessment thats in the results right and so thats percentage points of rotce so think of the underlying operating performance from a returns perspective more closer to that range and so there has been quite a bit of progress since q4 and then as you sort of look forward we highlighted some of the key drivers on the right and in my commentary look weve got a lot of excess capital despite whatever happens with basel iii and so weve got room to continue to return that to shareholders we are in the middle of repositioning the home lending business which will drive not only good better returns in that business but improvement across the franchise weve got the card business which were seeing very good performance in as weve launched our new products over the last couple of years and as that matures will be a meaningful contributor and then weve got to continue to get the benefit of all the other investments that were making and so we feel like weve made a lot of good progress since and then weve got really clear plans to continue to see better performance charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and ill just add a little bit to it and to be a little bit repetitive when you look at that slide again those are reported numbers and so the way we think about it is the earnings power of the company today on an rotce basis you got to make your own assumptions for whats in and out and what normalized net interest income is because weve been clear that weve been overearning but when you add back these expenses like fdic which relate to the past in this quarter and arent going to go forward our rotce is up from where it was so that is significant change on top of that when we look at the actions as mike said that weve taken in the home lending business when we see the trajectory of growth that were seeing in the card business just as those things mature let alone being able to deploy the excess capital we have those are things that are in process we dont have to really do anything more other than let them mature and let them play out that is continued movement towards the rotce and then the last thing id say is just away from those things when we got here these businesses were not on trajectories to grow the card business wasnt growing the corporate investment bank wasnt growing you can go through them one by one and so as weve talked about making investments offsetting some of these efficiencies that weve seen and making determinations on whether or not theyre paying it off those things that were seeing these increases in share were pretty confident that they are going to continue to drive improved results over time and so as i said in my remarks were clearly susceptible to the market environment both for interest rates and the overall economic environment in the shorter term but we feel both really good about the progress that weve made we feel really good about what the path we see going forward is recognizing that theres still a lot more that we have to do ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 got it that was terrific thank you and just one quick followup mike on cre im assuming you had some assets moved through the off the balance sheet im just wondering today relative to a year ago do you have better visibility on where the clearing price is for some of these nonperforming cre or challenged cre loans and are you seeing any pressure spreading beyond cre office to other parts of the portfolio in any meaningful way thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look as time goes by we get better and better information around where things are going to play out but it is still somewhat specific to the asset and so i wouldnt try to generalize yet until we see more transactions and more data points when you look at the broader cre market at least in our portfolio we are not seeing the stress spread to other parts of it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch helpful thank you operator the next question will come from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is a follow up to ebrahims line of questioning on rotce charlie ph mike said obviously you have plenty of excess capital as we think about your outlook for not much loan growth in and obviously theres the asset cap still in place how should we think about what youre looking for as guideposts to potentially accelerate that buyback from the billion level is it as far out as the basal iii ending finalization or would you wait for more clarity in your term on the dfast results in june michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co its mike ill take a shot at that erika when you look at our fullyear numbers i tried to highlight in my comments that we do expect that our repurchases will be higher than what we did in the exact timing and pace im not going to get into and then well look at all of as we do every quarter we look at all of the different risks that could be out there including thinking about where ccar or the stress test will come out and from a basal iii perspective we are in really good shape as we said last quarter were already above where we need to be from if it was fully implemented as is and were hopeful that that wont be the case and were going to generate more capital as we go through the year and so weve got as i said weve got plenty of excess capital we plan to buy back more stock than we did in and well leave the exact timing and pace to future calls erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and mike my followup question is another one on nii i did notice that your shortterm borrowings went up a lot in and just looking at the asset side it seemed like it was funding that increase in liquidity to billion in cash at the fed at period end and im wondering as were thinking about your liability mix in and then i think your average balance sheet size is trillion at the end of the year im just wondering if we wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 should expect the balance sheet to shrink because you may not need all those shortterm borrowings or is there a reason why you feel like you want to hold that much liquidity at the fed at this time michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well its certainly possible the balance sheet will get smaller throughout the year i think thatll just be a function of what we ultimately see on loan growth how much we end up deploying into securities as we go through the year and where it makes sense we will let the balance sheet just ebb and flow back down and i think thats the way were thinking about it now and i think at this point theres not a lot of costs were leaving at the fed given where iorb is and so thatll change as rates start to come down and well calibrate the overall size based on what we think the opportunity is erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open sir john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the nii outlook of down to can you maybe help us think about the expected net interest margin trajectory through the year how we should about that in the context of what youre expecting in terms of earning asset yield and the dynamic on funding cost thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well we dont were not going to try to predict exactly where the nim is going to go quarterbyquarter but i think as you would guess right assuming the balance sheets at a relatively stable size as nii starts to come down the nim will compress right and therell be tailwinds and headwinds related as assets as the securities portfolio reprises thatll be a tailwind as you start to see variable rate loans come down as rates come down thatll be a headwind and so i think most of it should be relatively simple to kind of estimate as you sort of plug the assumptions into your model but theres no sort of magic to it but you would expect nim to continue to come down as the balance sheet stays stable and nii comes down john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks and then separately on commercial real estate could you maybe give us a little more color in terms of where you saw the stress what types of office properties and what type of marks to the underlying assets are you seeing as youre reappraising the properties and does that give you a i guess maybe just talk about the level of confidence you have in the updated office reserve at this level michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 yeah and really the allowance coverage ratio i would pay attention to on the slide is our cib cre office portfolio which is close to and thats really the institutional style office buildings where really the stress is coming through when you look at the chargeoffs it was across a number of properties it wasnt one or two it was pretty geographically disbursed across different cities and across different parts of the country so there wasnt an over concentration anywhere each of the properties have very specific situations and so there was a pretty wide range in terms of where the price cleared or where the appraisal came in a good chunk of these properties are being marked because weve got new appraisals for various reasons a small amount of it was actually realized because the note or the property was sold and so for a good amount of it well see how it ultimately plays out there could be recoveries as we go but it was a pretty as you would expect it was a substantial decline in what people thought the value of the properties was just a year or two ago john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thanks mike operator the next question will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning mike good morning charlie charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mike on the guide for the net interest income on the forward curve if the forward curve is incorrect and were sitting here a year from now and rather than seeing a or fed funds rate if its closer to or how much of a positive would that be for a higher net interest income for you guys im assuming you use different sensitivity analysis to kind of give yourself a sense of where net interest income could go under different rate scenarios michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i would just like i think john mcdonald asked it earlier i would look at our interest rate sensitivity gerard and as i said were still modestly assetsensitive a little bit less at the end of the fourth quarter than the third quarter and i think it is a pretty linear sort of equation there and so i would just look at the basis point move that we have in there its around a couple billion dollars of move when you look at that as of the end of the third quarter again it will come in slightly from that likely at the end of the fourth quarter and just use whatever assumption you want it is a pretty linear within reason its a pretty linear equation gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 okay and then you guys obviously have been very focused on the expense reduction and the admirable job since you guys all got there obviously is there any way that you could bring down the operating losses i think theyve been pretty consistent at billion for a bit is there anything in there that down the road you could change where it would actually fall or is it just something that its just the cost of doing business with fraud theft and etcetera michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well theres certainly some portion of that that its just the cost of doing business now even on the fraud and bau operating losses we as most people i would think are continuing to invest in capabilities to reduce those more and more and thats and we continue to do that as well and then i think as we continue to put more of the issues the historical issues behind us hopefully the overall number continues to trend downward gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate it thank you operator the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi any thoughts on where card chargeoffs go in i think youre about this quarter and i guess youve had really good growth so if we ph lag it like we used to do in the old days maybe wed get about i dont know if thats a good starting point or just any way to frame losses from here thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i wont give you a specific number but the way youre thinking about it is exactly right i think as you look at the portfolio that we have which might be a little different than others is we launched the new product set starting a little over two years ago but youve sort of seen more meaningful new account growth starting about two years ago and so youre in that normal maturation curve and seasoning of sort of losses as they come on and so we would expect that it would continue to trend a little bit higher from where it is matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then were seeing this obviously not just with you guys but kind of across the board in terms of card losses go up even though were still in this really good environment in terms of employment and wealth and still a bit of excess savings just thoughts on like whats driving losses again not just for you but just for everybody there is life events that always happen but it just feels like maybe card losses are getting a little higher than i would have thought with unemployment where it is and again like jobs available and all those dynamics thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah maybe ill start and i think as charlie kind of highlighted in his script the averages all look fine when you look at liquidity or deposit balances and certainly even when you look at the cumulative wage growth that youve seen over the last few years in aggregate you go it paints a pretty good picture wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 but when you go below that and weve tried to highlight this a few times over the last year or so when you go below that there are certainly cohorts of clients or people that are stressed and the further you go down in income levels or the further you go down in wealth levels the cumulative impact of inflation has really taken a toll and so youre going to have some percentage of people that are feeling much more stressed than what the aggregate numbers would imply and in some cases their liquidity is going to be lower than it was precovid in some cases they have been having to build bigger credit card balances and so for us its not a big part of the overall portfolio but youre going to continue to see that which is something we should all have expected and expect to see as you go forward charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and the other thing i would add is that thats something that has always let me say always existed precovid there were always people that were doing better and there were people that were doing worse and i think whats important and ill speak for ourselves when we look at our card losses what we actually are looking at is how theyre performing on a vintage basis versus precovid levels and the curves are right on top of what that is and so when we talk about getting back to normal in terms of what were seeing thats what were actually seeing in card losses were not seeing at this point anything that goes beyond that matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just lastly if i can squeeze in remind me like a targeted customer i think its like prime plus but any way to frame that in terms of whether its fico or wealth metric or homeowner percent or any way just to frame it it is becoming a bigger part of the company obviously so thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah look were not going to get that specific but when you look at like individual products theyre targeted towards different cohorts of clients but what i would say overall we feel really good about the credit quality of the new accounts were putting on and in most cases in most products the credit profile is better than what we have from historical back book matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks for all the color operator the next question will come from dave rochester of compass point research your line is open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys sorry for one more question on the nii guide here but was just curious how much of that decline youre expecting for this year is driven by that continued remix of deposits in the lower noninterest bearing deposits you talked about and where are you assuming that that dda mix settles out this year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah as you would guess like when you lose noninterestbearing deposits or they shift into higheryielding products thats going to have a pretty substantial impact and so that is a big driver of what the decline is for the rest of the year we wont we havent really talked about exactly where it bottoms but it should stabilize at some point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then on capital was curious what more buybacks means for capital ratios and that buffer you talked about by the end of all else equal is the thought that youll take those ratios and that buffer lower this year michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well see but i think i wont try to give you a buyback number lots of things go into figuring that out throughout the year but as we said we expect buybacks to be bigger than last year assuming that nothing significant happens in the macro environment the level that were at is higher than we need to be david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks appreciate it operator and our last question will come from manan gosalia of morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning two quick ones for me i know you said your guide includes stable deposits but a shift towards interestbearing deposits would an end to qt stop that share shift or is it different given youre seeing that share shift from the consumer side michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah what weve said is we expect stable deposits on the wealth and the commercial side we do expect some declines on the consumer side and an end to qt would be a positive manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc and can you expand on that a little bit why would that be michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well qt is draining drains well at some point more meaningfully drain liquidity out of the banking system right so once you get the rrp facility down to a smaller number which is likely to happen then any further qt wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 starts to really remove liquidity more directly out of the banking system and so if that stops thats a positive for deposits manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just on credit how do falling rates impact your outlook for cre losses at the margin do you feel better about working with borrowers and mitigating losses and npls and how long this takes to work out or have things not changed that meaningful yet michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co it hasnt changed that meaningful yet really were dealing with what is a structural change in sort of demand for real estate in some parts of the country so youve got to work through that and then i think on the margin lower rates are helpful but the bigger issue needs to get worked through first manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator and at this time there are no more questions
