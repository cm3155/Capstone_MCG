operating leverage for the full year we generated record second quarter revenue driven by an yearoveryear increase in noninterest income in our consumer business we experienced record growth in new

business generated over billion in loan originations for the quarter mortgage originations reached another alltime high and we expect to exceed last years record level of billion for the full year

of these investments ive already mentioned laurel road and the launch of our national digital bank not only have we accelerated client acquisition but our new clients are doing more with us with approximately half of our new doctors and dentists using multiple products we also continued to build out our analytic capabilities including our recent acquisition of aqn strategies we have doubled the size of our analytics team yeartodate we have increased our senior bankers by in our targeted growth areas this has resulted in a increase in client pitches on a yeartodate basis we also consolidated branches this quarter with an additional planned for next quarter these consolidations will drive future cost savings and support our ongoing investments shifting the credit quality our trends remain positive this quarter nonperforming loans net chargeoffs and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net chargeoffs to average loans were basis points we continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles finally we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders our common equity tier ratio ended the quarter at which is above our targeted range of to our strong capital position enables us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities namely organic growth dividends and share repurchases combining our share repurchases and dividends paid this quarter we have returned capital representing a share for an annualized return of capital of approximately at our current valuation earlier this month our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of the board will also evaluate an increase to our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 overall i was very pleased with the quarter which reflects the hard work and dedication of our team we grew our top line and we made targeted investments to position the company for continued growth as always we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases i will now turn the call over to don who will provide more details on the results of the quarter don donald r kimble chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide five as chris said it was a strong quarters with net income from continuing operations of per common share up from the prior quarter and times from the yearago period the quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses the reserve release was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and expected improvement in the economic environment importantly we generated record second quarter revenue driven by strength in our feebased businesses our reported return on tangible common equity for the quarter was adjusting for the reserve release rotce was within our targeted range of to i will cover the other items on the slide later in my presentation turning to slide total average loans were billion down from the second quarter of last year ci loans were down billion reflecting decreased utilization levels consumer loans were up benefiting from continued growth from laurel road and as chris mentioned record performance from our consumer mortgage business combined we had over billion of originations this quarter between our residential mortgage and laurel road production the investments weve made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly at high quality loans and relationships linked quarter average loan balances were relatively flat as commercial loans declined due to the commercial utilization rates partly offset by growth in ppp loans consumer loans grew again related to the continued strength from our consumer mortgage and laurel road ppp average balances were billion for the quarter up from billion in the first quarter the ppp balances ended the quarter at billion reflecting billion of forgiveness and million of new production continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the second quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and up from the prior quarter the linked quarter and yearago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances which benefited from government stimulus the growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits total interestbearing costs came down another basis points from the first quarter following a basis point decline last quarter we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over of our total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the second quarter of compared to billion a year ago and billion from the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the second quarter compared to from the same period last year and for the prior quarter keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the yearago period the larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows compared to the prior quarter net interest income increased million and the margin declined basis points lower interestbearing deposit costs and higher loan fees from ppp forgiveness were offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels for the quarter ppp loan fees including the impact of forgiveness totaled million up million from the prior quarter the significant build in liquidity continues to be the largest driver of our net interest margin we are maintaining around billion in excess cash cumulatively excess liquidity has negatively impacted our net interest margin by about basis points with basis points of incremental impact for the second quarter moving to slide weve continued to see strong growth in our feebased businesses which have benefited from the investments weve made noninterest income was million for the second quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the first quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest income increased we had a record second quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees which reached million driven by broadbased growth across the platform including strong ma fees commercial mortgage servicing fees increased million cards and payments income also increased million related to broadbased growth across product categories including debit credit and merchant products this growth was offset by lower consumer mortgage fees resulting from lower gains on sale margin and also the impact of msr valuation changes lower operating lease income resulted from leverage lease gains in the year ago period compared to the first quarter noninterest income increased by million the largest driver of the quarterly increase was the record second quarter and the second highest ever quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees service charges on deposit accounts and commercial mortgage servicing income also showed strength versus the prior quarter these were partially offset by lower other income due to positive marketrelated valuation adjustments in the prior period offset by negative adjustments in the current quarter im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to billion last year and billion in the prior quarter our expense levels reflect productionrelated incentives and the investments weve made to drive future growth we have highlighted some of the significant investments on the lower left of this slide we continue to invest in laurel road including the launch of the national digital bank including spend in marketing and technology we also grew senior relationship bankers by yeartodate in our targeted focus areas including renewables team that we added in may weve also continued to invest in our digital capabilities as well as analytics our analytics team has grown by times including our recent acquisition of aqn the increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher productionrelated incentive compensation and an increase in our stock price employee benefit costs also increased million as health carerelated costs were low in the second quarter of last year computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense was relatively stable higher incentive and stock keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 based compensation was offset by seasonally lower employee benefit cost marketing costs were up million primarily related to the launch of the laurel road for doctors im now on slide overall credit quality continues to outperform expectations for the second quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of million this was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of million from the prior quarter additionally criticized loans declined and the over 90day delinquencies improved quarteroverquarter now on to slide keys capital position remains an area of strength we ended the second quarter with a common equity tier ratio of which places us above our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders importantly we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities we repurchased million of common shares during the quarter and our board of directors authorized a second quarter dividend of per common share as chris mentioned combined this return of capital represents a share this quarter an annualized return of of our current valuation earlier this month the board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of the board will also evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of on slide we provide our updated fullyear outlook which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year consistent with our prior guidance we expect to deliver positive operating leverage this year average loans are still expected to be relatively stable reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas the impact of the ppp program and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this year we expect deposits to be up high singledigits reflecting the continued outperformance we have seen todate we will continue to benefit from our lowcost deposit base net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable reflecting a low rate environment as well as the slightly lowerthanexpected loan balances our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact of excess liquidity on our balance sheet noninterest income should be now up in the high singledigit to low doubledigit range reflecting the broadbased growth in most of our core feebased businesses including what is expected to be another record year for our investment banking business given the stronger revenue outlook we now expect noninterest expense to be up low singledigits with the primary driver being higher productionrelated incentives as we identified on our expense slide we are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth namely teammates technology and also rolling out new capabilities such as laurel road it does not change our focus on core expenses and driving further efficiencies including our commitment to generate positive operating leverage for the year keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 moving to credit quality we have reduced our net chargeoff guidance once again which is now expected to be in the 20basispoint to 30basispoint range for the year this reflects the quality of our portfolio our current outlook and performance todate and our guidance for the gaap tax rate has increased to for the full year reflecting the higher expected earnings for this year finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was another strong quarter and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our shareholders with that ill now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions in the qa portion of the call operator question and answer section operator thank you sir operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks guys good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp hey good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey just first question is on sort of ci utilization and the outlook for improving trends in the second half so definitely understand the rationale for it just curious sort of whats giving you that confidence and i guess maybe more specifically are you seeing any pickup in utilization or did you see any throughout the course of the second quarter just maybe any color there would be quite helpful christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure scott so as you think about we always look at revolver utilization in the ci space and so typically for us its been mid for a long time it would have peaked last year at when people were drawing on their lines right and nim has been a steady grind down to where we are now now the good news is that it has stabilized at and as we look at kind of some of the metrics we think weve stabilized at the other part of your question about what gives us comfort that well be able to have ci growth in the back half and youre right were guiding the relatively stable loans throughout our consumer business will be the growth engine but kind of the green shoot so to speak that we see in ci are sort of as keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 follows leasing which we think is a leading indicator our pipelines are up yearoveryear and for us scott as you know thats typically around renewables technology and healthcare which are some of our focus areas other things that i think will help us is our focus on both technology and healthcare and also our subspecialties in renewables and affordable housing and then lastly the only other thing i would add is our ma pipeline is at record levels and that generally pulls through financings as well thats kind of how were thinking about it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats perfect and i definitely appreciate that and then don i was hoping i could ask you about that i guess its on page of the release weve got the securities yields can you go into and i apologize if i missed it in your remarks but just that pretty substantial increase in the securities available for sale yield whats going on there donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp i would say that as far as the actual yield im trying to go back to the page youre referring to i apologize but yeah sorry its more specifically its the yield on securities available for sale versus like in the first quarter well have to get back to you on that scott because i would say that if we look at the total portfolio overall that we would see a yield closer to the range overall i would say that part of the first quarter of might be the impact of the shortterm treasuries and would have had a change there but well follow up with you on that overall because if you look at the net interest income for the first quarter of versus the second quarter its only changed by about million so well clarify that for you so i apologize r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect i just want to make sure there wasnt some accounting change or something that was obviously i was aware of so all right thats perfect donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay awesome thanks a lot don appreciate it donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research your line is open keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc can you remind us what kind of rate environment is necessary to achieve the longterm targets particularly the efficiency and rotce targets that you guys have on the bottom of slide donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp well we would believe that rates will help achieving each of those i would say that just from the return on tangible common equity that we had highlighted that we acknowledge that the reported isnt sustainable at a plus percent range but if you back out the reserve release that gets us to and even if you normalize the current quarter for normalized credit cost of say million to million a quarter were in that range and then if you adjust for our outsized capital position that still brings us back close to that kind of return on tangible common equity level based on the current years performance and so as far as the efficiency ratio we are down to the we also have some unusual activity in there related to certain government support programs but those would normalize wed be towards the range and it would allow us to continue to make progress as we see enhancements in our operating results to drive that down closer to that to range longterm bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you and chris and don can you expand on your laurel road comments how far through their medical school journey is a typical customer before theyre acquired whats the secret sauce that differentiates laurel road from other lenders and at the end of their medical school journey what are the wealth management opportunities just those types of if you could just paint the picture for us christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so the typical point of capture for our customers at laurel road is when they begin their fellowships so think about somebody that is accredited thats a doctor that is wouldnt be unusual for them to have of debt and have a fico score of like and its a great time for us to bring a new customer on to the platform because typically theyre being placed through the matching process and at that point not only do they refinance their debt but thankfully for us they do a lot of other things a lot of times they buy their first house and get a mortgage we also now have the ability to savings payments so we can offer a digitalbased kind of full relationship keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 and what that does for us is not only does it enable us to capture these customers it gets us out of the 15state footprint because we can target these customers throughout the country so far weve targeted the million doctors and dentists well build that out in concentric circles the next buildout will be nurses that number about million is that helpful bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you appreciate you taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure bill donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi i appreciate the color you gave on the commercial loan growth outlook on the consumer side can you maybe elaborate a little bit more maybe unpack the growth expectation as you look at the different portfolios i know youre constructive on the laurel road progress there maybe if you can help us size up the growth expectations on balance sheet and then separately in terms of on the mortgage side im interested in what type of balance sheet retention you expect coming out of your production there thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so let me start with the mortgage and give you kind of a flavor for that our mortgage business which obviously has enjoyed a lot of growth we generate about on the purchase side is actually sold im keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 sorry is purchased is refinanced is on balance sheet and interestingly as it ties into the discussion we were just having about of that is to doctors just as a point so were expecting that business to continue to grow as i said we originated billion last year and we will exceed that this year laurel road continues and as i mentioned in spite of the federal loan holiday they continue to generate good numbers this quarter they generated about million of new loans and we would expect that to continue to grow as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you thats helpful and then in terms of your excess liquidity i know youre sitting at about billion if you could just maybe help us in terms of your thoughts on what options you have there as you look at the bond portfolio which is understandably tougher right now as well as incremental swaps if you could just talk about the potential opportunity to redeploy donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure youre right there were sitting at about billion of cash we also have about billion worth of short dated treasuries in our bond portfolio as well and so we do have plenty of excess liquidity we would typically target say between billion and billion of liquidity from that perspective and so even if we turned around and invest it in todays rate environment it would be a meaningful lift in the second quarter we bought about billion worth of securities that had an average yield of todays market environment would still have in that say range for the same type of securities and so if you look at a billion of excess liquidity and apply that kind of a yield to it it would be a lift of over million probably close to million as far as the added revenues compared to where we would be today and so that is meaningful that being said were still looking for opportunities to when we start to invest weve been more holding water as far as replacing some of the runoff with new purchases but we do expect rates over the next several quarters to start picking up again and giving us some opportunities to buy there on the hedge or swap portfolio that you might have seen in the slide deck that we actually terminated the swaps that were maturing throughout and so the notional value of the swap book has actually declined were not looking to add additional swaps there but well continue to assess that and just assessing the overall asset sensitivity right now we dont have a whole lot of downside risk because if rates even if they do go below zero we have a lot of floors in place in some of our commercial portfolios and so were protected on the downside and so were again looking for more opportunities to start to deploy some of that excess cash john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks don its helpful donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities your line is open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc can you talk about the outlook for the cards and payments business between the core growth and maybe some slowdown in the prepaid activity from the government stimulus and just the impact on the expense from that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so you kind of have to bifurcate the two of them weve seen strong growth kind of across the board in cards and payments the spend both credit and debit is up about peter yearoveryear now as it relates specifically to prepaid and keep in mind our prepaid assumed that our revenues and expenses about equal each other we would expect prepaid to wind down but we would still expect to see growth in cards and payments based on the underlying growth of the other pieces and parts of the business donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp and peter just to provide a little more clarity there as well that the prepaid revenues and expenses were both about million as far as the fee income and the expenses in the current quarter and so we would expect to start seeing that wind down throughout the second half of the year peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks thats helpful and then don if i could just ask maybe if you can give some color maybe about what the margin outlook for the second half of the year donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 well i would say theres a number of factors that are going to impact that one is liquidity levels and thats been the biggest determinant as far as the overall margin and this last quarter we saw that 7basis point of the basispoint decline was related to the impact of higher levels of liquidity but our outlook would not assume that liquidity position build from here and so we shouldnt see that kind of pressure given the overall loan balances and deposit outlook well also see some impact from ppp but as i mentioned earlier on the call that we had about million in fee income coming through from the ppp loan balances for forgiveness and other fee recognition we would expect to see that decline as well and so wed see some modest decline on the nim from the core impact of lower rates and ppp program but should not see the same pressure for liquidity going forward peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning chris good morning don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc don can you talk a little bit about credit quality in the sense that in the net chargeoff number that was about basis points were there any material recoveries that help drive that number down and then second when you show your data on slide its obviously very strong and even stronger than first quarter of when the day one while the day one reserves were obviously established at the beginning at but with the outlook for the economy arguably being stronger today than it was on the day one number whats the likelihood that your reserves today which i think about 160someodd basis points versus what they were in the day one i think at basis points of your reserve levels to loans coming down closer to the day one or maybe even surpassing that number keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp all good question gerard i would say as far as the recoveries we did have recoveries of about million that were unusual and even adjusting for that our net chargeoffs would have been basis points for the quarter so still very low absent that on recovery if you look at the cecl reserves that we have that i think your math is pretty close to where we would see it as well is that while the economic outlook is probably stronger on a relative basis as far as improvements from here i would say that if you look at the underlying nature of the portfolio we still have a little bit higher level of criticized classified loans today than what we did as of january of last year and so it would suggest that we should have a higher level of reserve that being said weve continued to increase our qualitative component to the reserve and so if you look at the qualitative component along with certain model overlays its about of the total reserve so its higher than what we would have expected in a cecl world to deploy and its just given some of the uncertainty as to how things will continue to evolve from here and could allow the opportunity to see some further reserve releases now i dont want to set the expectation that were going to have another million negative provision expense or reserve recapture in the nearterm quarters but we do expect to see that reserve level probably continue to trend down from here to reflect the current status of our loan quality and the economic outlook that were seeing in front of us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then maybe chris you guys talked about the strength that you saw in the quarter in investment banking and you also pointed to that as a result of that the productionrelated incentive expenses were higher and you guided a little higher for the remainder of the year can you frame out for us because weve heard this from a few of your peers about production related incentives as being a good expense whats the relationship for the dollar of revenue that this expense represents for every dollar of this expense that you get an incremental of revenue is there any way of framing that out for us christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yes and first of all its a great question and its one we look at all the time clearly that business does have operating leverage you can think about half about on the dollar falling to the bottom line just as a rule of thumb it obviously depends if they are ma revenues if theyre financing revenues its fairly complex the other thing that is in there gerard that is part of the equation is we continue to invest heavily in new bankers and typically new bankers you have to pay a little bit of money upfront and we always think it takes about months on our very intricate platform to be really really productive so part of what youre seeing is a lag thats part of the hiring that weve done around in the business as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you appreciate it keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is open kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks guys good morning just a followup on the pipeline on the laurel road side now how fast do you expect the new digital bank to be able to ramp up and how quickly could we see that layer into the production levels as you go forward christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure ken well thanks for the question just to give you kind of a starting point right now the nice thing about that business is we already have a fair amount of critical mass weve got about we call them members customers and we have since legal day one weve funded about billion i think what youll see and what were going to do as we go forward is to lay out sort of the path for growth for laurel road but what youll see is well continue to capture a lot of clients and we will see it being a material contributor to key as we go forward kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc and any updates in terms of the types of yields that youre seeing now in that marketplace and does the new business look any different than that in terms of what you can get on those loans donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp i would say that when we look at the new originations were looking for something with a spread compared to the cost of funds that we assigned to of about basis points which is up from when we originally started at about a couple years ago so pricing has held up well and its something that well continue to manage going forward kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and last followup don any update in terms of like the pacing of the indirect portfolio runoff and how quickly you expect that to dissipate thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp yeah weve got a little over billion left of that and i would say that it runs off somewhere close to million to million a quarter would be a general range kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right got it thanks a lot donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is janet lee on for steve first of all i would like to make sure that i understand your nim outlook correctly i understand that there are many pieces and factors that come into play here but are you saying that the net interest margin looking out into the back half of may see some pressure assuming you deploy around billion to billion of cash into securities or assuming liquidity level stays sort of the same at billion and also should we expect loan and securities sales to grind down from here donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp yeah a couple of things one what weve said is that most of the pressure weve seen in nim has been because of liquidity and our outlook for the rest of the year would have liquidity levels in other words the cash position remaining relatively stable from here and so shouldnt see that kind of pressure as far as overall impact from liquidity i would say that the impact of rates and weve shown on the current slide other than liquidity we had about basis points of margin compression this quarter and that was mainly because of lower rates and then another component that will impact us is the ppp forgiveness which had elevated levels here in the second quarter and wed expect to see that come down in the future quarters as far as the impact for both security purchases and also for fixed rate loans that an example would be in the second quarter we had about billion of runoff and it had an average rate on that of and the average purchase yield for the same billion we bought during the quarter was so about basis points of compression on that specific asset class we would also expect to see fixed rate loans which isnt as large for us as it probably is for other peers have somewhere in that to basis points of compression there as well for the rollover of those assets as well janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you thats very helpful on laurel road for doctors you commented about billion of loans from there as it relates to growth can you comment on how much of the million in laurel road originations volumes came from laurel road for doctors and how much deposit growth did it contribute in the second quarter christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i dont have the deposit numbers in front of me i know that half of our new customers which we said were were multiple product customers but you should assume that the million that we originated in the second quarter relates to laurel road for doctors janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 got it and just last followup on commercial mortgage servicing fees can you talk about what led to a fairly significant jump in the second quarter and whether this level is sustainable thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so thats a really interesting business for us janet we are servicing and these are loans that are ph rfas loans were servicing billion worth of loans billion were the primary servicer so think about real estate principal interest taxes insurance the other billion were the named special servicer so when things go into workout were basically the workout agent and as you can imagine at this point in the cycle theres a lot of activity you might find it interesting that the percentage of things that are in active special servicing of that which is an active special servicing is in the retail sector and another is in lodging so its an episodic business its not a business that you can count on kind of a straight line but you can imagine at this point in the cycle particularly in areas like retail that theres going to continue to be a fair amount of activity donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp and just to follow up on that too as far as the linked quarter that truly was activityrelated fees that drove the change and if you look at the year ago for that line item we did have some impairments that came through that category and so the second quarter of was artificially low janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp
