management discussion section operator hello and welcome to citis first quarter earnings review with chief executive officer jane fraser and chief financial officer mark mason todays call will be hosted by jen landis head of citi investor relations we ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the questionandanswer session also as a reminder this conference is being recorded today if you have any objections please disconnect at this time ms landis you may begin jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining us id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our sec filings with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jen and id like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our investor day last month we greatly valued the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years given how much time we spent on our strategy that day today well be focusing on the quarter nonetheless as we committed we will keep you updated on our progress and you can see the latest report card on slide today is also the first time were reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation which will help you track our efforts ive got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since investor day so im going to talk about the macro environment first and then after i talk about the quarter ill discuss how were handling russia and marks also going to go through it in more detail weve been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged and we intend to remain so the russian invasion of ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure back recently from seeing clients in europe and the middle east it is security yet energy food defense cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialog the macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain and while my job is to prepare for all outcomes our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support nearterm growth in the us economy in the face of inflationary pressures citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 but we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in europe hit hardest with central banks responding to inflation were entering a period of higher rates and a flatter us yield curve energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally but we dont believe were at the start of a new long supercycle and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels so with that as a backdrop i think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter earlier today we reported net income of billion eps of and an rotce of these numbers include impacts related to the divestitures so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about basis points of rotce now lets turn to the performance of our five main reporting units well given our emphasis on services im particularly pleased with our performance in treasury and trade solutions fee growth trade loans and cross border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to yearoveryear revenue growth of securities services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up in our markets business our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in fx and commodities this led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of as you might expect investment banking is a different story while our performance on the advisory side was respectable i think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward even if the wallet remains smaller our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise having said that we dont expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry until the geopolitical situation and client sentiments improve in us personal banking we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates we see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth so we like where this business is headed geopolitics dampened performance in global wealth management this quarter while revenues improved in the us our clients in asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our markets franchise as well as you know we are hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as citi alliance which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisors as a result of these efforts we continued to add clients in both the private bank and in citigold turning to capital we returned billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter we now have about fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago at the same time a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through oci and largely caused our common equity tier capital ratio to come in at this quarter i want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment which i spoke about combined with the impacts of our divestitures create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year now whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year we have a path to our yearend target of and mark is going to walk you through these details and let me be clear we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders as you heard at the investor day were focused on our transformation and were making the investments in our infrastructure risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make citi a citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 winning firm i recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run but i firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term so far this year weve announced new agreements to sell a further seven consumer businesses in asia and emea the most recent of which were india and bahrain we are beginning the sales process in mexico and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise as youve heard me say this is not an uncomplicated transaction given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence we will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders and we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the three remaining markets china poland and of course russia we started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to russia in january and we benefited from being on the front foot here weve been managing down our financial exposures both in level and composition and theyre at a reasonable level especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter weve also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond russia and ukraine and our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in russia remains we are in continuous communication with the us government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime but ive run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in ukraine i remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm our people in ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country where they can help ngos deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible and many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees and we will continue to help in any way we can so with all that is going on in the world we remain laserfocused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation i expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of a war which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic and i can speak to the last one personally having just recovered from a brief encounter with covid much as i would like to i cant blame paco for it now id like to turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on yearoveryear comparisons for the first quarter unless i indicate otherwise then spend a little more time on expenses and russia and end with the results of each segment on slide we show financial results for the full firm as jane mentioned earlier in the first quarter we reported net income of billion and an eps of with an rotce of on billion of revenues embedded in these results are asia consumer divestiturerelated impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation in the quarter total revenues decreased as strength in net interest income driven by services and pbwm was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue across businesses that said we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on investor day which i will walk you through in detail shortly citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 total expenses of billion increased or excluding the asia divestiturerelated impacts i just mentioned cost of credit was million as net credit losses of million were partially offset by a net acl release embedded in the net acl release is a russiarelated build of approximately billion this includes billion related to exposure to russia and about million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment this was more than offset by a release related to a covid19 uncertainty reserve primarily in us personal banking given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio specifically in the us as of today we have about billion in total reserves with a reservetofunded loan ratio of on slide we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers as i mentioned earlier we incurred some divestiturerelated costs this quarter these costs largely related to a goodwill writedown that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures it is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral excluding the divestiturerelated costs expenses increased by approximately of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about twothirds related to the risk controls data and finance programs and approximately of that is related to technology investments about of the increase was driven by businessled investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisors in addition we are investing in technology across services wealth and cards was due to higher revenue and volumerelated expenses largely in markets and cards and approximately was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments partially offset by productivity savings across all of these buckets we continue to invest in technology which is up for the quarter on slide we provide an update on our exposure to russia as jane mentioned as of the end of the quarter our remaining exposure to russia stood at about billion down from billion at year end and importantly the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way we have reduced our direct russia country risk exposure from billion to about billion which consists of loans afs derivatives and off balance sheet exposure the remaining exposure which previously totaled billion now totals billion and consists of deposits and cash with the central bank reverse repos and crossborder exposure additionally our net investment in our russian entity is now approximately million down from about billion at year end and the currency translation adjustment or cta related to our net investment stands at billion and as i mentioned previously we took credit reserves of about billion with about billion for direct exposures to russia and another approximately million for broader impacts given the macro environment so we feel we have reserved prudently at this point in the normal course of our planning and risk management we run a range of stress scenarios and weve taken this same approach with our exposure to russia and as a result of the actions that weve taken to reduce our risk we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately billion to billion down meaningfully from what i described at our investor day on slide we show net interest income loans and deposits in the first quarter net interest income increased by approximately million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count excluding day count net interest income increased by approximately million sequentially net interest margin increased by basis points as lower average deposits in services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in markets citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 on a yearoveryear basis net interest income increased by approximately million driven by cards deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio partially offset by lower net interest income in markets and we grew average loans by approximately in both icg and pbwm on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics we maintained a very strong balance sheet of our trillion balance sheet about or billion are highquality liquid assets or hqla and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately billion from a capital perspective we ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio of approximately under both standardized and advanced approaches with standardized remaining the binding ratio down from at year end during the quarter we adopted saccr and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates we will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter however it is important to note that despite these impacts we continued to expect to manage to a cet1 ratio of by the end of the year due to the expected gsib surcharge increase to at the beginning of we expect the combination of net income generation dta utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in asia to be sufficient to reach the cet1 ratio by the end of the year as we said at investor day were committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders and as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio reversing that billion interest ratedriven impact we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time and as you know under the scb framework and given the uncertain macro environment we assess on a quarterbyquarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year for the second quarter we expect only a modest amount of buybacks and well evaluate that level throughout the quarter taking into account market conditions on slide we show a sequential cet1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter as i just mentioned our cet1 capital ratio ended the year at as we built capital to absorb the impact of sa ccr on our rwa post saccr adoption our ratio stood at as of january given the sizeable impact of some of the drivers i wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of about first we generated net income which added basis points second over billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about basis points third the interest rate impact on aoci through our investment portfolio drove a basis point reduction fourth the increase in disallowed dta largely driven by the reduction in cet1 due to the interest rate impact i just mentioned drove another 15basispoint reduction finally the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors including a reduction in rwa with all of that said as i just mentioned we have a path to a cet1 capital ratio by year end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders on slide we show the results for our institutional clients group revenues decreased largely driven by investment banking partially offset by an increase in services revenue and markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year expenses increased driven by transformation investments businessled investments and volumerelated expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was nearly billion largely driven by a billion build related to our exposures in russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment and outside of russia we continued to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients balance sheets remain healthy this resulted in net income of billion down approximately largely driven by the higher expenses and an acl build versus a release in the prior year we grew average citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 loans by largely driven by trade finance average deposits grew as we continued to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions and icg delivered an rotce of on slide we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at investor day which we will continue to show you each quarter in services we continued to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients and we expect that momentum to continue in treasury and trade solutions revenues were up driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients and we continue to see strong underlying drivers in tts that indicate continued strong client activity with us dollar clearing volumes up crossborder flows up and commercial card volumes up again these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately of total tts fee revenue securities services revenues grew as net interest income grew driven by higher interest rates across currencies and fee revenues grew due to higher assets under custody overall markets revenues were down versus a strong quarter last year in the quarter activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty fixed income markets revenues were down we saw strong client engagement particularly with our corporate clients in fx and commodities with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity equity markets revenues were down compared to a very strong prioryear period in the quarter we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances banking revenues excluding gains or losses on loan hedges were down as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets investment banking revenues were down driven by the contraction in capital markets activity partially offset by growth in ma corporate lending revenues were down largely driven by lower average loans now turning to slide we show the results for our personal banking and wealth management business revenues declined as net interest income was more than offset by lower noninterest revenue expenses were up driven by transformation investments businessled investments and higher volumedriven expenses partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was a million benefit as an acl release more than offset net credit losses we had a net release of over billion of acl related to covid19 uncertainty reserves i would note that even after this release we maintain over billion in credit reserves against our us cards portfolios or approximately of total loans this resulted in a net income decline of and an rotce of just over adjusting for the acl release rotce would have been approximately on slide we show pbwm revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics branded cards revenues declined on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continued to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement we are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up card spend volumes also up and average loans up retail services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance and we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up and average loans up citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 while payment rates remain elevated we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization as a result interestearning balances in branded cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis while retail services grew interestearning balances by sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes retail banking revenues declined largely driven by lower mortgage originations wealth revenues declined driven by less client activity in investments partially offset by higher deposits investment revenues declined as geopolitical tension impacted the capital markets which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity particularly in asia however underlying drivers remained strong with average deposits up average loans up client assets up and client advisors up on slide we show results for the legacy franchises revenues declined driven by lower revenue across the exit markets largely driven by the korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in asia expenses were up largely driven by the goodwill impairment i mentioned earlier but again this is neutral to capital cost of credit was million in the quarter driven by net credit losses and as a result net income declined significantly on slide we show results for corporate other revenues increased significantly largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio expenses were down largely on lower compensation expenses and to briefly touch on the full year outlook at this point we still expect to see lowsingle digit revenue growth and midsingle digit expense growth both excluding divestiturerelated impacts this year and with that jane and i would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi there how are you okay so when i first looked at the reserve release even including the million sic billion russian reserve we were like wait what economic scenario are they writing to because everybody else added provisions but now that youve given us some of the color i start to understand it so it feels to me and correct me if im wrong you just were slower to release the covid reserves and it sounds like you still have a lot in the coffers with that that you mentioned so i just want to see if you can give a little more color between what you took reserves for what you released reserves for and if you tweaked your economic scenarios at all to get to the current reserve if thats not too much to ask jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there glenn why dont i kick off and ill pass it to mark so you are absolutely right we had taken a rather conservative approach to releasing our covidrelated reserves in the us personal banking business last year compared to some we were comfortable that this quarter that was the appropriate thing to do given the state of covid and the us economy and as you can see from the numbers with a acl coverage ratio and with citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 the ratio that we have in cards in particular im very comfortable that we have a prudent and appropriate reserve level but let me hand it over to mark for the down and the dirty mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah good morning glenn i think youve captured it right in the sense we obviously did a meaningful build related to russia the majority of the release was in fact tied to the covid19 management adjustment that jane referenced as we thought about these scenarios as you know we run a base scenario we did tweak that a bit in bringing the gdp assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption and the other piece is when we look the downside scenario so our analysis for cecl is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario under the downside scenario we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that were all managing through so those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that weve reported which is a net release but largely driven by those two drivers jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and id just add in as mark talked about in his prepared remarks we took an additional reserve of million for the second and third order impacts of the war and the impacts on supply chains and other pieces that as we look forward we were concerned about for the global economy its a huge source of uncertainty as to what that will be mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thats part of the billion obviously i would point out that when you look through at the underlying performance of the portfolio theyre still holding up quite nicely when you look at the performance of our consumer customers whether youre looking at the ncl rate and where thats trending or you look at the 90day delinquency and where thats trending still very strong even when you look on the corporate side if you adjust for the russiarelated build and those drove a bit of the nal increase but still very strong performance there too operator your next question comes from erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask you a question jane and mark on cet1 and wanted to make sure we get your investors get the message correctly so from the you said that net income capital release from divestitures and dta utilization are going to be the drivers to build to cet1 by year end obviously aoci is a wild card citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 unpredictable but perhaps give us a sense of should we then think about the buyback as just a fallout in terms of that equation right is the first question number two what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year and third how does the dta impact that was negative in the first quarter turn to a positive impact and mark nice job on the rwa i think that everybody was scared that that was going to be a big negative number this quarter mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you you got a lot there erika that weve got to unpack so ill try to capture it all and youll point to whatever i may miss but lets start with the beginning of your question just kind of the and how we build back up to the so we ended the quarter at an estimated to get to the thatd be somewhere between billion and billion of capital that would be required jane mentioned i mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that you pointed out a few of them so you will have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter so you can forecast what that would be there is probably another billion or so of a benefit from the dta so what i mean by that theres the million that ive referenced in the past of utilization of the dta and the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter so there are two components that carry forwards that impact the dta and then there is the timing difference which is equated to about of our capital so this quarter we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed dta in part because of how the oci reduction played through so as that bleeds back in over time we would expect to have capital build up which increases that threshold and therefore be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the dta the third component would be the capital from exits so you didnt mention that one as you know there are a number of exits that were looking to close by the end of the year theyll contribute about billion of capital to that equation and then there is the bleeding back in of the oci impact which will give or take give us another billion so those are the pluses those are the things that kind of play in on the capitalgeneration side and then on the offsets youve got preferred dividends you got common dividends whatever growth we play out or put to work from an rwa point of view and that leaves the balance for share repurchases as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we would expect in the second quarter a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes the good news is that the headwinds that weve talked about all things being equal so assuming no further rate changes many of those headwinds bleed back in over time allowing for us to do what weve committed to which is returning capital to shareholders over time in terms of dividends we always look at that as part of the ccar submission and part of our broader capital planning but well see how the results come out from ccar but i would lean in on a point weve had to make a number of times now which is given where were trading it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks and so well likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend but stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve operator and your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi could you talk some about treasury and trade solutions both at the first quarter level i guess securities services did better what youre seeing just combination of rates and more corporate demand and the complexity around the global situation and then just more generally the joint calling efforts you guys are doing with lending and payments so from the specific to the general jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well maybe i kick off with a couple of pieces and then hand it over to mark i think what weve seen frankly mike across the board this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about be it in markets we had a lot of strong corporate activities and fx that we saw tremendous activity for tts growing with our commercial banking clients and we saw a lot of linkages across and obviously it was a strong quarter for us in trade because again with the global network the ability to provide clients with endtoend solutions in this interesting world that were living in is something they really rely upon us so you saw trade loans up you saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you in investor day performing particularly strongly but mark why dont i pass to you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah id make a couple comments so one id point out that again we had a strong quarter in tts the revenues were up versus the prior quarter up that was yearoveryear versus the prior quarter up and yes some of that was due to rates playing through so net interest income was up but look at the non interest revenue that was up so to your point jane were seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well securities services had a good quarter as well it was up revenue yearoveryear and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well so as you said good strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty thats out here particularly as it relates to supply chains helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that were seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well so i would say a very good quarter very strong quarter for tts and we expect that momentum to continue jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and to your question about sort of joint calling effort were quite for it making sure that were forensically managing the synergies that we talked about crosscalling efforts and i think paco and i are both pleased with how those are going and this quarter was an example of that operator and your next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i was hoping to follow up on the russian slide here a bit on the russian slide i guess first question why dont you take just a bigger kind of stab at reserving for maybe the severe stress scenario im not really an expert on whats going on but from what i read it it feels kind of pretty severe and it seems like broadly citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 speaking kind of other corporations not as many banks but just corporations are taking kind of more material losses versus billion on billion and then just a related question if you could elaborate on what the broader impacts is i guess im a little surprised that the reserve for that was as big as the direct russian reserve or roughly the same mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure why dont i take that so the first thing id say is that were not a billion right so we ended the year last year at billion we ended the quarter at billion of exposure so we brought the exposure down by billion inside of the last three months id also point out that a number of things were important components of that so if you look at slide youll see that the loans and these are both icg and consumer loans largely icg largely corporate loans have come down by million and thats really been a reduction in our risk exposure right so borrowers paying down us limiting the extension of new credit et cetera the afs securities have come down million and that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales so weve gotten out of those securities yes there are some markettomarket losses but theyre not material that flows through oci not material you can see that the offbalance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because weve actually seen the repayment of those loans come back and weve been weve had to put that cash with the central bank just given some of the restrictions that are there weve been actively working down the reverse repo assets which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure and weve been bringing down the thirdparty crossborder exposure so a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to billion and if you think about the billion that i referenced its kind of net of billion right so the second part of your question was how do we think about reserves and what are those different components well we look at the reserves in terms of the actual namespecific loan exposure we have how were rating those entities in this environment and then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating so that billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these russian clients and entities the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you and then theres a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this so we built the reserves considering those multiple components the last point id make is that when you look at some of the names there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country and they provide parental support for some of the exposure thats here as well so we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well operator and our next question thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jane hi mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hey good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark you did a good job in describing the cet1 ratio walk for us whats new that none of us have experienced yet on an ongoing basis is the saccr the basis points that reduced your cet1 ratio can you share with us how does that work on an ongoing basis is that a number thats going to stay constant or does that change every quarter based upon increase or lower risk in this area mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah its an increase in our riskweighted assets thats really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have what id say is obviously how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that but importantly its a market dynamic that needs to play out as well so as more rwa and capital is required for these types of positions there has to its going to impact returns and ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement and so it will continue to evolve the thing id point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular markets you would have heard us mention at investor day that were looking continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet optimize rwa right and so we talked about targeting our revenue to rwa for our markets business and were actively working at that now and thats going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns operator your next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning jane mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just sticking with capital a twopart question one if rates continue to move higher mark is there anything you can do to hedge the aoci and secondly if you can walk us through around banamex if you do strike a deal at some point this year what are the implication on capital at deal announcement versus deal close would appreciate that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so look i mean there what weve built in what weve got built into the forecast and the walk back to is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter so thats what weve built in as we think about that that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter basis points on the twoyear in the quarter thats now in the expectation we have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as i think about the outlook and as i think about the walk we do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to oci and well continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases which by the way weve been actively doing over the past couple years if you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved weve been moving from out of afs and into held to maturity over the past couple years reducing that risk of a negative impact to oci and if you look at the dv01 weve cut that down from as high as million to about million or so so weve been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity if you will why dont i let jane kind of touch on the mexico piece jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah so as i said its quite a complex separation and transaction as were going to be separating our market leading and sizeable icg franchise in mexico from the consumer and the small business business that well be selling it will take a bit of time as we work through this its a fantastic franchise and as we are starting some very preliminary conversations with the buyers its attracting a lot of attention because it is a onceinalifetime opportunity here and we have a range of options im sure ahead from ipo sale et cetera but this is going to take time we want to do it properly and by time i mean a few quarters so i think were not anticipating at this very early stage whether that would be this year or early next year but mark why dont i pass to you in terms of how we look at the cta impact of that one mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so look i mean as you said jane the whats going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people for the business and equally important for our shareholders and were going to absolutely make sure we do that in terms of the way this plays out as i think youre aware and ive mentioned before that weve got roughly a billion billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer mexico franchise and so when we citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 sign the deal we will have that flow through the pl it ultimately gets offset at closing and so again youd have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact but thats kind of the component that would play through at signing whenever that were to occur operator and your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc couple of questions one a little bit tickytacky but on your nim sensitivity that you gave in your 10q 10k it would be helpful to understand how much of that nim sensitivity is coming from the nonlegacy businesses how much that have nim sensitivity is going to be retained after you sell out the businesses that youve identified mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i dont have that breakout betsy i mean i well have to kind of get back to you on that i dont have that breakout operator and your next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi mark jane a quick question probably more for mark the rwa increase from the higher volatility that youd have seen in your trading assets in the first quarter what was the offset to that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so look in the first quarter the major driver that weve seen is really on the credit risk side from an rwa point of view and that was really tied to saccr thats the biggest driver of the fourth quarter the first quarter rwa increase that weve seen so the rwa from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations that was kind of those are kind of the main drivers there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and what id say is and you certainly heard this loud and clear from paco at investor day a lot of the strategy here is also making sure that were optimizing our capital were very mindful around the returns that were generating and how we allocate and deploy capital and this was a quarter that andy and paco in running the businesses are being very mindful around that so that also helped citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so like i said securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equities derivatives operator operator instructions our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi so it was encouraging certainly to hear you guys reaffirm the guidance for a lowsingle digit revenue growth midsingle digit expense growth but just given the positive surprise on revenues in the quarter the number of rate hikes getting baked into the forward curve has increased since your last update want to get some perspective on just why you didnt revise the revenue forecast higher and just given the pace and timing of investments as we look ahead to and beyond how should we think about the timing for when you guys can get back to positive operating leverage mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look let me kind of take that so on the revenue side as you would have heard us describe there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty thats out there and so while there have been increases as it relates to rates and weve seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets and so as i mentioned there are offsets that play out and so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line in terms of the expenses as i mentioned at investor day the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important and were still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to businessled investments on the businessled investment side the good news is that were starting to see some of the top line strength play out not just driven by rates but also driven by things like fees which is what weve forecasted on the transformation side we continue to make progress and weve talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 we expect that that will peak or arc if you will as we talked about at investor day and that will occur in the near term and will be an important offset if you will to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from that spending plays through jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and just to chip in as well were committed to the arc of the investments on our transformation and on our growth we think theyre both critically important were equally committed to managing our expense base prudently and forensically and i think the piece if there is any comfort from our numbers is were getting on with it were not hanging around here youve seen us do that with the divestitures were doing the same on our transformation and on our investment side getting very focused on making sure we deliver the results youd expect from them youll see something similar when we start divesting and closing the different transactions and well talk to you about what were doing on getting those any stranded expenses out and getting focused on that so you can expect us to see us going pretty aggressively after different elements of our cost base as the timing is appropriate operator and your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken please check your mute button all right if i may move along to the next next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning mark and jane mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities maybe just a question on just following up on the last question do you have a specific update for nii growth this year given the forward curve is substantially higher than basis points and how youre thinking about nii overall and then as a subset of that how do we think about your deposit base your more institutional deposit base acting in aggressive qt environment thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure look im not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out if you will for the revenues were standing by the full year guidance that weve talked about obviously with rates moving the way that they have we would expect that we would see some improvement on the nii line but i havent given specific guidance broken out for the two lines in terms of the deposit base we have as you know weve got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits we skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base that generally comes with a higher beta citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 and so theyre likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates and quantitative tightening will certainly have a longerterm impact on the level of deposits thats out there but with that said our plans both in the near term and as weve played out the investor day forecast dont hinge upon significant growth in deposits wed expect some growth but growth consistent with kind of prepandemic levels but thats not outsized growth and we believe our strategy which is broader than just going after deposits but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves operator and your next question comes from erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi actually chubak and jim asked my question i think it might be helpful to consider mark for next quarter to break out the nii guide given obviously the uncertainty that we all have on forecasting trading and investment banking thanks so much mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks erika operator your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just wanted to ask about how youre thinking about the us card business this is an area where it feels like in some areas youve been lagging a bit and in other areas accelerating and i just wanted to get a sense as to how youre thinking about the trajectory this year in particular since its one of the better margin businesses that youve got and it also obviously keys into the reserve ratio a bit thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah im surprised you thought we were lagging because we certainly dont see that ive been really pleased with how the cards franchise has been performing on multiple different drivers on client acquisition on the spend on some of the new propositions that weve been bringing in you heard from anand about the growth on proprietary cards the installment lending growth up albeit from a small base this quarter so there are multiple different dimensions so i think its were very pleased to see the business actually picking up and as i said betsy in my prepared remarks i like where the business is headed i think part of it is i am more positive around the us economy and the us consumer than really any other geographies around the world and that helps with so much momentum in the labor market were seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheets i think we have peaked in the payment rates so were just starting to see the first signs of that coming down and i think thats good because its a return to a more it should be the return this year to more healthy behavior citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 the spend has obviously been quite remarkable its up in the mid20 also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again and that weve been seeing it in travel weve been seeing it in apparel people like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant those different things its nice to see things coming back to normality mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so im pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed the recovery from covid where its headed and im also pretty happy with the strategy that anand laid out and the progress were making against it so i think some good things ahead here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and the only thing id add is a couple of numbers right so the sales were up yearoveryear exceeding prepandemic levels across the categories acquisitions were up yearoveryear again bringing on new card customers into our family if you will revenues were down but you really have to look through the investments that were making in acquisitions and the rewards costs associated with those that impact that revenue being down if you adjust for the acquisition costs actually our revenues would be up yearover year so i agree completely with you jane which is were very pleased with the progress here were seeing similar momentum start to play through on the retail services side as well the sequential performance on average interestearning balances is a good signal for how things will play out and we continue to feel good about the growth we forecasted towards the back half of the year operator and our next question comes from andrew lim with société générale your line is open andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi thanks for taking my questions so i get the impression that maybe people are surprised by your nii guidance because in the past youve officially given it as based on a runoff balance sheet whereas it appears based on a static balance sheet and i think you mentioned a few quarters ago that if it was on the same basis a static balance sheet that your nii uplift would be about billion to billion for a 100basis point parallel shift mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 is that something youre still sticking to and then within the shape of that how much of that is due to the short term increasing by basis points i think youre much more sensitive to the shortterm going up is that something that you can disclose a rough figure on mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure and good morning yeah id like to separate kind of nii guidance from the ire sensitivity and disclosure that we have and so youre absolutely right and im not moving were not moving off of our ire disclosure at all the analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about basis points that we see somewhere around billion to billion of an increase kind of play through and as you know or as ive said before thats across currencies with about twothirds of that being to nonus currencies and the other third obviously being us so that is still our view from an ire point of view were not we havent changed that view operator and our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi followup i guess this is not new but the expenses are just so high and we havent heard the inflation number from others and maybe others were able to offset that a little bit more and the due to volume related when jane you mentioned you dont expect this levels capital markets to be sustained so i guess im just im griping about something thats been around for a while i get it you have the reg order you have the transformation you have business sales youve said you underinvested in the past and everything else but i mean you have basis points between your expense and revenue growth and it just seems so high but youre also guiding for what i think is like basis points of that spread for the full year so does that mean this is as bad as it gets and that spread should be narrowed and just some of those other inflation volumes expenses expenses generally because its frustrating for investors mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so mike why dont i take that and kind of try and talk through it so the first thing id say is that the growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance i just want to be clear that in investor day thats what we talked about we would love for the number to be different but we understand and we know that this is whats required to get the franchise to where it needs to be and so were taking those hard decisions were spending the money where we need to spend it were being diligent about that to make sure that were not being wasteful in that effort but we dont want to create or go through the things that weve gone through in the past in the way of underinvesting and so were going to avoid that the second thing is and you acknowledged that kind of in your reference to transformation and businessled investments on the structural investments spend i should say about half of that is from inflation so not the full a portion of it is also from nonconsent order risk and control spend that were making things like the financial crime unit things like cyber spend things like the work were doing around our wholesale credit operations important things and there are some productivity savings that play through that and then the final piece on the volumerelated is there are transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do in the trading side theyre spend that we make in order to drive in order to drive that activity and the citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 mix matters and so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter the mix of the markets activity impacts the level of volumerelated expenses thats generated through those transactions so those are a couple of things again were consistent with guidance we believe were on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of midsingle digits and were looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah and let me jump in as well mike because this is something mark and i have were very very aware of were managing it in excruciating detail on multiple dimensions we are taking the lessons that weve got to take some of the shortterm pain here in order to get us into the position we need to be in the medium term and the long term and from the stranded costs and the divestitures we know well have opportunities there we talked about at investor day also being in a position to simplify the management structure and take out some of the structural expenses there so this is going to be an area of continued focus for mark and i but well make sure that not only are we managing the arc and ensuring there is one but also that we generate the benefits from our shareholders from all of this and its something i feel exceedingly high accountability for as does the management team we get it operator and there are no more further questions i will turn the call over to jen landis for closing remarks jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you everyone for joining us today if you have any followup questions please reach out to ir enjoy the day thank you operator and this concludes citis first
