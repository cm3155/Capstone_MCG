spend per active account was higher for the year reflecting robust consumer demand across the broad range of products and services for which synchrony offers flexible financing we also acquired million new accounts and grew average active accounts by on a core basis a combination of strong consumer spread and some moderation in payment rate contributed to ending receivables growth of as expected credit continue to normalize across our portfolio with full year losses of still more than basis points below our underwriting target of to which is generally the level at which our riskadjusted margin is more fully optimized and finally synchrony continue to drive progress toward our longterm operating efficiency target reflecting the combined impacts of our cost discipline the

turn the call over to brian to discuss fourth quarter financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys strong fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of synchronys purposebuilt business model at work the diversification of our portfolio across industries and spend categories supported by sophisticated underwriting and disciplined credit management enable continued purchase volume growth that surpassed last years record level in addition the alignment of economic interest between synchrony and our partners through our retailer share arrangement is performing as intended excluding the impact of portfolio sales our rsa declined as credit losses continue to normalize and funding costs began to rise enabling synchronys delivery of consistent attractive risk adjusted returns as we have done for many years the scalability and efficiency of our dynamic technology platform is enabling operating leverage even as we invest in our business and synchronys strong balance sheet continue to support our customers and partners as their own needs evolved in combination these business drivers have continued to uniquely position synchrony in our ability to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers and our partners and consistent returns for our shareholders even as market conditions change lets now discuss synchronys fourth quarter financial results in greater detail purchase volume grew to billion reflecting a higher spend per account versus last year on a core basis purchase volume grew this continued strength in purchase volume was broadbased across our portfolio demonstrating the breadth and depth of our five sales platforms the compelling value propositions we offer and continued consumer demand at the platform level synchrony achieved doubledigit growth in our diversified value health wellness and digital platforms and singledigit growth in our home auto and lifestyle platforms more specifically in diversified value purchase volume increased driven by higher outofpartner spend in addition to partner performance and penetration growth the yearoveryear growth in digital purchase volume reflected the growth in average active accounts and greater customer engagement health wellness purchase volume grew compared to last year as we experienced broadbased growth in active accounts as well as higher spend per active account in home auto purchase volume increased generally reflecting strong spend in home and higher prices in furniture and in lifestyle purchase volume was higher driven by higher outofpartner spends turning to synchronys dual and cobranded cards where we continue to experience strong growth core purchase volume in these products grew versus last year and represented approximately of our total synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 purchase volume for the quarter as we discussed in the past our customers derive great value from our dual and cobranded cards because they combine bestinclass rewards with broad utility generally speaking approximately half of our outofpartner spend is comprised of nondiscretionary spend like bill pay discount store drugstore healthcare grocery and auto and gas and while we observed some minor category shifts during december for example from te related spend towards more clothing and other retail as well as reduction in auto and gas related spend towards more grocery and discount spend synchronys relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary outofpartner spend has remained essentially unchanged consistently strong consumer spend coupled with some moderation in payment rate contributed to higher average balances per account versus last year and growth in ending receivables our dual and cobranded cards accounted for of core receivables and increased from the prior year net interest income increased to billion primarily reflecting a increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables and higher loan receivable yields partially offset by the impacts of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of on a core basis interest and fees increased payment rate for the fourth quarter when normalizing for the prior year impact of the portfolios recently sold was approximately basis points lower than last year and approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear historical average net interest margin was in the fourth quarter a yearoveryear decrease of basis points the primary driver of the decrease was higher interestbearing liability costs which increased basis points to and reduced net interest margin by basis points the mix of interestearning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly basis points these headwinds were partially offset by a basis point improvement in loan yields which contributed basis points to net interest margin and our liquidity portfolio yields which contributed basis points rsas were billion in the fourth quarter and of average loan receivables the million yearover year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of and higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher net interest income provision for credit losses was billion for the quarter the yearoveryear increase reflected the impact of a growth driven million reserve build and higher net chargeoffs other income decreased million primarily reflecting the impacts of the prior years venture investment gain and the current quarters higher loyalty costs driven by our strong purchase volume other expenses increased to billion primarily driven by higher employee costs technology investments and transaction volume partially offset by million of asset impairments and certain incremental marketing investments recognized in the prior period the fourth quarter employee costs included certain additional compensation items of million higher stock based compensation and higher head count driven by growth and insourcing total other expense included million of additional marketing and growth reinvestment from second quarters million gain on sale proceeds as detailed in the appendix for our presentation the million gain on sale and reinvestment made in the second third and fourth quarters of this year were epsneutral for the full year our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was compared to last year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 putting it all together synchrony generated fourth quarter net earnings of million or per diluted shares we also generated a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of next ill cover our key credit trends on slide the external deposit data we monitor continues to reflect a slow reduction in consumer savings average deposit balances at the end of december were down approximately from their peak in march of but still approximately higher than 2021s average and higher than 2020s average on an annualized trend basis the savings decline that began around the march peak appears to have started to slow in december primarily in terms of its intensity turning to synchronys portfolio credit normalization continued as expected during the fourth quarters vintages are still performing better than and delinquency entry rates remain lower than the historical average at approximately of their prepandemic levels that said as consumer savings rates has decreased borrower payment behavior is reverting toward pre pandemic levels with normalizing entry rates into delinquency and higher roll rates in early delinquency stages following the chargeoffs this trend continued in the fourth quarter as payment rate normalization trends expanded from the nonprime segments of our portfolio into the prime and super prime segments where the average outstanding balances tend to be larger relative to periodend receivables our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and our 90plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year and our fourth quarter net chargeoff rate increased to from last year still remaining well below our underwriting target of to at which point portfolio credit risk is better optimized relative to profitability our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was down basis points from the in third quarter primarily reflecting the impact of an asset growth driven reserve builds which is more than offset by the impact of receivables growth in the denominator moving to another source of synchronys strength our capital liquidity and funding deposits at the end of the fourth quarter reached billion an increase of billion compared to last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources decreased by million altogether deposits represented of our funding while securitized and unsecured debt represented and respectively at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion or of our total assets consistent with last year we maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and our secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least deposits we expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth and will maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding we manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral that said as we continue to grow our deposit base and given the level of interest rates consumers are actively rotating from savings to cds this has had the effect of extending our deposit duration while making our balance sheet slightly liability sensitive synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 we will continue to manage interest rate risk through term maturities its also important to note through its mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level synchronys rsa will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business moving on to discuss synchronys capital position note that we previously elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies as a result starting this past january of and continuing in january of synchrony makes an annual transitional adjustment of approximately basis point to our regulatory capital metrics until january of the impact to cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet it should also be noted that the fasb cecl update for the accounting of tdrs becomes effective for synchrony as of january this accounting standard update eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for tdrs which previously followed a separate process using a discounted cash flow methodology to quantify the tdr specific reserve requirement synchronys adopting this update on a modified retrospective basis as of january based on our current estimate the adoption will result in approximately million reduction to our reserve balance which we recognize net of tax and equity the net impact of the adoption will contribute approximately basis point increase to our capital ratios from a capital metric perspective we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points lower than last years level of the tier capital ratio was on the cecl of transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year synchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns in the fourth quarter in total we returned million to shareholders through million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends as of quarter end our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending june was million synchrony remains wellpositioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan as we make further progress toward our targeted capital levels we look to develop our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stocks and the issuance of subordinated debt finally lets turn to our outlook for the full year which is summarized on slide of our presentation we expect strong consumer demand for the wide variety of products and services we finance to support continued broadbased purchase volume growth as excess consumer savings continue to decline yearoveryear purchase volume growth rate should slow payment rate should also continue to moderate but were still expected to remain above prepandemic levels throughout together these dynamics should contribute to ending receivables growth between and we expect our net interest margin to be between and for the full year and follow typical seasonal trends this outlook is based on fed funds rate of and incorporates the following five impacts during one the increase in interestbearing liabilities costs due to higher benchmark rates and the potential competitive pressures of higher retail deposit betas to address funding needs two a higher interest and fee yields partially offset by higher income reversals as delinquency and chargeoffs continue to normalize synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 three an increase in our liquidity portfolio yields primarily reflecting the higher benchmark rates four the fluctuation of mix of average loan receivables relative to average interestearning assets as driven by the seasonal growth trends and timing of our funding and five the fullyear impact of the portfolio sold during second quarter before we turn to our credit outlook it is important to note there are number of uncertainties that could change our expectations and the trajectory of credit normalization we have greater visibility for the first half of this year and any significant changes in the mediumterm macroeconomic backdrop would more likely impact portfolio credit trends in with regard to our portfolios credit trajectory in we expect most of the portfolio delinquency metrics to have reached normalized levels or equivalent to prepandemic levels by midyear accordingly the associated charge offs will reach prepandemic levels approximately six months later the seasonal impact of tax refunds and bonuses in the first half and the third quarters acceleration of receivables growth will likely lead to a decline in net chargeoff rate for q3 before credit losses rise and continue the normalization path through the fourth quarter given our expectation that delinquency metrics will reach their prepandemic levels by midyear we expect net chargeoffs to be between to for the full year still considerably below our prepandemic annual loss rate target of to we run multiple economic scenarios to inform our credit outlook as part of our normal business process our baseline reserve assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately by yearend we have quantitative overlays for the current uncertainty and possibility of a mild recession in this scenario we would expect the unemployment level closer to this is reflected in our fourth quarter reserve rate which is still higher than our day one cecl rate barring any significant changes in the macroeconomic environment we do not expect our portfolio to reflect our fully normalized annual loss rate target until accordingly we continue to expect reserve builds in to be generally asset driven and that the reserve rate will gradually migrate towards approximately as credit normalization brings our portfolio net chargeoffs back to that mean annual loss rate to which weve been underwriting rsa expense will continue to serve as a functional alignment of economic interest with our partners reflecting the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth offset by rising net chargeoffs as a result we expect rsa as a percent of average loan receivables to be between and should credit normalize at a slower rate than we expect rsas would likely come closer into the highend of that range and the extent that funding costs or net chargeoffs rise to the high end and beyond of our current assumptions we expect the rsa to come into the low end or lower than this range in terms of other expense we remain committed to delivering operating leverage such that expenses grow at a slower rate than net interest income our full year expectation is expenses will run approximately billion per quarter to the extent that receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 year well moderate our spending where appropriate while still prioritizing the best longterm prospects for our business as we demonstrated throughout this past year synchronys business and financial model is performing as its designed to do our proprietary data and analytics diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack allows to reach and improve more customers for the same level of risk while leveraging low customer acquisition cost and driving greater customer lifetime value our retailer share arrangements are aligning our partners economic interest with their own and in doing so enabling synchrony to deliver consistent riskadjusted returns through changing market conditions and our robust balance sheet is providing funding flexibility as they seek to provide continuity to our customers and partners when they need it most in short synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient riskadjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and partners evolve we remain on track to achieve our longterm financial operating targets as market conditions stabilize ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian looking to and beyond synchrony is wellpositioned to navigate the uncertainties of the

directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one from a followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from moshe orenbuch from credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much and thanks for all of the detail around the guidance and the performance brian i guess brian doubles you talked a lot about some of the enhancements to your products maybe could you just amplify a little bit as to how youre thinking about synchronys role with your partners in this current environment i mean it seems like this is an environment in which youre and what i hear from the retailers that theyre going to need your help more just talk a little bit about how to think about the things that you talked about that youre doing and how thats going to help synchrony and its shareholders brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure moshe thanks for the question youre absolutely right i think our partners in an environment like this tend to lean on us even more heavily there is a lot of uncertainty out there that weve all talked about in terms of consumer trends and behavior and what we can expect from inflation and just kind of the broad uncertainty around the macro environment and so our partners look at us and they say okay what are we doing to drive sales what are we doing to drive new accounts this is when they lean even more heavily on rewards programs and the credit customer as weve talked about in the past always is their best most loyal customer and so in this kind of environment this is where they really double down and we have really constructive discussions around should we be refreshing the val prop should we doing more promotions more offers are there new capabilities and new products that we should be introducing and weve had really great discussions with our partners particularly around the multiproduct strategy so the combination of being able to offer revolving credit product in installment buy now pay later loan and how those products work together and one of the things that as you know weve been very focused on in that multiproduct journey is creating an easy experience for the customer but also a really easy experience for the partner so how do you offer multiple products and use our datadriven analytics to make sure that the customer their customer is getting the right product the right offer at the right time and i think in an environment that were heading into that becomes even more important so going all the way back to our investor day we talked about that strategy we spent a lot of time on it and i do believe still to this day that the multiproduct strategy is the winning one and were hearing that from our partners they are highly engaged in it and i think over time its going to pay big dividends for synchrony and all of our stakeholders so thanks for the question moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 great and maybe just to flip this over to brian wenzel is as you kind of factor all of that into the financial aspect where are the areas you think that this could kind of help either already embedded in that guidance or things could be better as we go through brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks moshe for the question as i think about it that engagement really to drive the compelling value proposition linkage to the customer can really drive what i would say spend probably above what youd see in retail sales or in the general economy so that would help fuel a lower payment rate as well so i think you can see upside to the asset of to if that gains a lot of traction in moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks moshe operator well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc brian maybe to just start on the loan growth guidance can you maybe just unpack some of the drivers behind it i think you mentioned new business wins brian wenzel you talked about slowing payment rates and also maybe expectations for purchase volume growth and then i guess any color across which platform is expected to drive the growth just given the robust growth youve seen along with shifting views on inflation thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so thanks for the question ryan so i think as you think about our asset growth there is two dynamics that come into play one is you will see a slowing payment rate now again we dont expect the payment rate for the entire business to get back to historical levels during so that is one that will help you from an asset perspective but if you believe that the economy is going to get a little tougher the headwind then becomes will the consumer pull back on spending a little bit so i think those two dynamics kind of play with each other in how we think about synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 it again if the economy doesnt is stronger than we think then again i still think youll see slowing payment rate but youll see stronger sales kind of going in here and you could have upside in that scenario to the outlook ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe as my followup brian your comments on the rsa depending on the trajectory of credit so maybe just to clarify so were talking about to sic this year which is lower than the to i think you talked about it in investor day yet were still not back to normalized levels of credit until so my question is have the goalposts of the rsa moved down what are some of the moving pieces that would have driven that and is it possible that we could be operating below the level at some point thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks first ryan just to make sure were on the same page the guidance for full year is to and again i think you have a couple of things one you do have a little bit of the net interest margin coming down that plays through the rsa number one with the interestbearing liabilities cost going up two you have the increase in the net chargeoff rate kind of coming through three you have a little bit of the opex piece coming through and four you have growth in denominator with really receivables so i think that plays through to the extent your question can it operate below a level yes it can operate level but that would be more dependent upon trajectory of net chargeoffs and how much of that is offset through net interest margin again given the timing of losses were sitting here midjanuary which we have pretty good visibility really through midjuly now so there is an opportunity for it again weve given you the guidance we think is the best estimate for as we sit here today ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc appreciate the color brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks ryan operator well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning can you talk a little bit about regulatory risk specifically around what the cfpb might do on late fees any timing or kind of your updated thoughts brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure so look i think the timing thats been kind of speculated upon out there is pretty much in line with what we assume which is we might know something here in the first quarter but i think we probably wont have synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 an effective rule until late this year or early next year so again pretty much in line with our expectations were prepared for that i think weve talked about in the past that about or a little over of our late fees sit in programs that have an rsa so thats an offset obviously well work with our partners on that they have an incentive to help us offset the impact if there is one so were ready for it were preparing internally well see what comes out but i think well have some time between when we have some clarity and probably an effective rule like i said late this year early next year donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and can you talk a little bit about the relative health of the lowend consumer versus prime what youre seeing brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look i think internally we certainly talk about a kshaped recovery i think were certainly seeing that play out i think broadly the consumer is still healthy i think they still have savings were seeing really good spend patterns great spend on our products in particular last year was a record year in terms of purchase volume so generally we feel pretty good about the operating environment with that said clearly there is uncertainty as we move throughout the year depending on inflation and where rates go so were watching that very carefully our credit teams are highly engaged and theyre monitoring the portfolio to see where we need to make some tweaks and adjustments along the way i dont know brian if youd add anything to that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i think you covered it donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks brian brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks operator well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning brian wenzel i wanted to dig into some of the commentary on credit quality you mentioned youre assuming unemployment rate but the qualitative assumption is in the range for the reserve rate im just curious what kind of impact would there be to the chargeoff rate if the unemployment rate synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 reaches and then you mentioned or i guess does this mean that theres no impact to the reserve rate if you migrate to the unemployment brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question sanjay so the qualitative portion which brings you to the unemployment effective unemployment rate up to the call it level again we look at claims but that essentially says that in that environment there probably wouldnt be any form of significant rate related reserve increases again for the impact to net chargeoffs there is a timing issue here that happens so the unemployment rate have to move up pretty rapidly in the beginning part of the year to have a factor in the back half of the year which would impact in that chargeoff rate so if that happens youre probably more looking at some headwinds towards from a net chargeoff basis but again you should have that reserve for in the short term sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so really no change to the reserve rate just timing on the chargeoff rate brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i mean obviously we are most sensitive to unemployment claims obviously there are other things in the economy that we are sensitive to but that would be the biggest factor for us to have to relook at reserves and again i know theres a lot of questions on reserve rate dipping down thats a seasonal factor that happens every fourth quarter because of the denominator i mean were up in absolute dollars from third quarter to fourth quarter again youd expect as your receivables go down in the first quarter that rate to rise sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and just a followup question for brian doubles maybe you could just help us think about how youre managing the business as youre thinking about loan growth obviously very undecided on where the economy is going as a whole i think and then any flexibility you might have on expenses to the extent that we have a more adverse scenario brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure i mean look weve talked about this in the past that we try and manage the business really well through cycles and we try and provide a level of consistency to our partners in terms of how we underwrite and so if you look at the last couple of years were coming out of the absolute best credit environment weve ever seen in the history of the business and we didnt take an opportunity to underwrite a lot deeper and i think thats why you saw again a more consistent loan growth from us than maybe some others and thats really important to our business because if we take an opportunity to really underwrite deeper and take approval rates up then we know at some point in the future were going to have to pull back on that and we tried really hard not to do that again consistency is really important to our partners so we feel pretty good about the guide for next year the to growth we think that thats prudent thats not that doesnt assume significant changes in how were underwriting now clearly as thing change and we synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 see the macro environment play out differently than were contemplating right now then well go in and well make some tweaks and well make some adjustments but we feel pretty good about the to and look i think the one thing on expenses youve seen us be pretty disciplined over the years we had some opportunity last year to make some incremental investments we did that really happy with the return and the payback on those investments but we stay really disciplined there and if we head into a tougher environment in or then certainly thats an area that well look to pull back on if we have to sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks operator well take our next question from erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my question is relating to capital and capital distribution for as we think about ending the year at i guess its a two part question number one does your buyback trajectory get impacted by the macroeconomic uncertainty even though your receivables growth is set to slow in and secondarily is there an amount of cushion that management wants to hold against that target not necessarily for macro uncertainty but for potential opportunities in terms of purchases in case those arise portfolio purchases in case those arise brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes thanks erika so to your first question on the macroeconomic environment right now were going through the early stages of developing our capital plan that well submit to the federal reserve in the latter part of march so we go through that with that capital plan we run a number of different loss stresses and severe loss stresses and idiosyncratic stresses in order to inform us really of what the range of outcomes are and how comfortable we feel with the environment and again as we said throughout we feel very comfortable in the environment continuing on the capital plan that we laid out and submitted to the fed last march and got approved in april so we will use that to form again during the year we go through multiple stress scenarios so we continue to feel good even under a stress scenario that the targets and the environment that we will continue to operate with a very good capital plan so well do that to inform us with regard to the level of capital is our target now the first thing to remind you and others of is we have to continue to fully develop our capital stack right through incremental tier through a preferred and then obviously through tier whether that be sub debt or incremental preferred so we have to continue to develop the capital stack team to be able to achieve the cet1 target synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 and then secondarily i think every company operates with a little bit of operating range the real positive part of our business erika is that we generate a lot of capital each year which we can deploy back in and obviously getting down to the growth that wed anticipated when we talked to you back in october we came in at so were able to fund that growth and thats really we think very attractive returns that will continue to generate capital as we move into and beyond so yes there is some type of operating risk but again the target also has a buffer to it so you can certainly go through that buffer a little bit if you wanted to do an acquisition so thats not a floor its just a range in which we operate with and well continue to try to deploy capital in a manner thats in the best interest of all stakeholders erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for that and my second question is a followup to an earlier question about the reserve i just wanted to clarify fully understand the comment on the trajectory of losses from here however on the reserve if we did end up with an unemployment rate at the end of the year that is closer to versus i just wanted to make sure i understood this correctly will there will be an increase in the reserve rate thats more significant or does the qualitative take care of any potential increases from that baseline brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question erika and ill try to be clear here the is a baseline which we take from moodys effectively when we run it through the model youre probably more like there are qualitatively overlays that bring it effectively to right or closer to so in theory if you were to hit that there should not be raterelated provisioning it should just be growth related provisioning at that point so only if your outlook changed above you would anticipate more rate related increases erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks erika have a good day operator well take our next question from arren cyganovich with citi your line is open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks in your press release you noted that youd added or renewed programs including lowes which has historically been one of the largest partners you have can you talk a little bit about are you starting to push some of these renewals past which i know you had a lot of them locked in through and whats the competitive environment for these renewals today brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 yeah so look first i would say that were always looking to renew where we can at attractive terms for us and the partners so the teams that we have on the ground sitting with our partners every day you come across things where it makes sense to add some years to the deal investments we want to make changes in val props et cetera so our teams are out there every day finding ways to renew in ways that benefit our partners and benefit us so were thrilled to extend with lowes theyre one of our oldest clients i think this extension will take us over years which is pretty incredible when you think about it i would say competitively just more broadly its still competitive very competitive environment but i do think as you start to head into periods of uncertainty like were heading into now you do start to see the competition get even more disciplined and we all know and appreciate that were not going to be operating at half of our targeted loss rate like we saw the last couple of years and you start to see that discipline work its way into the competitive dynamics so i think thats good were a very disciplined debtor in these processes and its nice to see that kind of happen across the industry so we feel really good about how were positioned i think in times like this back to the earlier conversation youre really competing on capabilities and that combined with good price discipline across the industry is a good thing for us arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah operator well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc one question to followup on something you mentioned in the prepared remarks normalization you are seeing migrate into prime and super prime i think i heard you right there and i just wanted to understand if you were just talking there about the payment rate normalization or are you also talking about normalization in delinquencies synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 and your net chargeoff outlook maybe you could unpack what you meant a little bit more if you dont mind thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so as brian mentioned earlier not many will talk about it but there is what i would say a more kshaped recovered or were seeing it where the low rank consumer has been normalizing at a faster rate both id say from a payment rate behavior standpoint as well as a delinquency and chargeoff standpoint and as you continue to move away from the pandemic and stimulus you begin to see the other cohorts which is the prime and super prime which had already started to normalize continue that normalization trends i think the important part for us betsy is we think as we take a step back and think about the entire portfolio for a second if you look that historical 30plus and 90plus day delinquencies so prepandemic levels and applied it to our balances as you step through this year what youd see is a very linear normalization of delinquencies for us and again thats really the bottom end normalizing a little bit quicker now youre starting to see the top end but if you look at that linear pace beginning in the first quarter last year i mean were about of our pre pandemic delinquencies and has moved about percentage points each quarter so were not seeing an acceleration in normalization it just kind of is flowing through and thats on top of a larger balance but it is normalizing in a manner which we expected but again there is a little bit of a kshape recovery where were starting to feel again moving back all our vintages from on are performing better than our vintages in so we feel good that the normalization that were expecting is happening on a path that we expect betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and that was part of the followup was around the vintages so your vintages pretty similar and i guess the underlying question here is as the performance is coming in relative to what you had pre pandemic how much more room is there for opening up the credit box or pulling in incremental loan growth brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i mean if you break it apart for a second betsy the vintage and obviously the early part of thats performing the best right because thats when we put in refinements at the start of the pandemic because no one knew what was going to happen the latter part of and performing between that vintage and the so i think in all cases theyre doing better but again theyre slightly different under different underwriting standards i dont envision and brian talked about this the consistency that we have both in underwriting for origination but account management that were going to use as a growth lever i think we have a really diverse and attractive set of partners so we get spend across a multitude of different verticals and categories and then when you look at the fact that were really having have compelling value propositions and are aligning to our most loyal customers and our partners we dont have to use credit for a growth engine as opposed to others so i dont want to envision us using credit in opening up the credit box from here forward right now what were doing is were making modest refinements when we see things that concern us but were not doing anything across the board because we dont see it across the board in our portfolio synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks betsy have a good day operator well take our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you i just wanted to followup on some of the capital questions if we did see a rapid increase in unemployment from a base rate of to roughly or maybe somewhere around that level as we approach year end i mean would you start to consider your capital levels to have already embedded that type of unemployment rate or those types of assumptions of economic deterioration just given the stress test or do you feel like you need to be a little bit more cautious given the outlook could change rapidly in that type of environment brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so first of all thanks for the question kevin when we think about our capital plan and the stress test we run the unemployment rates that we use in those stress tests are significantly higher than so the isnt concerning on its face value relative to our capital levels what really we would look at and our risk committee and the board would look at is is there a reduced visibility into the macroeconomic environment where youre concerned or in the case where youre concerned about the level of net income being generated thats where you would come back to saying hey listen should i think about capital differently but remember these stress test models are built under a very severe scenario and as long as youre inside of that you should be able to continue on your capital plans and be able to weather it thats why it is there is a lot of buffers on top of the minimum requirement so again itll be well north of before we get concerned kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you and then in regards to a followup to that on the ma i think you mentioned that the valuations are finally normalizing are you seeing any attractive opportunities start to develop whether its portfolios or other acquisition potential targets given what we see out there today brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look i think youre right i mean were finally seeing valuations check up pretty significantly in some areas that were interested in our business development team has a very active ma screen so thats certainly something that we look at youve seen us do small acquisitions where we can kind of leverage our scale allegro is a great example of that pets best is a great example of that synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 and weve grown those businesses very significantly since we acquired them but were a very disciplined buyer as well those were very modest in terms of the capital outlay but we saw a lot of future growth and earnings potential those are the things that we like to do and so if we can do more acquisitions like that wed certainly look to do that but were a very disciplined buyer when it comes to allocating capital to ma kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you brian brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah operator well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys and thanks very much for taking my question i guess first one is just on the nim you talked about deposit durations changing and so forth maybe can you just detail to us is the shift in deposit prices mostly over what your outlook is there and any characteristic of kind of the duration of deposits now versus where it has been brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question john so ill deal with the latter part of the question first so yes we have seen an extension of the duration little bit people have rotated into cds and we see people into call it that 18month 19month duration so it slid out a little bit i wouldnt say materially with regard to pricing as we move forward i mean obviously when we give the nim guidance here what we saw in was really a change in the landscape right you had a lot of people trying to manage betas in the beginning part of and then when they felt the outflow of deposits during the year got more aggressive with regard to price and i think you saw a lot of that happen in the latter part of the year its been very stable now so our outlook includes deposit betas getting a little bit worse than they have been from here particularly on the cds so again this is going to be something that were really going to watch relative to the feds actions at the next couple of meetings and what their guidance is with regard to terminal rate that they have out there but we planned for in this guidance to have betas deteriorate in john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats helpful thank you and then a second question maybe can you characterize you have some traditional partners traditional retail partners like lowes and so forth and then digital platforms like amazon and paypal is there anything worth noting about the general trends in the different types of platforms and how that might manifest itself over the course of synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial look so obviously we serve a very broad range of partners as you indicated and clearly you saw really strong growth in digital strong growth in health wellness we would expect that to continue ill tell you where you see the biggest difference john is actually in how we engage with those partners and our solutions inside of those partners differ quite a bit venmo and paypal is a great example where were completely integrated through our api architecture and if youre inside of the paypal and venmo app you dont know if its something that we built or something that paypal built it is really seamless to the customer and thats really important and i think that really helps make that experience a good one for the customer and helps us drive growth over the long term and you compare and contrast that with what were trying to do in the onetomany space like with clover and other solutions where we want to make it really easy for our smaller partners to leverage the financial products that we have and we have to do that by building it once and then scaling it across the enterprise so you really run the gamut from highly customized fully integrated api architecture to a onetomany solution which just makes it really easy for our partners to offer our financing products so thats where you see the biggest difference between our partners and the partners that we have today ill tell you at any given time youre going to have some partners that are doing really well and just crushing it and youre going to have some partners that are maybe struggling a little bit as i said earlier heading into uncertain times like this the credit program becomes even more important and thats consistent across the board so heading into an environment like this we feel like were really wellpositioned to help our partners succeed john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for the color brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thanks john operator well take our final question today from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my question i just want to talk a little bit more about the reserve rate outlook end of the quarter day one was there was a suggestion that it will sort of trend back towards over time roughly in line with day one levels i think what that implies to me is that as weve gone through the learning process on the cecl model versus day one that there has not been a material evolution in terms of sort of loss expectations but the reserve rates will sort of on an applestoapples basis be consistent with day one is that the right way to think about things and can we just put that in context of the normalization over the next months synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2023 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question rick so i think if you looked at the assumptions that went into the day one cecl model versus the assumptions that are in the model today theyre very close to each other so i do think that youre in a position where there is not a significant difference right now where there is a difference is the macroeconomic overlays that we have in here that are much more significant than what they were on day one so as that macroeconomic environment clears right either through the losses or through the fact that we were more conservative or things didnt play out the way we thought youre going to begin to migrate back towards that day one level now remember in cecl at the end of the day you forecast out for a reasonable and supportable period right that you have losses and then you migrate to your mean so at the end of the day that mean hasnt changed for us in our expectations i mean obviously id like to say we had a normal period during cecl but unfortunately over the last twoplus years we have not so again well revisit at some point in the future what the mean loss rate is but again that does play into the fact that youll ultimately migrate and they should come back in line absent mix richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats very helpful and i think like everybody were all exhausted of living through unprecedented times and returning to normal would be nice brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i agree with you kevin sic rick brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial agree with that rick brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial rick sorry rick richard
