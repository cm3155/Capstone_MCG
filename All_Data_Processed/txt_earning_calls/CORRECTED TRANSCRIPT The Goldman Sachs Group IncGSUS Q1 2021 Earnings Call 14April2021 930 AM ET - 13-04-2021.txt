franchise continued to be evident as we delivered net earnings of billion record quarterly earnings per share of and a return on equity of and a return on tangible equity of the highest in over a decade our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength of our franchise in the supportive environment which we operated during the quarter these results also evidence our successful execution towards the firms strategic priorities we maintained our leading global positions across ma and equity underwriting we delivered the best performance in global markets in a decade with strength in ficc and equities driven by solid client activity across our platform and reinforced by last years market share gains the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 in asset management we recognized significant net gains across our public and private equity positions and we continued to harvest onbalance sheet investments in our efforts to transition the business to more thirdparty assets where we are making progress in raising funds across a range of investing strategies in wealth management we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultrahigh net worth pwm clients while we further scale our personal financial management business and in consumer we continue to make strong progress on our vision to create the leading digital consumer banking platform this quarter we launched marcus invest in the us our digital investment offering which provides consumers access to diversified investment portfolios with as little as a investment the customer response and uptake since launch has been positive and we are focused on scaling the platform were also working toward the launch of digital checking in the us and marcus invest in the uk importantly we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet as we continue to deploy our resources to support clients amid an evolving and dynamic market backdrop with that let me turn now to the operating environment on page as anticipated we saw improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop during the first quarter which was supported by the continued accommodative fiscal and monetary policies of central banks and governments around the world at this stage it is clear to me that the us is poised for a strong recovery this year led by consumer spending that is rebounding to precovid levels this sentiment is reflected in the capital markets with us equities hovering at or near records and bolstered by recent us employment data and our economist forecast on gdp growth despite these positive developments we recognize that the operating backdrop will undoubtedly evolve and that much of the global economic recovery will depend on the progress around covid19 while the rollout of vaccines is well underway in the us and the uk distribution has been challenged in a number of other countries around the globe and the prospect of new variants adds to potential concerns around the trajectory of the economic recovery as you would expect we remain vigilant to risks across markets we are mindful of elevated valuation levels across certain asset classes increased volatility in certain singlename stocks and are aware of the inflationary risks inherent in the actions being taken to stimulate continued growth in the economy let me now also take a moment to share my views on a few important topics where ive been fielding questions from clients and other stakeholders first on the events related to archegos capital this was a case of an investor with highly concentrated and leveraged positions this is not the first time weve seen a situation like this and it likely wont be the last we have robust risk management that governs the amount of financing we provide for these types of portfolios our risk controls all of which were put in place long before the march events worked well we identified the risk early and took prompt action consistent with the terms of our contract with the client i am pleased with how the firm handled it and its a reflection of the engagement and communication of teams across goldman sachs both in the business and on the control side of our firm these events raised reasonable questions around market practice and transparency they are worthy of debate and we intend to play a constructive role in that dialogue next on spacs we continue to believe that providing sponsors a mechanism to access public markets for capital formation is an innovation thats here to stay however as a meaningful participant in this market we will continue to be thoughtful regarding the transactions we underwrite with a particular focus on the quality of sponsors sponsor economics investor protections and disclosure we believe the industry should evolve on these important issues in the interest of more efficient and transparent markets the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 i also want to touch on the topics of cryptocurrency blockchain and the digitization of money as activities in these areas progress there will be significant disruption and change in the way money moves around the world many central banks are looking at digital currencies and working to apply this technology to the local markets and determine the longerterm impact on global payment systems theres also significant focus on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin where the trajectory is less clear as market participants evaluate their possibility as a store of value at goldman sachs we continue to look for ways to expand our capabilities to support our clients needs and evaluate applications to improve our organizational efficiency of course we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines for example we cannot own bitcoin or trade it as principal goldman sachs will play a role in these innovations as they are important to our clients and important to the future of global financial systems another topic coming up in stakeholder conversations is sustainability we remain steadfast in our commitments to sustainable finance central to our purpose as an organization our programs are commercially attractive and utilize our expertise and capital to support all of our stakeholders during the quarter we issued our first sustainability bond where we raised million the proceeds of which will be allocated towards initiatives aimed at accelerating climate transition and advancing inclusive growth we also launched one million black women an initiative that im very proud of and through which the firm will commit billion in direct investment capital and million in philanthropic capital for capacitybuilding grants over the next decade to narrow the opportunity gaps for black women in the united states separately we also committed an additional million to launch with gs our program designed to invest in diverseled companies and fund managers bringing our total commitments to billion finally i want to take a few minutes to comment on our people i continue to hear from clients that the quality and dedication of our people is one of our great differentiators the firms quarterly results are product of our client focus and the dedication of the employees of goldman sachs day in and day out notwithstanding the challenges that they have all faced as we mark one year into the covid19 pandemic our people have rallied to the needs of our clients i would like to thank my colleagues around the world i am in awe of their performance and of our results this quarter due to their hard work dedication and our culture of teamwork it will always be a priority for our firm to attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients and execute on our strategy we have a vibrant partnership and a deep bench of talent across the organization many will spend their entire career with us some will even become clients of the firm this is a virtuous ecosystem that has been in place for decades it is also aligned with the evolution of our partnership strategy where were working to continue to make the partnership more aspirational i recognize there is an enormous amount of discussion about how companies will operate their businesses post pandemic for goldman sachs our people operate at their best when they are forging close bonds with colleagues and furthering the apprenticeship culture that has defined us we have found that the best way to do that is to work together in person on a regular basis let me be clear achieving the objective of bringing our colleagues back to the office is not inconsistent with the desire to provide our people with the flexibility they need to manage their personal and professional lives which is the way we have always run this firm and given the experience of the past year i am more confident than ever in our ability to facilitate this approach going forward the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 over the course of the past few months we have been welcoming thousands of colleagues back to the office in a manner consistent with safety guidelines in each city in which we operate we have implemented testing and other protocols across our offices to make for a safer work environment and to provide those returning to the office with a sense of confidence in their return importantly i look forward to increasing the number of employees returning as vaccination programs around the world expand and we welcome new joiners to the firms offices this summer regarding our junior bankers and others in the organization who have been working tirelessly to support our clients and at times have been overburdened ive been passionate about the experience of our junior people throughout my career as you can now see from our results client activity is extraordinarily high and i fully appreciate how busy our people have been this has been exacerbated by the isolation of working remotely in a covid19 environment to address this we are taking concrete actions including additional hiring reallocating resources and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries in this connected world we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that goldman sachs is a place where we work very hard to serve our clients but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and wellbeing in closing im very pleased with how our people delivered for our clients and drove attractive returns for our shareholders im confident in the state of our client franchise and the progress we are making as we execute our strategic priorities with that i will turn it over to stephen stephen m scherr chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning let me begin with our summary results on page during the first quarter the firms performance reflected meaningful strength across all four of our business segments in investment banking clients remained very active in raising capital particularly in the equity markets and we witnessed high levels of ma activity amid elevated strategic dialogues in global markets we saw strength across all products and regions as client engagement remained high in asset management record performance was attributable to gains from our equity investments particularly as we harvested private equity positions in an attractive market we also saw doubledigit revenue growth yearoveryear in our consumer wealth management segment for a third consecutive quarter as we further expand our wealth capabilities and scale our consumer offering turning to specific business performance on page let me begin with investment banking investment banking produced record quarterly net revenues of billion up versus a year ago financial advisory revenues of billion rose versus last year on increased transaction closings in the quarter during the quarter we maintained our number one league table position as we participated in over billion of announced transactions over billion ahead of our next closest competitor and closed over deals for approximately billion of deal volume the bigger headline in investment banking again this quarter was equity underwriting where we generated a record billion in revenues over four times greater than the levels a year ago we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting with our volumes climbing to nearly billion across roughly deals including over initial public offerings for companies across all markets like coupang in korea inpost in poland and bumble in the us the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 our equity underwriting market share increased more than basis points during the quarter largely driven by improved share in ipos we experienced strong activity this quarter in followons and new products including our participation in a growing number of spac transactions in debt underwriting net revenues were million up from a year ago driven by strong activity levels particularly in leveraged finance and assetbacked transactions in addition our engagement with sectors impacted by covid including airlines and hospitality was high notwithstanding the significant realization of revenue in the quarter our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at record levels with sequential growth supported by sustained ma activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions revenues from corporate lending were million down versus the first quarter of last year which included significant gains on hedges maintained with respect to our relationship loan book revenues in the quarter reflect net interest income including from transaction banking and fees from relationship lending partially offset by approximately million of losses on hedges as spreads tightened modestly moving to global markets on page our franchise exhibited broadbased strength across businesses in both ficc and equities net revenues were billion in the first quarter up versus a year ago and the highest since during the quarter we benefited from a supportive marketmaking environment and facilitated considerable client activity turning to ficc on page six first quarter net revenues were billion up versus year ago driven by a increase in intermediation where we experienced healthy client flows and demonstrated strong risk management and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year in mortgages revenues rose significantly bolstered by solid results in agency mortgages and residential loans and high levels of client engagement as the business continues to diversify its revenue across marketmaking loan origination and financing in commodities higher yearonyear performance was driven by solid inventory management across products amid volatile markets and healthy client flows in rates revenues rose amidst strong risk management and client engagement particularly on the back of anticipated fiscal activity in the us and diverging central bank actions during the quarter in credit revenues were up versus a year ago as the business benefited from continued improvement in credit spreads while client activity remained healthy amid robust primary issuance we also saw increase in volumes related to our automated bond pricing engine and growing activity in electronic trading in currencies revenues fell due to lower activity versus a strong quarter a year ago though client engagement remained high across both the g10 and emerging markets franchises turning to equities net revenues for the first quarter were billion up versus a year ago as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients and intermediated risk with discipline equities intermediation produced net revenues of billion up reflecting the global scale and breadth of our client franchise and aided by elevated client volumes across cash and derivatives as well as strong risk management in cash we facilitated client flows across high and lowtouch channels and executed a number of block trades for clients during the quarter in derivatives we produced record results as we saw solid activity in flow and structured transactions across both the us and europe the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 equities financing revenues of billion were the best in over a decade rising yearoveryear average balances in our prime business grew to record levels as we supported clients amid the volatility and market events of the first quarter as we continue to grow our prime business we are well aware of the risks inherent in that business and the resources including liquidity that are consumed while we avoided losses related to recent events involving archegos capital as david noted the situation underscored the potential risks of the business and the corresponding importance of our risk infrastructure and control systems as to forward expectations for global markets it remains difficult to predict client activity while we do not expect the pace of activity in the first quarter to necessarily persist for the balance of the year we believe the high levels of primary issuance the current trajectory of economic recovery and diverging central bank policies particularly in emerging markets could continue to support elevated client activity our confidence on the forward of global markets rests largely on the market share gains generated last year through a deepening of client relationships and our ongoing investment in technology platforms to enhance client experience and drive efficiencies as we have noted previously this progress has improved the structural return profile of the business independent of the wallet opportunity moving now to asset management on page in the first quarter we generated record revenues of billion management and other fees totaled million up versus a year ago driven by higher average assets under supervision partially offset by fee waivers on money market funds incentive fees of million were lower versus a strong yearago quarter equity investments produced billion of net gains including appreciation across our public investments and marks related to eventdriven activity in our private equity portfolio such as sales or capital raises more specifically on our billion public equity portfolio we had gains of roughly million this quarter we disposed of over billion of positions given attractive market conditions despite the quantum of public positions sold in the quarter the more moderate decline in the size of our portfolio reflects the impacts of ipos in our private portfolio and market appreciation across our billion private equity book we generated gains of nearly billion sic billion from various positions more than twothirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio of companies including fundraisings capital market activities and outright sales additionally we had operating revenues of million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities we announced or closed on dispositions of private assets of billion in the quarter bringing the total private sales since our investor day to billion there is an implied billion of capital associated with those assets additionally we have line of sight on nearly billion of incremental asset sales despite these actions and as i mentioned on our january earnings call we increased the equity attributed to asset management as a result of our ccar stress test this change was driven by our dynamic capital attribution methodology which takes various regulatory constraints into consideration on the forward a continued reduction in balance sheet positions will produce a more meaningful impact on attributed equity reduction importantly we remain on track to achieve our net reduction in segment capital consistent with what we presented at our investor day to below billion by the ongoing harvesting of our investment portfolio is consistent with our strategy of migrating our business to thirdparty versus onbalance sheet investing and attractive market valuations have accelerated some sales we are keen to continue such activity as it would be capitalaccretive to the firm that said dispositions at attractive the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 levels now will diminish gains from sales in forward quarters we are mindful of that tradeoff and are working to offset the revenue impact in subsequent years as we look to realize increasing fee income from the number of alternative funds being formed and invested finally in asset management net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were million on revenues from nii and gains on fair value debt securities and loans this reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments let me now turn to page where we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters our equity and cie portfolios remain highly diversified by sector geography and vintage and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with loans in the segment largely secured moving to page consumer wealth management produced billion of revenues in the first quarter up versus a year ago management and other fees of billion rose versus last year reflecting higher assets under supervision which rose to billion consumer banking revenues grew to million in the first quarter up versus last year reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit growth next lets turn to page for our firmwide assets under supervision and firmwide management and other fees total aus increased to a record trillion during the quarter up over billion versus a year ago the sequential increase of billion was driven by billion of longterm inflows and billion of liquidity inflows our total firmwide management and other fees grew by versus the first quarter of to billion on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion for the first quarter higher versus a year ago reflecting an increase in interestearning assets and lower funding costs next lets review loan growth and credit performance across the firm our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion up billion sequentially driven by residential real estatewarehouse and wealth management lending in the first quarter provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of million this includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop and loss expectations partially offset by portfolio growth including approximately million in provisions related to the pending acquisition of loan receivables as part of our credit card partnership with general motors expected to launch by yearend next lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses were billion while our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions fell to from in the first quarter of last year compensation expense increased reflecting strong performance noncompensation expenses were up only versus last year as an increase in transactionbased and technology expenses was largely offset by a decline in litigation and travel and entertainment expenses as well as lower expenses related to our consolidated investment entities overall our efficiency ratio for the quarter was reflecting the operating leverage in our business we remain focused on our expense discipline in a payforperformance culture as well as our expense initiatives where we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for further savings our effective tax rate in the quarter was primarily reflecting the impact of equitybased compensation of approximately million as noted previously we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 approximately i should note that we continue to monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the us on the federal and state level turning to our capital levels on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach down basis points sequentially the decline was driven by increased lending and higher market rwas as we stepped in to serve clients partially offset by strong earnings in the quarter we returned a total of billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion and approximately million in common stock dividends our book value per share rose to a record while the federal reserve has extended the limitations in place on share repurchases and dividend increases we nonetheless expect to continue our repurchase plans in the second quarter close to the levels of the first quarter and well evaluate an increase to the dividend as permitted turning to the balance sheet total assets ended the quarter at trillion higher versus last quarter as we supported client activity we maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging nearly billion on the liabilities side our total deposits rose to billion up billion versus last quarter notably consumer deposits surpassed billion during the quarter our longterm debt rose by billion driven by billion of benchmark issuance given the growth in our balance sheet outside of bank entities particularly due to accretive deployment opportunities in our prime business we now expect benchmark issuances to be modestly higher than maturities and redemptions this year in conclusion our first quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise we remain confident that execution of our strategic priorities will continue to drive a better client experience more durable revenues and strong returns for shareholders with that well now open up the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much i appreciate your comments on the capital freed up on the equity investment sales the question i have is i dont remember every number but it looks like some of those sales or a lot of those sales came from the older vintages which is good i think but now with most of the book or all the book six years or younger does that slow the monetization process i know you mentioned you had line of sight on billion more maybe you could talk about how much capital would be associated with that billion and maybe how the pipeline looks for thirdparty capital raise for the remainder of the year stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure glenn thanks for the question so let me just go through the numbers so were all level set in the quarter we closed on about billion of balance sheet reduction producing about million of ae relief and as i noted in the prepared remarks since our investor day weve disposed of balance sheet positions totaling billion that produced about billion of relief as well in terms of line of sight as i said we have a view into about billion of balance sheet reduction my view is that the capital attachment associated with that billion would be i would say well in excess of about billion probably close to billion in terms of ae relief there as to the profile vintage and otherwise i think its important to recognize that in pursuing the strategy of migrating to more thirdparty funds were going to look across the portfolio regardless of vintage of opportunities particularly in this market to advance its not only in the pursuit of course of that strategy but equally it reduces the capital density of that business and holds the promise of reduced capital that the firm would be required to hold overall and so two components in the context of what were trying to achieve strategically if you look at what weve done just on the last part of your question in terms of fundraising youll remember that through we noted that we had raised funds approximating billion taking that and extending it through the first quarter were up just north of about billion and are looking to deploy that now where obviously management fees get paid on deployment and investment of that fundraising and so the roster of ambition of what were going to do this year is quite real were confident in our ability to achieve it and this is all obviously part and parcel of meeting what i was talking about which is as we see the harvest of positions now and take that revenue in we will see compensation for that if you will in the context of management fees as we grow and deploy capital in the alternative space glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i definitely appreciate all that color thank you maybe a quick followup just quickly on composition of that pipeline that you talked about i think i heard in your remarks that ma is pretty darn good but underwriting actually is not bad also i guess my question is how dependent is fulfillment of that pipeline on getting past this the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 current spac indigestion here that we have im just looking for a little more color on fulfillment of that pipeline thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well if you look at our overall backlog which as i noted is at record levels i would say that notwithstanding very high level of revenue recognition certainly in the investment banking segment were nonetheless seeing the backlog replenishment at extraordinarily high levels and so thats really the sort of best picture forward if you will in terms of what our clients are engaged in doing i think on the forward as it relates for example to global markets there its difficult to say as i noted in the comment and david did as well its hard to know what the market opportunity will be the comparative set of results second and third quarter last year versus this will be challenging just given the volatility we saw last year in those quarters i think the confidence were taking in terms of substitutability of results lies in our market share and we have picked up market share across global markets across investment banking both in financial advisory and equity capital markets and we will rely on that to capture kind of our fair share or better of the opportunity set presented operator your next question comes from the line of christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous good morning david and stephen and first let me just echo the sentiments on heather shes been truly exceptional in the ir role so will be sorely missed on to my questions i guess the first one is on the trading businesses just to follow up on the what you just said in terms of market share gains it seems like the market share gains are actually accelerating in trading and im just curious if theres any more color really on what exactly is driving ebitda gains in the quarter or over the last year just a bit more specifics and then i know both you and david have talked about the sustainability issue around trading but it feels like trends are slowing a little bit here in april as we move into the summer so just any sort of thoughts around what you think will support strength for the rest of the year thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so christian ill start and thanks for the question first and ill start at a high level and then stephen will probably give you some more granular data but at a high level one of the things weve been very focused on over the last two and half years is the client centricity of our business and trying to really look at the way clients experience us look at it holistically see how were serving their needs holistically youve heard us talk about our one gs mantra our ability to bring the whole organization together to deliver better for clients and one of the things that im hearing consistently from clients as i reach out and spend time with clients is that they feel like theres been a meaningful change in the kind of broad client service theyre getting our focus on them the resources were getting giving or bringing to them the coordination of all that and i think that has contributed meaningfully that client centricity that culture is contributing meaningfully to market share gains the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 you know and weve put it forward that we talked about looking at the top accounts in global markets we gave you data last quarter on our progress against those accounts being top three against those accounts that is a kpi we continue to track we made progress last year and were committed to making further progress this year and so i think that also has an impact on this in addition then obviously you have the market activity thats generated and so we get the benefit of those market shares gains against that activity on your second question with respect to kind of activity looking forward what id say was the first quarter was an extraordinary quarter i dont think that the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter but i will say that activity levels continue to be elevated from what i would say was a precovid activity level by a meaningful amount and i think as we said in the script that the environment the monetary fiscal stimulus and in addition the economic recovery continues to paint a relatively constructive background but i dont think the expectation should be for it to continue at the pace we saw in the first quarter stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc so christian just to pivot off of davids comments all of which ill give to you and are a reflection or a product of the client centricity that david was speaking to first of all across the equities business in global markets i think were seeing a very clear consolidation of share in and among a discrete number of banks in the us among which we are one we saw elevated prime levels part of the strategy that weve been pursuing and as i noted in my comments record prime levels that contributed to meaningful uptick in equity financing even on the last call i had noted that over the course of across global markets we had picked up about basis points of wallet share across the patch and then when you look at ill just take two individual businesses in ficc just to pivot to ficc for a moment first of all if you look at mortgages the interesting thing about mortgages is that this business has now sort of pivoted away from sort of straight marketmaking and is now itself engaged in financing and loan origination and so doing more for more clients has been kind of the signature if you will of just expanding in the mortgage space that has grown that business and then if you look at credit we have picked up meaningful market share both in cash and loans in the context of what were doing and then the last thing i would say which i think is a contributor to enhanced share client engagement and the like has been what weve done in the development of platforms and credit is a good example of that where portfolio trading has grown quite considerably our place in it is quite high and so again its all as david is saying client centricity and engagement with clients and meeting clients where they care to execute platforms being a good example christian bolu q analyst autonomous great thanks for the color stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure christian bolu q analyst autonomous the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 maybe shifting on to expenses and expense management looking forward i mean id argue that the opportunity set across pretty much all your businesses today are much bigger than certainly when you much bigger today than when you set out some of those expense targets at investor day in early and im just wondering how youre thinking about continuing along the path for those expense targets versus capitalizing on revenue opportunities that are ahead of you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure so the way i would think about expenses is the following first of all in noncomp expense more broadly there should be no doubt that we have a very keen focus on controlling our expense base im saying that independent of the efficiencies that we laid out at investor day which ill come on to but our asreported noncomp expense was up ex litigation up and within that literally the totality of the increase in expenses were related to transactionbased expenses so bce relating to elevated levels in global markets and our technology spend and so i think on the forward you should expect that where transaction activity is high where were meeting our clients where market opportunity is large that variable expense will continue to fluctuate consistent with the market and will carry us there the second piece ill comment on is just the billion of expense initiative again independent of the daytoday focus on noncomp expense and there we continue to make progress in all of the areas that we had talked about including our real estate footprint as we just announced that were opening up offices in birmingham we did that as it relates to hyderabad all of that is a component piece of what were trying to achieve in the billion of expenses the last piece id say is the operating leverage that exists with compensation as weve said many many times we pay for performance and so that lever is always available to us as and to the extent we see revenue turn down relative to the kind of performance weve otherwise seen in this quarter operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start with a question on capital now how does the fed decision not to extend slr relief inform your capital management priorities and maybe just give us a sense as to where youre comfortable running on that measure since some of the areas where you noted some gains like prime are clearly going to be impacted by the prospect of potentially slr being binding and then just on riskbased ratios as well if you could just speak to how youre thinking about the rwa trajectory as you continue to execute on the planned equity investment sales the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure so first on slr just to be clear that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us just to be clear about it obviously at the holdco at the bank we stand higher than both of the minimums and dont find that to be a binding constraint to us and so i would say that at both levels we have ample growth capacity in terms of balance sheet growth before that comes on to the horizon as being an issue for us so slr not the issue that it is for some of the other commercial banks in terms of rwa growth i think that youll see that commensurate with the nature and level of activity thats there the one thing i do want to point out is that risk control and risk calibration remains unchanged it is as disciplined as you would expect it to be notwithstanding rwa growth so the opportunity set thats been presented causes us to extend balance sheet and grow riskweighted assets commensurate with that opportunity but without compromise to the kind of risk levels that we find i mean the thing i would say steve on this is that if you look at growth in the firm and you look at growth in balance sheet in the service of our clients as davids been talking about the resource input to this has been maintained so as to protect the risk flank of the firm were sitting with elevated levels of liquidity at gcla north of billion we sit in an ample capital position obviously elevated by where the minimums sit but within in an offensive mode and a buffer prepared to deal and engage with our clients marry those two resource sort of points alongside risk controls that david spoke about and we feel quite comfortable with the rwa growth were experiencing and keeping it in control and checked from a risk point of view steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and for my followup i guess both for you and david just as a followup i guess really to christians earlier question just on trading and ib normalization i know this has been asked a number of different ways on recent calls but just given the sheer pace of share gains and david some remarks you actually made at a conference this quarter noting that industry fee pool should normalize above levels it does feel to us like those two factors alone should support more than billion in higher run rate ib and trading revenues which actually compares to a target for incumbent business growth of just billion to billion so clearly some of the targets that you outlined at investor day on the revenue side do appear quite conservative just given the sheer level of progress i was hoping you could speak to your confidence around the ability to drive better growth in the incumbent businesses relative to those targets and maybe if you feel like that north of billion in higher run rate ib and trading is a reasonable expectation given the underlying trends that youre seeing as well as the improved and deepened client penetration the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so steve appreciate the question and you think about this in a similar way that we do weve always talked about how longterm market cap growth has led to longterm growth in our business broadly but youve got to look at it over long periods of time i think there are a variety of structural things that has supported growth in our core businesses and i think were seeing some of that im not going to comment specifically on your numbers although i think that your numbers as you point out set very reasonable expectations for us to meet our medium term targets that we set at investor day so ill start by saying i am extremely confident of our ability to meet our mediumterm targets that we set at investor day we also said at investor day that that is not our longerterm aspirations and as the market continues to evolve as we come out of the pandemic as we have more clarity on how the world sets out moves forward well give you clear communication about our longerterm expectations for our ability to drive the franchise forward but as we did prepandemic at investor day i reiterate now we do see opportunities to drive the franchises forward and drive higher returns over the long term than what our current mediumterm targets are operator your next question comes from the line of mike carrier with bank of america michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thanks for taking the questions first just a biggerpicture question following on that last one in terms of the sustainability of some of the things that were seeing in trading and banking we havent seen this level of gdp growth in terms of the forecasts for a very long time so just wanted to get your like historical perspective on how this cycle compares can that drive more activity and then david i think you mentioned higher inflation as one of the risks something that youre monitoring so i guess just if were in an environment where that starts to ramp up how do you expect that to impact activity levels david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so appreciate the question mike and theres no question if you look at a broader historical perspective growth in activity levels in our business have been correlated to robust gdp growth around the world and so id state quite clearly and i said in the prepared remarks that we think that were going to have very very robust economic growth in the second half of into as vaccines continue to accelerate as we come out of the pandemic as we move forward theres no question that there is meaningful consumer pentup demand consumers have reasonable liquidity and savings higher than they did going into the pandemic and we expect that all of that economic activity and that pickup in economic activity is a constructive backdrop for our business theres no question given the monetary and fiscal actions that theres an increasing risk of inflationary activity we all are watching very carefully comments from central banks around the world as we look forward i think in my opinion theres no question that we will see an increase in inflation the question is how much how quickly and how we respond to that and i think its early its very early to speculate but there is a scenario in the distribution where it would accelerate more quickly and actions would have to be taken that would create more headwinds for our business i dont see that as obvious on the nearterm horizon as we look through this year and we continue to come out of the pandemic but i do think its a risk issue for markets that well have to continue to watch very closely the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc great thanks and stephen just a quick one follow up on the asset management business following glenns question just the fees the management fees sequentially were a bit lower i think you mentioned money market fee waivers how significant was that and then on the alternative fundraising how much of the funds that are being raised do you generate fees on committed capital versus deployed capital thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so on the money market comment it was approximately million in fee waivers and bear in mind very common practice as you know throughout the industry so nothing unusual about that on the alternatives space the management fees that well take in are on deployment of the investable capital thats already beginning and so youll continue to see that i did note that on one of the charts that we show which looks at firmwide assets under supervision and firmwide management and other fees its a slide where my ambition is to disclose more particularly as these alternative funds become deployed we can start to share more with you about how much of that management fee across the whole of the business never mind the segment in which it sits but across the whole of the firm is being generated by this strategic pivot operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hi there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions the first one is on the backlog you indicated that the backlog is i think you mentioned historic levels but im just trying to understand how much like whats the multiple of the prior peak that your backlogs running at right now stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc betsy i would say that id have to go back and look at where the sort of prior record was set but its certainly at a record ill give you a little bit of composition in it which is that its cutting across a range of businesses were seeing higherthannormal replenishment and backlog build in emea and in asia than we are in the americas the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 but bear in mind overall size of the business in the americas is quite significant so notional dollars would be higher there but its showing some geographic composition to my memory i wouldnt view it as a multiple to prior peak i would call it as probably higher than where the top of that number had been historically betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then separately stephen i think you mentioned a comment about the dividend and you would look to raise that as soon as you could could you give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the sizing of that is typically people look at the dividend payout ratio relative to estimated forward earnings im guessing thats the metric that youre thinking about but maybe you can give us some color because of the revenue volatility that you have some pieces lower some pieces higher maybe give us a sense as to what we should be keying in on when were thinking about where to take dividend in our estimates stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i dont want to peg the exact sort of aspiration of where well be and our ambition is to take the dividend up when the rules permit but i would say that our ambition is to put the dividend in a more competitive standing than perhaps where it has sat historically by the way weve already been on that path having raised the dividend quite considerably since david and john and i all took our seats and so to my memory we took it up about or thereabout at the beginning of our tenure and higher since i think that the ambition here is to have the dividend grow commensurate with an increasing durability of revenues in the business as the more durable businesses or revenue streams and businesses grow the dividend ought to reflect that and it will and so thats probably the best sort of forward view on dividend thinking that i can provide operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you just give more color on it looks like market share gains but maybe by different category so one category would be size of client i know you have this middle market expansion effort was that a record and how is that doing a second category could be kind of corporate versus others a couple of years ago you were behind with the corporates you were trying to catch up and a third category would be geographic you mentioned emea and asia on a goforward basis but just as we look at the first quarter stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc so we dont break down the backlog exactly that way but let me just provide as much color as i can on this first of all in the middle market that continues to grow and the revenue that weve taken in in investment banking the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 around the growth in the client set has been quite substantial and frankly i think beyond that which we otherwise thought we would achieve at the investor day on the corporate side you can see it play out in the context of investment banking revenues broadly i would say equally were playing to a larger corporate set in our global market segment in terms of those becoming more prolific clients in what we do and then on the geography as i mentioned before we have seen kind of doubledigit growth in backlog in emea and in asia and we continue to see growth in the americas as well but again the americas presents a much larger set more broadly id also refer you back to a comment david made and weve spoken about before which is our ambition and our focus around client centricity in global markets its always been there as it relates to investment banking has put us in among the top three among of the most prolific clients top clients in global markets and thats up from the year before and so we continue to see growth in the share were taking by the way this is all against the backdrop of consolidation in share i would say among us banks relative to the european competitors across a range of product areas in equities and in ficc mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and you mentioned record prime balances so after the recent hedge fund incident do you see some players retreating and there youd have a flighttoquality effect with players coming to you or is something else taking place stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc i mean i think its too early to judge whether therell be a significant shift i suspect that therell be certain clients that look to migrate from where they were to a different firm but its too early to judge that i think the important thing to note is that growth in prime has been a strategic imperative for us its not the byproduct of the archegos incident or the like and as we grow that and this is what david was referring to we continue to maintain quite a vigilant posture as it relates to risk thats embedded in it we recognize risk of concentration we recognize the consumptive nature of that business and so were going to maintain kind of our threshold of risk tolerance in terms of clients that we bring on whether or not it shows consolidation in prime pricing pressure in prime i suspect it might but its just too early to judge that just yet operator your next question comes from the line of kian abouhossein with jpmorgan kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yes hi first of all thanks to heather for all her support i have two questions the first one relates to global markets you clearly indicated that this has been fueled by the very strong liquidity macro environment that weve seen and clearly all sublines have performed extremely well both last year and the first quarter and i wanted to understand how you make decisions about spending additional dollars in terms of investments structurally in these businesses considering everything is performing extremely well and most likely is asking for budget so if you can just talk about the business lines that youre investing as well as the geography stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well the one that i would call out is credit in ficc just as an example and i mentioned it earlier so this is where we saw a trend line developing around portfolio trading and so investments that we were making in platforms in technology capabilities and the like have served us well in the capture of a solid percentage of the portfolio trading the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 and the volumes that are going through there and so thats an example of advancing and enhancing our technology capabilities that are in place id also point out more generally that over the last couple of years weve been spending quite a bit of money on straightthrough processing that is taking note of the demands among our clients around middle and back office and the overall experience of our clients set not just on the front end of the trade but all through to the back each of those investments whether its technology to build platforms that captures portfolio trading credit or development of enhanced technology to automate and streamline the overall straightthrough processing all of that is subject to an roi framework with an eye toward improving the overall client and user experience thats there and so thats just a little bit of insight into how we think about the investment and where weve been making that investment kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc and my second question is coming back to technology stephen you also mentioned in your remarks clearly the focus on technology platforms and the front office experience for clients that you have improved and are improving but maybe you could elaborate a little bit more in detail for example how much of your business is cloudbased how much do you want to get to cloud how many platforms do you have on the trading side and how many do you envision to have in the future and on the front office side we hear from a lot of banks that theyre very good at the new platform operations that they are dealing with but just wondering what is the experience at goldman that makes it so different in your view stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well im not sure i have it at my hand the number of systems and the like but let me answer the question this way and let me use transaction banking as being a really good example okay transaction banking is a new platform designed from the frontend all the way through to the back into the books and records of the firm it is cloudbased engineering which has all the efficiencies that im sure youre aware of in terms of a lower expense to sort of keep it current in terms of developments around engineering and the like and so our new builds are largely perhaps not exclusively but largely cloudbased were always looking to rationalize platforms and i would say one thing ive learned from marco atte and george in engineering is that its as important to decommission old platforms as it is to put new ones in were riveted and focused on doing that so as to eliminate legacy technology build in the cloud and i think some of the newer businesses that were involved in transaction banking consumer benefit from the absence of legacy so that we can build new and efficiently and in the right form operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question just curious you guys are building out marcus as a big strategic priority you you rolled out the marcus invest weve got check writing coming when we look at some of the fintech platforms and what theyve embraced recently theres been a lot of excitement around offering crypto the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 you made a few comments on crypto and the outlook for how to engage in crypto in your institutional business but are you also considering including the offering of crypto wallets and whatnot on the consumer front where it seems as though there might be but certainly competitors have found an ability to offer that capability which has driven a lot of excitement and a lot of growth david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i appreciate the question brennan and at a high level obviously were monitoring this all very quickly we have a plan at the moment to build a digital bank thats offering an array of integrated basic services in a completely digital frictionless platform and were extremely focused on that at the moment we are not focused on offering a crypto wallet ahead of providing what ill call more basic set of financial services on a digital platform well obviously monitor how the world evolves with this well see how things progress and well continue to watch it but im not going to comment further on longer term plans for individuals weve been focused on other things and with respect to crypto payment systems the digitization of money weve been much more focused on the institutional side brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats fair thanks walk before you run maybe a little different than some of the fintech competitors anyway lets see broadening it out a little bit and thinking about your strategic targets and the new directions that youre going stephen you often flag the components and how much of the revenue is recurring which its probably underappreciated have you considered you guys have done a lot with disclosure and its been great and very constructive have you considered making some adjustments in the disclosures which would help investors and analysts to model some of those recurring revenues and show them as more mechanical so to speak for example with consumer banking i mean consumer banking is the one that seems most clear to me you just provide the revenue line but we dont know what the breakdown is in fees versus nii we dont know what the direct balances are tied to that we dont know credit metrics that would allow for some sort of more mechanical calculations and i think might assist in the appreciation of how much of your revenue base is actually recurring amongst the analysts and investor community have you considered any of those changes or shifts and do you think that might help in greater appreciation of those recurring revenue streams stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc so brennan first of all thanks for the feedback i mean its a big area of focus for us the strategy has clearly been to develop out businesses that exhibit greater durability to the revenue stream and theres no question that disclosure will follow in the context of providing all of you with greater insight into where we think or where we would define recurring and durability of earnings that are there on the specific points you raised around consumer i think as consumer grows and so david was reflecting before that that business is now turning a corner to sort of resemble the ambition of a broader platform than it is a series of products wed like to find ourselves in a place where we will and can provide greater disclosure on consumer just as an example the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 i would say the same will be true as transaction banking becomes more durable these are areas where as they become more material and we expect that they will disclosure will naturally follow and then i think your feedback is a good one just in the context of providing a firmwide perspective through disclosure on durability operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thanks so much good morning david and stephen a question here just on kind of the ma environment obviously a lot of activity going on in financials and fintech right now so love to maybe just get some perspective on what you guys are seeing within goldman specifically in terms of opportunities and what the appetite is and also whether anything has changed clearly the stock is at kind of a new level here its up yeartodate still only maybe times earnings but were at levels that you havent been at so just love to maybe get some context on the backdrop overall and then maybe how the appetite might be evolving david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc appreciate the question devin on the backdrop overall i assume by the backdrop overall youre just talking about broad ma activity theres been a meaningful pickup as confidence in the forward has increased and the comments that stephen made about backlog broadly and the constructive nature of this environment is obviously leading to clients being extremely engaged around strategic objectives that allow them to drive their businesses forward and really in all businesses everywhere we continue to see consolidation of those in a strong with consolidation by those that are in a strong position because all businesses continue in the digital world were in with further digitization require more tech investment more scale more global and so in that context obviously leaders are continuing to consolidate their strong positions with respect to our space broadly and how we think about this im going to repeat verbatim what i said last quarter and what ive said before we spend a lot of time looking at opportunities to accelerate the growth of our franchise in particular as we look at businesses like asset management and wealth if we could find something that we felt would accelerate our strategic growth objectives we would certainly consider it but the bar for anything significant is high and it has to be the right industrial logic more than the fact that we have a currency because the stocks higher and so we continue to think about ways that we could accelerate our growth but the bar to do it is high prices are high its a competitive environment and we feel good about our plan but well continue to do the work and be diligent about looking for opportunities where we can accelerate the growth of the firm devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific and then just a followup here weve received some investor questions just over some of the recent press reports around some management movement or departures even in some of the newer businesses and i think the question is more clearly goldman has a deep bench and is a large organization so sometimes i think the context gets lost but the question is more around whether theres any implication of a strategy evolution or shifts from at least what some of the press is picking up love to just get a comment if you can on that the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure we feel very very good about our team thats in place we have a very very deep bench and i think were in a great position with the leaders that are in place one of the things i just observed broadly and its consistent with our performance its consistent with stock market values and prices its consistent with the environment that were in there is a lot of activity in the world theres a lot of liquidity in the world and the world is very very competitive for great talent weve always been a developer of strong talent and weve always been a place where people come to look for great talent theres nothing about any of the attrition this year that looks extraordinary when you look back over a multiyear basis and i think were very wellpositioned but there are a lot of opportunities out there and at times as i said in my script people will go choose other things because they have bigger opportunities and we welcome that often they become clients when they make these moves we rarely lose people to competitors so i feel good about where we sit from a talent perspective i feel good about the interest that were finding people have and coming to be a part of goldman sachs and join the journey that were on to continue to grow the firm operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning david good morning stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hey gerard david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys give us a little more color i think you touched on when youre permitted to increase the dividend which i would assume would be third quarter when we go to the stress capital buffer construct that that might be an opportunity for the board to take up a dividend increase but in terms of just with your cet1 ratio i believe at investor day i think you guys said the mediumterm target was to could you share with us how you expect to manage to that number with share repurchases once we get into the stress capital buffer construct stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well i think the way to think about it is that share repurchase is going to follow kind of a longstanding philosophy where we look at opportunities across the firm to deploy capital and where those returns are attractive as they have been this past quarter well continue to do that where we dont we will look to return capital back in the form of share repurchase with the dividend obviously being a reflection as i commented earlier of greater the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 confidence and a more durable set of revenues and that ph and that dividend to increase to reflect it on the achievement of the to i would say that the lever is honestly less about share repurchase and more about what were doing to alter the capital consumptive density of the firm so key among those initiatives sits in asset management where the pivot from onbalance sheet to thirdparty fund is as much about creating a durable more predictable revenue stream as it is lowering the capital density of that business and therefore of the firm and to the extent that happens we will be doing ourselves the favor of reducing capital intensity but my expectation is that the fed will recognize it equally and subsequent ccar exams will reflect it as lowering of the requirement that we ultimately will have and its on top of that that well maintain what i view we view as an offensive buffer to deploy capital for clients so less about share repurchase more about fundamental shifts in change that were bringing to the business both to help ourselves and frankly speaking to enable the fed to come to a realization of the lower capital consumption profile of the business gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and then the followup the outlook that you guys have described is quite positive the federal reserve has pointed out theres going to be strong growth this year for this economy and the global economy as well as we all are expecting aside from the pandemic taking a reversal and it sets us all back and aside from a recession what and i know david you already touched on inflation as being a risk what are some of the risks that you keep your eyes on that could kind of set the outlook back maybe not as robust as it appears to be for you and some of your peers today david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well theres risk in markets constantly and part of markets and economic growth is rooted to confidence and things can go wrong at any time and things tend to pop up in places that you dont see or you dont expect i think we have a very very constructive environment gerard given that the world is dominated by the pandemic and dominated by the actions that central banks and governments are taking to respond to the pandemic the weightiness of that the heft of that really overshadows most else thats going on i do think over time well be having discussions about the increase in government debt government spending around the world there will be consequence to that that can obviously have an impact over time theres a general view at the moment that rates are going to be low for very very long certainly given some of the actions that are taken you could see a scenario where the perspective on that would change and could change quickly and that would certainly create headwinds to growth and headwinds to activity but i do think we have a very very good backdrop at the moment with a higher probability or distribution of strong economic growth because we had such a sharp reaction to the other side given the pandemic and the unwind of that i think will dominate as we move through the rest of the year into next year operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks i had a question on the prime book i know it says that youre at the records in the first quarter of this year but is there a way to frame like the overall exposure from prime kind of like what the balance sheet exposure is what the market shares are from that business stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well kind of hard to put precision around that i would simply say that weve made it as ive said a strategic priority to grow prime balances i would say that our business has skewed historically more to the longshort and less so competitively relative to the comp to the quants but our ambition is to continue to grow it but as i said before that growth is not going to happen absent corresponding risk insight into how that book grows were very very aware of the embedded risk in it were very aware of the liquidity consumption in that book and so we mind ourselves as we grow volumes in that but its been part and parcel again to this theme of durability around financing that goes on in and around that business and so the balances have grown consistent with that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc and the only other comment id make brian around the business is that there is a clear consolidation going on with the leaders because of scale because of technology capability and i think were well positioned for that trend if that trend continues going forward brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and maybe another look at the prime business though is there any way to frame kind of where leverage is on the underlying client level today versus where it was precovid i mean are we seeing a lot of massive increase in leverage versus where we were before thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well i would say i mean listen it depends a lot on the collateral pool that you have let me describe it this way its hard for us to know what goes on in every other bank around the street i can only speak to what we know and watch inside of goldman sachs and so what david was describing particularly around archegos the story is less about the events of archegos as much as how were set up to monitor it and so we look at consolidated or overly consolidated concentrated positions in individual accounts we look for excessive position concentration across the whole of our business we look and undertake a daily mark to market on collateral and corresponding margin and in tracking concentration and correlation we adjust what it is that were doing the level of margin we take the clients we take in the pricing we put against that prime those are all the important inputs in terms of how we grow that business broadly operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 hey good morning maybe just talking a little bit about the implications of the explosive growth in the spac market you guys have had pretty good market share there i guess number one do you think theres clearly a lot of pentup demand for ma that has to get done in the next months does that make you even more excited about the ma prospects for you and the industry and should we see a subsequent sort of cooling off in the underwriting side just because the demand the amount of capitalchasing deals seems very high david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so a couple of comments at a high level i mean theres no question that given the number of spacs that have been raised the incentives that are set certainly lead to all those sponsors to look for deals actively and given our position in the ma market that should be a tailwind that said just to quantify it when you look at our ma activity that ma activity for us with spacs last quarter i think was a singledigit percentage of the ma activity that we participated in so while its a tailwind i wouldnt say that thats dominating the ma activity and the positive constructive comments we made around ma in fact thats really rooted in much more broad strategic activity that weve seen a big pickup in over the course of the last six to nine months with respect to underwriting activity theres no question that it has slowed from the peak of where it was i think theres a little indigestion in the context of that youve obviously seen returns in some of the shells kind of slowed at this point id also highlight just again kind of backlog that when you look at ecm revenue last quarter spacs were less than of our ecm revenue last quarter so this all creates a tailwind but my guess is in this quarter youll see less new issuance than what we saw in the first quarter and youll see a continued progress of people trying to find ma targets to destack all of that should be constructive for our business james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc and as a followup do you see any sort of longerterm good or bad with you noted that its an innovation thats probably here to stay do you see it a net positive for the investment banking industry or just its another quiver in for financing david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think its another form of capital formation and financing but what i tried to highlight in my remarks jim is that i think its going to continue to evolve i think theres room for improvement in disclosures and youll see us continue to push to improve disclosures i think youll see different structures around incentive alignment for sponsors and i think youll see an evolution in that so like any other innovation they evolve they mature but i do think capital formation that leads to more liquidity in markets and more opportunities for investors to participate is generally a good thing but how its done the disclosure around it the incentives the transparency all those things are things where i think theres room for progress around this innovation operator your next question comes from the line of jeremy sigee with exane jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom morning thank you i just wanted to go back to the archegos comments you were making earlier on and what it means for the prime brokerage business more broadly and i just wondered if you could comment on how unusual archegos was compared to other funds that you do business with in prime brokerage in terms of their the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2021 leverage or their investment position so was this an ordinary situation like multiple others that you do business with that just went wrong or was this some kind of real outlier to start with david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc at a high level at a high level jeremy its hard to make generalizations around these things but i think what was unusual here was for a variety of reasons this particular fund wound up with very concentrated positions very quickly and i think that was unusual and then the actions that they chose to take or chose not to take obviously affected the outcome but i think it was unusual with respect to the size and the concentration of positions which changed relatively quickly jeremy sigee q analyst exane sa united kingdom and just to follow up do you expect any change in how you do business as a result of this incident or how the industry does business either in terms of risk limits margin levels capital requirements either that you determine or that maybe the regulators are going to determine for this business david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think we always look at every experience we have on a daytoday basis and we always try to learn and we always adjust and theres no question that we spent a lot of time looking at this even though i feel that we executed very well here we got this one right we dont always get everything right so we always look at every situation to try to tweak and improve our risk management processes and how we think about these things i do think that there given the visibility of this i do think therell be regulatory discussion around it as i said in my prepared remarks well participate constructively in those discussions but i think its too early to speculate one way or another whether it will have any impact i do think to some degree this was a oneoff event but as i said earlier we will see from time to time people get overly concentrated they have too much leverage and that leads to unwinds stephen m scherr chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc okay so operator at this time stephen m scherr chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sorry go ahead well since there are no more questions id like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months if additional questions arise in the meantime please dont hesitate to reach out to carey and the ir team otherwise please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on
