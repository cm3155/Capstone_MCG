morning everybody im joining you today from california where we have been hosting one of our bestknown client events the builders innovators summit we bring together over of the most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build successful and enduring companies ive heard from a number of them that theyre extremely excited to meet with our team and with other entrepreneurs here in california in addition over the last few months ive also been able to travel around to spend time with our employees and clients in person which has been invigorating in my conversations with clients and in the results were reporting today its clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing this quarter we announced two acquisitions a key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our investor day in centered around diversifying our business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings theres no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans and now we are further investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution first in august we announced the acquisition of a leading european asset manager nn investment partners the addition of billion in assets under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our asset management platform enhance our distribution network on the continent and bolster our esg capabilities on the topic of esg as world leaders prepare to convene in glasgow later this month for cop26 i would like to underscore the firms commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the paris agreement this includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth and were making progress toward our target of billion in sustainable financing investing and advisory activity to help achieve these goals the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 my view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more sustainable future this includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon this transition is complex and wont happen overnight it will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part and given that fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future it is critical that we strike a balance between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face our second acquisition was greensky which we announced in september this transaction furthers our efforts to build the consumer banking platform of the future it provides our consumer business with an attractive and high credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over merchants and a secularly growing market it adds a digital cloudbased infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform and with the addition of our bank funding model we expect to generate 20plus returns at scale through recurring feebased and net interest income revenues importantly these customers will be our customers that will live in the markets ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives turning to page of our presentation we produced net revenues of billion driven by yearonyear increases in three of our four business segments on the bottom line we delivered net earnings of billion and quarterly earnings per share of our yeartodate revenues of nearly billion and net earnings of over billion are higher than any full year results in our history and drove an roe of nearly and an rote of over our performance underscores the strength of our client

ma franchise driving strategic activity and associated financing to elevated levels we delivered solid results in global markets as we continue to focus on market share and engage with clients on a broader array of solutions in asset management assets under supervision hit another record of trillion which will be further enhanced by the nnip acquisition we continue to transition our alternatives business to more thirdparty funds and we have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients raising billion against our goal of billion in gross fundraising commitments since our investor day and in consumerwealth management we had a record quarter in wealth management weve seen strong long term feebased inflows in the first nine months of the year and had big client wins in ayco that give us the opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations in consumer we are now enabling million customers to spend borrow and save on a multiproduct platform all in our strong performance tireless focus on our clients and relentless execution of our strategy strengthen my confidence that we will continue to advance our strategic evolution and deliver higher more durable returns for our shareholders let me now turn to page broadly speaking the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals but there is increasing uncertainty behind a number of factors on the one hand fiscal and monetary policy remain accommodative and equity markets are still near alltime highs covid19 vaccination rates are rising around the world i believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemics effects on the global economy and as technology behind the vaccines continues to improve we will make further progress against the virus that being said there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty were paying close attention to first the trajectory of inflation particularly wage inflation in the short term second there remains significant uncertainty the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 around the delta variant third theres ongoing political debate in the us over economic policy including the potential for additional infrastructure deals the longerterm extension of the federal debt ceiling and tax increases and fourth the uschina relationship remains complicated taken together these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth as further indicated by the downward revision in our economists us gdp expectations earlier this week regardless of the market backdrop i consistently hear from clients how much they value the highquality service we provide especially our differentiated advice and execution capabilities as i look ahead i remain optimistic about the opportunity set for goldman sachs and our ability to grow our firm activity levels remain high particularly in investment banking and we have solid momentum in our asset management client business before i close i would like to thank stephen for his nearly three decades of service to the firm ive had the privilege to work with stephen since the early and i couldnt be more grateful for his counsel and friendship over the last years in january as we announced previously stephen will be succeeded by denis coleman a 25year veteran of goldman sachs who has held numerous leadership positions within investment banking most recently as cohead of the financing group he and stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for almost years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the cfo seat with that ill turn it over to stephen stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning to all of you on the call before i turn to the results let me say briefly that i have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you our shareholders and the analyst community over the past three years as cfo and i am committed to facilitating a smooth handoff to denis who as carey noted has joined us on the call today on our results let me begin with our business performance by segment starting on page im pleased to start with investment banking which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its secondhighest quarterly net revenues of billion the consistency of performance in investment banking is a reflection of both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive position financial advisory revenues of billion were an alltime high we maintained our number one league table position for the yeartodate participating in trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of ma activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups with particular strength in tmt and healthcare and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market underwriting results were strong notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the first half equity underwriting generated billion in revenues representing our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of billion we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the yeartodate with volumes in excess of billion across deals that represents volume market share of in debt underwriting net revenues were million with performance supported by solid highyield and investmentgrade issuance as well as acquisition financing activity given the current levels of ma announcements and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors we expect acquisition financing activity the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 to remain high despite significant levels of completed transactions our investment banking backlog nonetheless ended the quarter significantly higher than yearend levels corporate lending results of million reflected revenues from transaction banking middlemarket lending and the relationship loan book including associated hedges in transaction banking we achieved our fiveyear goal of billion in deposits this quarter well ahead of the target date as a key growth initiative for the firm with a very large addressable market we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding customers and driving higher engagement on the platform which has exceeded expectations we remain confident in the longerterm revenue target for this business of billion moving to global markets on page segment net revenues were billion in the quarter higher yearon year driven by healthy client activity notably in equities and a generally supportive marketmaking environment characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas results were also supported by recent market share gains across ficc and equities global markets again produced returns in excess of the target roe expressed at our investor day reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost turning to page our ficc businesses generated billion of net revenues for the third quarter the decline in ficc intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates credit and mortgages offset by materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies activity increased into the end of the quarter with september proving to be a very strong month our commodities business continued to perform well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business including in oil natural gas and power ficc financing revenues of million were the best in over a decade and were up meaningfully driven by mortgage lending consistent with our strategy total equities revenues of billion were very strong helped by higher results in equities intermediation amid better performance in both derivatives and cash and record equities financing as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients moving to asset management on page in the third quarter we generated revenues of billion management and other fees totaled million which were impacted by approximately million of fee waivers on our money market funds we again extended these waivers for clients consistent with industry practice in this low rate environment equity investments produced net revenues of million amid billion of gains on our billion private investment portfolio plus our consolidated investment entities partially offset by million in losses on our billion public portfolio losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions which by contrast were material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter additionally we had operating revenues of roughly million related to our cie portfolio staying with asset management page again provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt positions by vintage region and where relevant accounting treatment on page we show a longer time series of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our onbalance sheet investments since our investor day we have actively harvested positions of billion which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of billion and additions of billion which include early fund facilitation and other commitments the implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our investor day is approximately billion we continue to have line of sight on billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to billion of capital reduction we remain focused on the execution of this the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment to this end we sold over billion of cie portfolio during the quarter and also disposed of billion of private positions moving to page consumer wealth management produced record revenues of billion in the third quarter in wealth management very strong longterm feebased inflows for the yeartodate helped drive record management and other fees of billion which rose versus the second quarter and yearonyear incentive fees of million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds private banking and lending revenues of million rose with loans to private wealth clients up billion sequentially as demand for lending products remains high amid the lowrate environment i would add that we view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering with room for further growth based on the needs of our clients and our current penetration rates as well as the strong credit standing of this client base consumer banking revenues were million in the quarter reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit balances yearoveryear we expect loan growth to accelerate in given the pending acquisitions of greensky and the general motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product set looking across these two segments page shows our firmwide assets under supervision and management and other fees weve been building these businesses steadily and total aus now stands at a record trillion putting us in the top five of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally this growth has driven higher firmwide management and other fees which rose yearoveryear to a record billion on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion for the third quarter higher versus a year ago reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interestearning assets our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion up billion sequentially reflecting increases across the portfolio corresponding provision for credit losses of million reflected portfolio growth on page you see our total quarterly operating expenses of billion our efficiency ratio for the yeartodate stands at reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a payforperformance culture and investing for growth our yeartodate noncompensation expenses were down but up ex litigation while our compensation expenses were up on a yeartodate basis turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach down basis points sequentially despite higher capital on solid earnings generation the decline was driven largely by a billion increase in rwas partially reflecting revisions to rwa calculations based on regulatory feedback in the quarter in the quarter we returned a total of billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion and million in common stock dividends consistent with our capital management philosophy we will prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns and then return any excess to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases in conclusion we delivered another quarter of strong performance reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise additionally we announced two acquisitions that will enhance both our asset management and consumer businesses and increase the firms recurring revenue stream looking forward the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm as we continue to execute on our strategy we are building towards a path to sustainable midteens returns the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you stephen i wonder if i could ask a quick followup question on your comments just now on capital so you make a ton of money book is up yearonyear amazing you did the greensky and nnip deals but rwa was up because activity was strong and saccr is coming so i wonder if you could just peel back the onion a little bit more and just talk about where you see your excess position now and if at the margin we should be expecting continued investment in say the digital consumer build at the margin more so than the buyback side thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure glenn so let me start kind of with a reiteration of our standing capital policy as you know our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that especially when returns are as attractive as they have been so in a quarter where we produce roe it stood to reason and consistent with that that we deploy the capital in the business id also point out that in the dividend our dividend is now at a share up from so on an annual basis were returning an additional billion or so to shareholders through the dividend and where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive well return capital back and that really represents what we do in terms of share repurchase now in terms of the opportunity set you referred into the consumer business its unquestionably a priority david has reflected time and again the longterm view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to the firm but i would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity it is a broad look across the firm and we think always about how do we add in an agile way deployed capital across the whole of the business so i wouldnt necessarily say that its targeted against any one in particular obviously were operating at a higher scb a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the fed therefore surplus is less and we and consistent with the policy always look forward to what will be in effect a petition on capital that we know saccr is certainly one of them and in that regard while weve not made a formal decision on implementation and well let our regulators know when we do were looking forward to that and our view is that when we put saccr in place it will increase our rwas by about billion or tax our ratio by about basis points it is at that level in part because as we look back when saccr was finalized by basel in and then adopted by the fed in and we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect so the implementation now reflects mitigation progress weve made in anticipation of it as opposed to kind of a starting workstream and obviously the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuant to the rules could play out but i think thats a reflection of a proactive engagement so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio now relative to what it would have been and so sorry for the long answer but that gives you kind of a complete picture if you will of how were thinking about capital the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi that was comprehensive i appreciate it take no offense look one last followup because yeartodate revenues are up and so strong you made a ton of money comp dollars accrued are up i wonder if we could talk about that a little bit in terms of comp leverage i know its a bottomup and i know a lot of people at goldman sachs are killing it this year but i think 1mdb impacted things last year so just thinking full yeartofull year comp ratio anything on the puts and takes on what to expect stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so maybe i start with the numbers and then ill turn it to david who i think can reflect on kind of comp philosophy generally but where we are right now comp to net revenue net of provision for credit loss is at through nine months that was at when we ended the second quarter we always reserve for compensation consistent with whats required of us which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance as at that date obviously theres a quarter to go so were at a ratio revenue net of provision for credit loss you can see through nine months in the comp and benefits line not to confuse the two numbers that number is up again reflecting the performance of the business and a payforperformance philosophy more broadly that is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up yeartodate and revenues net of provisions up so you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we believe to be a healthy and robust comp process i think overall if you look at total operating expenses because we look at it that way including our noncomp expense there continues to be the exhibition of leverage operating leverage in the business again revenues up but total operating expenses exlitigation are up and so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically but maybe david wants to comment just on the philosophy david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc glenn i appreciate the question i know one of the things youre getting at theres no question theres comp pressure theres wage inflation everywhere at all aspects of every business right now were extremely focused on it we are a payforperformance culture and theres no question that people are performing but were very very comfortable that were managing this in a way where we can show real operating leverage to our shareholders given our performance and at the same time pay our people exceptionally for the exceptional performance and were on top of it and we feel good about it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you both appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 good morning david and stephen and then welcome denis firstly just echo davids sentiment about stephen congratulations and definitely will be very big shoes to fill for sure so my first question here is on the digital consumer bank that business continues to do very well yeartodate revenue growth is an impressive but that still lags some of the pureplay neobanks out there and some of that might just be a function of product holes i think a check in payment functions and investment functions and marcus a little bit light so curious here how you think about the product roadmap from here for marcus the potential to use ma to fill some of those product gaps and then longer term how should we think about sort of sustainable revenue growth for that business david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure ill start and stephen may add some comments but this is christian this is something that were focused on over the long term i think weve built an excellent platform from a standing start of zero in five years weve built a very very significant depository institution with over billion of digital deposits no branches very small marketing budget or customer acquisition costs the cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very very efficient visàvis other models we have million customers that were servicing right now we have our own credit card platform that i think is really differentiated and were onboarding both other partnerships but also have the opportunity for a proprietary card thats in development weve talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during and that is on track and its expanding greensky allows us to broadly expand our pointofsale capability and as was highlighted in the starting comments their tech platform their cloudbased technology integrates very seamlessly into what were doing and so we feel very good about the fact that were going to continue to grow this and build a consequential business we have a longterm view with it im not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to look at a revenue growth model were looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable recurring net earnings to goldman sachs over time and to compound that and we do believe that if we serve clients well in a seamless way with good technology it will continue to grow and we will do that i dont know stephen if you have anything else you think should be added stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well the only thing id add christian is if you just look at the yearoveryear comparison right so you cant forget that we went through kind of a more challenging period in covid where we by design looked to limit the amount of underwriting we were doing were now coming back to sort of turn that back on having seen the portfolio perform very well so yearoveryear revenues in consumer are up in the deposit line theyre up in credit cards and thats just a reflection of the renewed commitment that david is reflecting to sort of growing out that business and seeing it perform and i think davids comments are spot on if you look at loans and savings and apple card soon to be joined by general motors the investing module and checking this is whats coming into focus is a big broad platform that can serve customers in all of their needs as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set and i think were at a key moment now with the acquisition of greensky to sort of take that forward the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 christian bolu q analyst autonomous research great thank you my second question maybe is on back to trading a bit of a highclass problem here but the results is just another quarter of market share gains in the trading businesses but the share gains have been so dramatic over the last few years that one has to wonder how sticky it could be going forward so just curious how you think about sustainability of share gains in the trading business as we roll into sort of and david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well christian i appreciate your focus on the share gains i dont i think its a really important part and highlight of what weve been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out going back to investor day and so i think there are a couple of things that weve tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the position of this business and i think that were accruing results that will be quite sticky and i dont want to say that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they wont we know that but we positioned the business much much better for i think two principal reasons number one the business has been much more focused on having a clientcentric one gs culture to really figure out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way the business has been less transactional more longtermfocused on the client relationship and the level of client service while bringing to bear the market making provisioning and financing capabilities of the firm that we have and im hearing repeatedly from clients that they see a real switch in the way were operating the business and its accruing to market share gains its benefiting us in that context number two we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we could meaningfully grow and target and so since the investor day we targeted our ability to grow our financing capability across both equities and ficc and we succeeded on that and thats a place where weve taken market share and that is more durable share obviously and we continue to think there are opportunities that we can continue to prosecute on the financing side and thats different i would also highlight that weve been making significant investments in technology and we have the scale and have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients and i think one of the things thats happening broadly is the leading players here given the tech necessity have an advantage to secondary or tertiary players and so were benefiting from that also now theres no question this is a very conducive environment the performance of that business and were not sitting here saying this level of performance will continue but i think that the way were running the business the focus weve made certainly takes us a stepfunction up from where we were in id also say as part of our investor day we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business and so even if we went back to a different level were at a higher hurdlereturn rate and the business at lower levels and so we feel very good about the way the business is positioned operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question its nearly a multifaceted one on just sponsors in the alternative space sponsors have been really a significant and clearly growing contributor to increased ma activity these last months you guys have certainly benefited from that but as someone with unique perspective into the business just given youre building out your own third party alternatives platform and you cited some really impressive fundraising numbers i was hoping you could just speak to how much longer this frenzied pace of both fundraising and deal activity could persist and whether there are any factors we should be watching whether its tax reform or higher rates that could potentially derail some of that momentum david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure and ill try to talk at a high level about some of this steve and i think youre right were at a moment in time where the activity levels are quite high first on fundraising id just say that one of the reasons why we got very focused a few years ago in a much more organized way growing our third party capital and building institutional relationships to add to our alternatives platform is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital allocation into alternatives and as you get out and you get around the world whether its governments and sovereign wealth funds of broad institutions all of them or a broad array of them are increasing their allocation to alternatives i think in addition theres no question that were in a position the world is in a position where retail participation through wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space and so theres more access being offered to wealthy individuals weve always had a distribution channel with ultrawealthy individuals but that access is broadening more significantly and so i do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad global alternatives platforms i think were very well positioned for that and so thats helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted with respect to deal activity theres a lot of dry powder out there i would note that sponsor activity in ma was a much higher percentage of activity this quarter than its been over the last few years and in the past when sponsor activity has increased it runs for a while but then ultimately therell be something that backs it off were watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully thinking very carefully about risk management around that it feels at the moment given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the re acceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic that this will run for some while but thats also something that were going to watch very carefully because it wont sustain at this pace therell certainly be speed bumps along the way the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks david for all of that color and maybe just for my followup a question stephen just on equity investment and the impact to capital one of the primary drivers of future scb reduction which youve talked about is the harvesting of those equity investments we know they get very punitive treatment in ccar and this is a highclass problem shrinking the investments at least on a net basis has proven rather difficult and remains stubbornly above that billion level how much smaller does the book need to get in order to meaningfully reduce your scb and is that to cet1 target still the appropriate longterm bogey just given some of the stubbornly high equity investments that have persisted for the better part of a couple of years now stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure let me start with the end part of your question our stronglyheld view is that to is the right place for this firm to operate now our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the fed is otherwise requiring of us in the context of ccar and scb so in that context what we can do and what we are doing is candidly taking action into our own hands meaning were not waiting for petitions to be wellreceived in order that that requirement comes down but instead were pivoting and moving from balance sheet into fund format i think if you look at page in our deck what youll see is whats happened in terms of billion of dispositions and what that has meant for ae freeup so ill just give you a sense of it in the last nine months weve seen reduction in balance sheet of billion corresponding to billion of ae since investor day billion of reduction in balance sheet and billion of freed ae and we have line of sight from where we sit to about billion of balance sheet reduction freeing up about billion of ae i give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity thats been going on that will continue and we had always focused in on whether or not at investor day we would experience a bit of a canyon if you will of revenue meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace faster slope than what might have been a yawning line if you will to fundraising and deployment thats not happening as david has said we have billion of fundraising which and underlying that is about billion of aus which is feepaying and so that transition is being managed well and this just gives you a sense of the overall capital reduction in the context of what were trying to achieve operator your next question comes from the line of jeff harte with piper sandler jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey jeff david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 good morning jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co so balance sheet growth has stepped up since the pandemic and its something weve kind of been waiting for really kind of since the great financial crisis can you talk a bit about how much of that growth has really been driven by client demand for balance sheet which would be a good thing versus just being a function of kind of qe and the flood of liquidity in the market stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well i would say that much of the balance sheet growth that has gone on has been attributed to client activity if you just look at segmentbysegment you look at growth in our financing activity in investment banking that supports our ma franchise you look at financing thats going on in the context of both ficc and equities that were up yearonyear and that david was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability and the forward in our trading business and so a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients i would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet it doesnt grow in isolation meaning we have various risk metrics that are in place capital has obviously grown liquidity maintained at the firm obviously grows in the form of our gcla and so all of these i think are meant to be read in tandem in the context of serving clients but doing that in a way where balance sheet growth is held in the context of various risks be it capital and liquidity profile of the firm itself were not we are not a bank notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are experiencing the kind of outsized growth in deposits that youre seeing or that you have seen at the bigger commercial banks and that is inflating balance sheet there were not seeing that kind of inflation frankly in part because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very useable deposits as a substitute for wholesale funding jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay and as we think about the kind of recurring question for a number of quarters now capital markets and kind of how sustainable are these really strong activity levels understanding that you cant predict that things could shut off tomorrow how do you think about things like investment banking and global markets when you look at kind of the budgeting process into next year and maybe the year beyond i mean how do you approach that whats your outlook from that perspective david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think our outlook there are a confluence of things jeff that are going on that are obviously quite accommodative for this youre right at any point in time that mix could change and we wouldnt see the same robust amount of client activity but we have fundamental growth in markets we have fundamental growth in economic activity around the world and that over periods of time grows longterm growth in these business platforms so i certainly would say were running at very very robust capital markets activity in the investment banking franchise at the moment but id also say whenever things slowdown or rebalance a little were going to find that the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 these businesses are baseline fundamentally larger than they were five years ago because the growth in market cap of the world and the growth in economic activity in the world and so weve always said that theres a real correlation to economic activity to our activity theres a real correlation in market cap growth to our activity obviously these things will ebb and flow but we have lots of flexibility in the context of the way we manage the businesses and these businesses i think will continue to be strong performers even in different environments they just might not perform at this level all the time operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey so we talked a little bit earlier about market share and market share opportunities i just wanted to take a slightly different angle on that and ask the question about where you think youre punching below your weight if we could think about that being an opportunity from a regional perspective so especially in europe or latin america maybe asia you could speak to where you think you have opportunities in those regions thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i mean id point to a couple things at a high level betsy theres no question one of the reasons why nn was really attractive to us is that in our asset management business weve been punching below our weight across europe both in terms of the assets that we were supervising but also in our distribution capabilities and nn accelerates that i still think theres more opportunity there i do think around some of the public portion of our gsam business across the world theres still opportunities for us to punch at a better weight even though at this point were one of the top five active asset managers and so we continue to think about that as an opportunity i think there are opportunities for us around the wealth management business in particular in europe and weve been focused on that i think there are wealth management opportunities for us in the us as we move from simply managing money with ultrahighnet worth clienteles that have been our traditional pwm business to a more massaffluent structure and using digital technology and expanding the use of ayco china is another place where theres opportunity for us from a wealth management perspective and youve seen weve announced our joint venture with icbc which we think is an interesting opportunity in that part of the world and so those are a handful of things from a regionalized basis i would highlight the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i was wondering if you could just kind of marktomark us on your tech successes or initiatives as you mentioned yeartodate growth in revenues is two to three times that of expenses so youre getting the higher marginal margin now some of thats due to the bull market you mentioned comp leverage but then how much of that is due to technology so i guess one way to phrase this question is by area so you have your new growth initiatives you mentioned digital deposits of billion transaction banking deposits of billion so that would i think thats borne in the cloud and then you have your legacy trading activities where i guess theres been a lot of electronification then theres the rest of the company where im not really sure what the tech backbone is so the question is how much has the tech backbone contributed to that higher marginal margin for each of the growth areas trading and the rest of the firm david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well ill start mike and stephen im sure will have some things to add here too at a high level were spending significantly on technology to expand the platforms that we operate on to better connect to our clients and to enable us obviously to operate more efficiently were performing very well at the moment but our commitment to continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the cloud for a variety of reasons which ill highlight in just a second i think is something that weve been very focused on strategically and it continues but were in the middle of the execution path historically developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build and host technology and cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly service our clients needs rather than doing what i call as undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech builds that managed what was more traditional tech infrastructure the cloud really provides lowfriction access to technologies such as big data machine learning analytics which enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 connect with us and its allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have and you highlighted some of them like transaction banking and some of the things were doing on the marcus platform and so theres no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that we know that the cloud is not for everything and so there were some services and ill give you an example like high frequency trading that are better served onpremise and so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment and we also choose our partners in kind of a multicloud or what we call a polycloud strategy so that we can take the bestofbreed offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do for our clients so overall were in this journey thats very very intentional its aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently and i think were getting real benefit from it in the execution of our strategy but i think theres more upside in that as we continue to build the financial cloud so to speak for some of our principal businesses i mean stephen would you add anything to that or do you want to quantify some things a little more stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah the only thing id add was a bit of quantification so mike if you heard me say before our noncomp expenses so excluding litigation just looking at the core noncomp expense yeartodate is up if you look at the gross expense that that represents about a third of that increase is related to technology so about a third of the increase of noncompensation expense in the firm through the first nine months relates to technology and this is spent all across the firm so its both in particular initiatives like consumer txb marquee but equally its spent broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm cloudbased engineering is one that david brought to your attention in all of these spends we sweat the roi of this investment and so as an example part of the uplift will enable us to create greater opportunity for automation which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm so id just offer that to you just to give you some sort of dimension if you will from a true expense line as to what david was otherwise describing mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just a followup maybe digging deeper on transaction banking ive been a little skeptical but you did get your fiveyear target as you said and so if you think about the cloud cloudenabled cloudnative or i think in that case born in the cloud can you just define really what that means is that the nirvana state of being in the cloud the way you have transaction banking and to what degree has that contributed to you getting your billion and by the way does that billion include any deposits from goldman sachs itself stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so i dont believe that there are gs deposits in it its billion of gross deposits and as weve said thats now become about operational so a value to us but just to come back to your question about the cloud so the txb business was built entirely in the cloud i dont know that i would necessarily conclude that that is why its been successful i would conclude however that it is how its been built on a very costefficient basis and built the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 with a level of security that i think satisfies us and our client base meaning i think its a draw card in the context of it the reason mike is kind of selfevident which is that its built in the cloud as david noted its not built with multiple instances of the transaction banking platform across redundant data centers it benefits without necessarily costing us to sort of improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like that is the benefit of sitting within the cloud itself so i cant tell you that i could draw a line to the deposits that have come in i can tell you that weve built it better cheaper and on a more attractive basis to facilitate client attention and attraction to it david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the one thing though the one thing mike that i want to add very very clearly the reason our transaction banking platform is i think accelerating in its success is because the quality of the offering for our clients is differentiated and better meeting their needs than the existing offerings and part of the reason as stephen highlighted we could do that so quickly was because its easier to build in the cloud and transition but fundamentally this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform that took friction out of an activity that was deeply embedded in our corporate clients as a user of that activity we saw that experience and we saw that there were ways that that experience could be improved and weve built a platform that delivers a better experience and thats why its succeeding thats why its meeting targets and continuing to grow and thats why were very optimistic stephen laid out to you billion of revenue were confident in that target and this business has margin in it and will be a good contributor and so were very confident about how well continue to execute but fundamentally its about the quality of the product were delivering to our clients operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions just first just congrats best of luck to you stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc and yeah and denis congrats to you also on the new role looking forward to working together maybe we could start with the greensky acquisition so the firm a lot of investors see how the stock has performed since the ipo pointed to a spotty history in underwriting and the firm began exploring strategic alternatives in august of so could you maybe add your perspective on why this was the right franchise to connect to your growing consumer banking business and maybe what you think the market might not be appreciating or understanding about this company that led you to be interested in acquiring it david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 sure i mean ill start here and appreciate the question brennan but first its a very different company its an independent public company than it is as a platform inside goldman sachs and one of the big weaknesses of the company as an independent public company is it didnt have a funding model and it had to fund differently inside goldman sachs where we have funding and attractive funding it becomes a technology platform that allows us to connect to a very attractive base of customers that we can pull into the markets ecosystem i think the merchant network that they developed with over merchants and they developed over years is extremely valuable and then the work we did to try to have a pointofsale merchant network and look at that we think it wouldve taken us close to years to develop a similar network and so the ability to acquire that network bring in very very highquality customers these are customers that own homes these are customers that have high fico scores very very attractive into goldman sachs it allowed us to do something that fits seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the pointofsale activities that we were doing and so we feel very very good about it and we think that this acquisition will consistently deliver 20plus returns on the activity that it generates brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that david maybe followingup on that could you provide some context around the strategic priorities from here youve done two recent acquisitions smaller bolton size but certainly a bit of activity when you think about the different businesses in which you want to grow youve done a lot of these smaller boltons some in the wealth side with united capital and folio several years ago and nn and greensky more recently going from here is there any particular business that you think is quite compelling given either some combination of ripe inorganic opportunities that the market might be underappreciating similar to or the platform can be different within goldman than it is as a standalone the way it was with greensky how should investors think about priorities and direction from here and how they stack david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure brennan ill bring you back i really want to bring you back and center you around what we said during our investor day we laid out a strategy that said we will continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market share and increase the positioning i think weve done that theres still some opportunities to continue to do that but we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position while also increasing the mix of durable feebased revenues into the business and when you look at those areas its transaction banking its asset management its wealth management and its our digital consumer bank and so as we look forward i still think there are opportunities to grow all four of those areas i think we can continue to grow them organically but when there are opportunities to make an acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas were going to take a hard look at it as ive said before the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high i think there is still opportunities and maybe opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas but we are focused on those four areas because those four areas diversify the durability of our revenues and allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream and so thats the frame that well continue to look at i wouldnt point to anything more specifically the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great thanks good morning i guess first question just want to dig in a little bit on asset management and the opportunity on the third party alternatives fundraising and just the ability to continue to scale that both on kind of the customer side and product side and when we look at some of the i guess standalone alternative manager peers theyve done a great job in recent years of expanding the product menu and then consolidating lp relationships where theyre connecting on numerous products and so that effectively creates a network effect and so looking at goldman where do you guys feel like you are with lps and is the opportunity to add more lps or theres a bigger opportunity to connect with more goldman sachs product and then i guess on the product side alternatives are there any areas where you feel like you could accelerate investment or those could be areas that could help you connect i guess with your lps existing lps on more products david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i appreciate the question devin its obviously something strategically weve been very focused on but ill go back to some of the things that we said at investor day that kind of geared us toward our focus on this weve been in these businesses for a long time and we actually have something that i think is very differentiated in that we have a truly broad global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years we have positions in private equity in growth equity in credit in real estate in infrastructure and we also have them globally around the world and when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms there are some that have that broad array but very few have all the products on a global basis the way were set up what was differentiated or different about our business in alternatives before we rolled it together and got it focused is generally our lp relationships came through our private wealth network and we raised an enormous amount of money through our private wealth network including the partners of the firm while we had some institutional lp relationships we had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform and given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities we knew that if we took a one gs approach at really taking a longterm view and building relationships with those institutional partners we could grow our partnership with them so a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new lps to our ecosystem and if you look at strategic solutions which we raised last year there were a number of probably a dozen new significant institutional lps that the first time they were coming onto our platform was in that strategic solutions fund so i think theres a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that its something were very focused on but the opportunity for us is less in product addition although we are adding products we just raised the horizon fund which is an esgcentered fund to allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies and well add other product capabilities that we think are interesting but our focus is on meaningfully using the goldman sachs platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand the list of institutional lps that are partnered with us and i think we have a lot of upside to run on that operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey thank you just one question david address to us how youre thinking about just digital assets as youre seeing the entire ecosystem being built around digital asset custody tokenization just give us a perspective because it feels like all of that would be right in goldmans wheelhouse to capitalize as some of these things accelerate so would love to hear your perspective on one how you see just that entire ecosystem developing and the role goldman can play in that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so theres no question that activities that were involved in are digitizing quickly i think theres a meaningful acceleration in the disruption that the digitalization of financial services is occurring there are places that that digitization is allowing us to disrupt and accelerate our position the two weve talked about a bunch today on this call that are happening because of digital infrastructure our ability to do what were doing in transaction banking is taking some of this digital disruption and using it in a different way what were doing in building a digital consumer bank is also relying on this the broader digital ecosystem i think is in early stages i think were at version i think youll continue to see a lot of disruption on traditional ways that financial services are delivered and consumed i think big competitive platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are intermediated i think there are lots of complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this as the technology allows for more disruption but i think were very early in the game and i think it is a big opportunity for the firm and the firm continues to be focused on it operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was hoping you could just elaborate on what drove the increase in rwas from the regulatory guidance this quarter please stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so we had about a billion increase in rwas about half of that related to the changes in the methodology that were using in the computation of the rwas and that was the byproduct of just routine and ongoing discussion with regulators and so that plays through in the third quarter ratio will play through on the forward but thats really the source of about of the rwa lift the other is obviously in the context of the overall business and risk and exposure thats attending there operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hello stephen hello david the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 15oct2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc hey gerard david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc stephen can you share with us you mentioned in transaction banking you got to the billion in deposits which is ahead of schedule and youre still confident youre going to reach the billion in revenues back in investor day when you gave us those numbers were those numbers linked meaning were they supposed to kind of be achieved around the same time and then second when do you think youll reach that billion target stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so the targets were set at the same time though bear in mind the environment then and now is quite different in the context of interest rates so weve seen fed funds come down from the time of investor day i dont know i want to say about basis points maybe a little more the consequence of that is that the value of deposits the economic value of deposits is not as rich now as we had imagined back at investor day but equally in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates well see a return to the value of those deposits otherwise modeled out and therefore on the forward rate curve our view is that well be able to achieve that billion revenue target id point out that of the billion more of them are operational thats sort of step one to achieving the value of that and that has been a big quarteronquarter increase from about the last quarter and i think more broadly in transaction banking about twothirds of the revenue from the time we modeled it through now is correlated to deposit intake with the balance around fx and other fees and so as we see interest rates come back the value of those deposits will as well operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so since there are no more questions id like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we hope to see many of you in the coming months if additional questions arise in the meantime please do not hesitate to reach out to carey and the investor relations team otherwise please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in january thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the goldman sachs
