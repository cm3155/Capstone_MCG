the appendix and with that i will hand over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks kristin good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today we had a successful and busy third quarter featuring continued strong execution of our strategic initiatives good financial performance with positive operating leverage and sequential ppnr growth and the announcement of three acquisitions we are playing offense and we feel that we are taking the steps to position us for solid growth and franchise value in earnings and in returns our financial performance in q3 reflects strong revenue growth up sequentially as both net interest income and fees grew nicely nii benefited from a pickup in spot loan growth with retail up and commercial up excluding ppp impact from loan forgiveness the gradual improvement in loan volumes we have expected is materializing though held back a modest amount in q3 by impacts from the delta variant on the recovery as well as by supply chain issues and labor shortages these impacts should continue to abate going forward and we expect even faster loan growth in q4 interestingly the amount of ppp forgiveness is roughly equivalent in the first and second halves of though q3 saw a meaningful pull forward which benefits q3 at the expense of q4 nonetheless the faster loan growth we expect in q4 should largely offset the lower ppp impact on q4 net interest income citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 strong sequential fee growth once again demonstrated the diversity of our business model mortgage had a bounce back quarter which helped offset some seasonality in capital markets fees while wealth hit a new record and consumer fees continued their recovery towards prepandemic levels we expect this diversification to play out again in q4 with capital markets poised for a strong quarter given exceptional pipeline and mortgage set for a seasonally softer quarter we kept expenses under control given our efficiency initiatives which led to positive sequential operating leverage of around and credit continues to be in great shape with ncos of basis points in the quarter well below our guidance range for the quarter of to basis points the strong results across expenses and credit should continue into q4 the strategic initiatives were focused on across consumer and commercial continue to go well and theres more on that in the presentation we feel we are focused on prioritizing the areas where we can differentiate ourselves and where we have a right to win the acquisitions weve announced yeartodate are all attractive from a strategic and financial standpoint and present only modest execution risk the investors of hsbc transactions give us a top deposit market share in new york city metro and over million new customers who collectively we feel we can do more for we also gained a big augmentation to our digital bank customer base from hsbcs online bank and we gained a branch network in washington dc and miami our integration efforts so far are progressing nicely our jmp acquisition is also strategically compelling upon closing the deal in mid q4 well have a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology healthcare and financial services plus we gained an equities business that is very well run focused and highly regarded as nonbank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continues to increase its important that we broaden our capabilities to be able to compete successfully in this new landscape we will increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base given these expanded capabilities also worth noting is that the willamette transaction dramatically expands our valuation services business with a prestigious outfit this capability is highly synergistic with our ma and broader capital markets effort so to sum up were taking serious strides forward as an organization in and we feel very good about our positioning and our future outlook with that ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone first ill start with the headlines for the quarter we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit revenue at billion was up linkedquarter given growth in both fee income and net interest income periodend loans were up in the quarter with strong originations in retail and commercial loans were up excluding ppp forgiveness giving us good momentum heading into the fourth quarter key highlights include strong results in capital markets notwithstanding seasonality another strong quarter for wealth and a rebound in mortgage fees and we delivered positive sequential operating leverage of over this quarter with wellcontrolled expenses we recorded a credit provision benefit of million which reflects strong credit performance with lower chargeoffs our acl ratio is now at excluding ppp loans we are in a very strong capital position with cet1 at after returning million to shareholders in dividends during the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 quarter and finally we continue to grow our tangible book value per share which was at quarterend up compared with a year ago next ill provide some key takeaways for the third quarter while referring to the presentation slides net interest income on slide was up linked quarter given interestearning asset growth stable net interest margin and higher day count the net interest margin was flat sequentially as the benefit of accelerated ppp forgiveness and improved funding costs were offset by the impact of higher cash balances as well as lower earningasset yields given low rates one highlight is our continued progress on lowering interestbearing deposit costs which are down basis points to basis points our asset sensitivity decreased to about from at the end of the second quarter the decrease primarily reflects loan and deposit exchanges and the addition of billion in receivedfixed swaps in the quarter we saw good entry points for the swaps given some steepening in the yield curve so far in the fourth quarter we have added another billion the hedging actions weve executed todate in are one of the levers we are pulling to address headwinds from swap run off and other impacts of a low rate environment we expect to continue adding to the receivedfixed swap portfolio and further moderate our asset sensitivity indiscernible while maintaining meaningful upside benefit to higher shortterm rates referring to slide we delivered solid fee results this quarter demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee income with strong results in capital markets and wealth mortgage fees rebounded in the quarter up million as production fees benefited from lower agency fees and we saw improvement in msr hedge results diving further into this performance production revenue was up million linked quarter benefiting from a modest improvement in gain on sale margins across channels given improved agency pricing and favorable execution this was partially offset by a decline in indiscernible down sequentially about which is broadly in line with industry level trends as expected we continue to see a shift towards purchase originations which increased from about of the total in second quarter to about in the third quarter the contribution from servicing operations decreased million linked quarter reflecting higher msr amortization our thirdparty servicing book grew to billion up linked quarter and yearoveryear lastly our msr hedging results improved million linked quarter given an unusually large negative result in q2 capital markets were down a bit from record levels reflecting seasonality particularly in syndication fees however ma advisory fees were higher and our pipeline heading into the fourth quarter is exceptionally strong wealth fees were up slightly continuing to build on record levels reflecting an increase in assets under management from net inflows moving on to other positive fee contributors we saw improvements in service charges and fee and card fees which benefited from a strengthening economy as debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed prepandemic levels on slide expenses were wellcontrolled up linked quarter as good expense discipline and the benefit of efficiency initiatives largely offset higher operational and travel costs periodend loans on slide were up linked quarter or excluding ppp retail loans were growing up and commercial loans were up excluding ppp in a tough operating environment average loans were down but still up excluding ppp citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 diving into drivers a bit more the diversity of our retail lending business produced another quarter of record originations but we continue to see high payoffs strength was noteworthy in mortgage auto and education commercial is seeing strong underlying activity with spot loans up in the quarter excluding ppp we had a very robust origination quarter led by commercial real estate asset backed lending and subscription line financing supporting dealrelated activity this was largely offset by continued elevated payoff activity which in part reflects favorable conditions for commercial companies to access the debt capital markets line utilization levels were up around basis points still near historic lows we foresee a gradual recovery in coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investment such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve themselves in addition our period end commitments are up around which will benefit us down the road once investment picks up overall spot loan growth of for the quarter exppp provides good underlying momentum for loan growth in the fourth quarter on slide deposit flows continue to be robust especially in lowcost categories and our liquidity ratios remained strong average deposits were up linked quarter and yearoveryear with strong demand in demand deposits which now make up of total deposits interestbearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline in term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and lowcost categories we continued to make good progress on deposit ph repricing with total deposit costs down basis points to basis points interestbearing deposit costs were down basis points to basis points during the quarter with opportunity to reduce further moving on to credit on slide and we saw excellent credit results this quarter net chargeoffs dropped from basis points to basis points for the third quarter driven by improvements across the portfolio nonaccrual loans decreased linked quarter given the improving outlook and strong performance of the portfolio our reserves decreased ending the quarter at exppp compared with at the end of the second quarter moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio remained stable at at the end of the third quarter after returning million in capital to shareholders through dividends in the quarter this is at the top of our list of capital priorities on the slide we paused our stock repurchase program pending the investor shareholder vote scheduled for november after the vote we have the opportunity to resume repurchases with million of capacity remaining under our current board authorization the estimated cet1 impact ph for the pending acquisitions are on the slide along with the targeted closing time before i move on to our outlook let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company on slide our top program is in its final stages everything is on track and we will achieve our targeted results we are preparing for the launch of a top program with more details to follow later this year these top programs have been critical in the funding of our strategic initiatives and in driving positive operating leverage which are key to achieving our mediumterm financial targets on the esg front im very excited to say that weve launched a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to generate a positive environmental impact by improving energy efficiency promoting sustainability and reducing greenhouse gases an area of high focus for us has been moving more rapidly to digital channels which we accelerated giving the behavioral changes weve seen coming out of the pandemic you can see some of the yearoveryear ph stats citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 on slide digital booked sales for example are up mobile active users are up and the number of zelle transactions are up we continue to enhance our digital capabilities and by the end of this year consumers will be able to perform about threequarters of all transactions directly through the mobile app and by the end of this will include nearly all transactions this provides us with strong leverage to continue repositioning our branches towards ph an advicebased model moving to slide as part of our ongoing efforts to help customers better navigate their financial lives weve recently announced several initiatives designed to make banking more transparent and accessible including a new way to avoid overdraft fees and a commitment to helping ensure that underserved communities have access to banking services we introduced citizens peace of mind a new deposit feature providing customers with the ability to avoid the unnecessary overdraft fees this feature will come with new capabilities to monitor and alert customers of overdraft withdrawals and a grace period to fund their account the financial impact of our overdraft policy fees will be to forego the return to historical overdraft fee levels you can expect service charges and fees to stabilize around yeartodate annualized levels the benefits of these changes are shown on the right side of slide we expect higher satisfaction lower attrition and lower operational costs to offset the forgone overdraft revenues over time lastly we also announced a new commitment to serving underbanked communities including the introduction of a new checking account with no overdraft fees and features that will meet the bank on national account standards these are designed to ensure that everyone has access to a transparent easytouse and affordable transactional account and now for some highlevel commentary on the outlook on slide we expect nii to be broadly stable to down slightly given a lower benefit from ppp forgiveness due to the pull forward into the third quarter nii is expected to be up around in the fourth quarter exppp impacts most importantly we are wellpositioned to see overall loan growth accelerate in the fourth quarter with average loans up to or to exppp and spot loan growth up around or around exppp we expect continued strength in retail across mortgage education and auto and in commercial we expect to see growth led by subscription line financing supporting dealrelated activity and assetbacked lending this loan growth positions us well for and helps offset the impact from ppp runoff fee income is expected to be broadly stable as a seasonal decline in mortgage as well as some expected pressure on margin given excess industry capacity is expected to be offset by some real strength in capital markets given exceptional pipelines noninterest expenses is expected to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter benefiting from our efficiency initiatives and we expect net charge offs will be broadly stable with the provision expense lower than net charge offs i should add that this guidance excludes the impact of the jmp acquisition which we are targeting to close in the middle of the fourth quarter to wrap up on slide this was a strong quarter for citizens with good momentum heading into the end of the year with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all right thank you john alan lets open it up to qa please citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun operator instructions well go to our first question that will be from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys thanks for taking my question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey lets see john maybe was hoping you could provide a little more color on whats going on with the swap book that youve been adding to i was hoping specifically you could sort of talk about the balance between adding new swaps and maintaining your rate sensitivity and in particular i guess what is your preferred sensitivity to higher rates in other words is there something specifically that were targeting or how should we be thinking about that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah just kind of big picture here i mean i think that weve as i mentioned seen some good opportunities to start in this new sort of steepening cycle to start layering in swaps broadly as i may have mentioned our asset sensitivity is down to about or so at the end of the third quarter as we migrate across the entire tightening cycle that may come we expect to try to migrate down to something that would be low single digits and in order to get there that would require not only the hedging that weve done todate which would be about billion in the third sorry in through october but would require in all likelihood another billion or so to get us to a low single digit asset sensitivity when we get near the top of the tightening cycle the other thing ill also offer up is that the acquisitions of isbc and hsbc will also add asset sensitivity and thatll require another billion or billion to offset so big picture our philosophy is to maintain good upside to shortterm rates which we have and the majority of our exposure is to shortterm rates and as we continue to see attractive opportunities to monetize that asset sensitivity as the yield curve steepens well continue to dollar cost average into that over time r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you i appreciate that and then switching gears just a little i was hoping you could talk about any differences in deposit growth trends that youre seeing between your retail and your commercial customers citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think were seeing good uptake and maybe well go ahead and let don and brendan highlight but in the third quarter we had growth both in average and spot of i think that that was driven primarily by commercial in the quarter but were seeing strong deposit flows on both sides were still seeing positive growth on both consumer and commercial and maybe ill just offer it up to don and brendan to see if they want to add anything else donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats right on the commercial side were still seeing a lot of deposit flow notwithstanding the fact were trying to push pricing down so we still have a little bit of surge deposits but probably billion or billion we see running off as we go into next year so we think deposits will continue to be strong well into bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah similar trends on the consumer side the noninterestbearing deposits have been very sticky despite consumer activity and spending picking up the deposits have been hanging around and so theyre still a bit elevated with the surge deposits the second and third rounds of stimulus generally were not spent they were more saved or used to pay down debt and were seeing that with the balances hanging around the customers pockets on the interestbearing side were seeing a rundown of cds and its generally replaced with low cost deposits with basic savings and some low interestbearing products like ph cv so thats allowing the cost of funds to continue to gear down consumer cost of funds allin is sub basis points now so were kind of at basement levels and still seeing the deposits very very sticky john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah one thing to add that with those surge deposits that we suspect most of that stays around and deposits stay relatively stable over time given organic growth offsets any potential marginal runoff of some of the covid related deposits so thats a good sign bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the one last point to add its bruce would be the demand deposits now are about of total deposits so thats been an effort where weve really focused on trying to raise that as a percentage of our total funding base and weve had some good success on the consumer side in mass affluent and growing the commercial side and so feel really good about where that sits thank you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good all right thank you very much operator well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank go ahead please citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was wondering if you could talk a bit about loan pricing trends and i guess especially in commercial where one of your peers yesterday talked about kind of continued pressure there as new loans have come on versus kind of whats ph rolling off in repricing donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah why dont i take that matt its don its holding up pretty well it depends on the type of transaction but were seeing a little bit of deterioration but not material so you see it in our nim our nim is holding up nicely were trying to stay disciplined so where we see things we havent changed our approach one bit so we look at overall return on relationships of which loan spread is a piece of it so well compromise a little bit our loan spread if we see other fee business attached to that loan but if we dont see the fee business were not going to chase yield just to book a loan brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah similar discipline in consumer id say theres some asset classes still are mildly elevated on what we would tend to see in this rate cycle like indiscernible spreads are a little bit expanded weve got front book back book challenges given the state of the yield curve at our back book the runoff is at a higher yield than what were putting on the front book returns are still very very strong id say theres one or two spots where were seeing some intensity of competition on returns particularly where theres fintechs involved whether its in point of sale or student lending in particular but were keeping our discipline and making sure were priced to adequate returns to support driving up our rotce and we feel good about able to get growth and make that balance as you can see in our numbers matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i guess taken together like as you think about growing loans it sounds like youre confident that the volume is enough to offset any margin or pricing pressure going forward brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah on the consumer side i do i see us continuing to be able to sort of moderately accelerate our pace of loan growth and keep in mind that our growth levels now when you think about the last question around elevated deposits in an environment where customers are also flush with cash so as that starts to draw down we expect loan growth to pick up even more as consumers need more leverage where right now theyre sitting on a lot of cash so we feel really good about the mediumterm for loan growth prospects donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and then why dont i add to that on the on the commercial side as john mentioned the highlight numbers are strong but were seeing our pipelines on the loan side not only on the capital markets side but on a loan side up quarteronquarter and then up another as we go into the fourth quarter were adding new citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 clients at a very good pace as we benefit from our expansion markets in particular and were growing our commitment book faster than our loan book so yeah as utilization begins to pick up itll be picking up off a larger commitment book so that all feels reasonably good as we sit here today matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator well move next to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead please gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john can we come back to the swap portfolio can you share with us what interest rate environment you will benefit the most from with the book that youve put on meaning rising shortterm rates by basis points or longterm rates going up by basis points can you kind of work through that and then second as part of that question if you didnt put the swap book on what would have the asset sensitivity been of your balance sheet today john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean ill just hit that with high level were more exposed to the short end of the curve than the long end so the asset its about short to long and rising frankly as we migrate through the cycle so the environment that will work well for us is when the fed lift off begins thats an environment that will really drive net interest margins and nii upward given the unhedged portion of our ci book and other floating rate exposures that we have so that still remains our most favorable sort of environment that would work well for us and to just give you a sense for with how the math plays out on that you know what basis point rise on the short end drives about million or so of nii for us if that helps you kind of quantify what were where the benefit comes from in terms of asset sensitivity we would be in the low teens low to midteens without continuing to hedge and its not really where our risk appetite is theres rates can go up and we hope to continue to do continue to go up but they can go down as well and so theres a risk profile there that over time were not only attempting to kind of preserve our asset sensitivity but were also cognizant of the that there is downside exposure that were taking off the table when we dollarcost average in with the swap book gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 very good thank you and then as a followup john you gave us some good data on slide on your digital metrics and i was curious when you look at your mobile active users what percentage of the households are mobile active users and then second when you look at your digital book sales great growth yearoveryear what percentage of your sales are now coming through that digital channel brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah great question its brendan yeah we look at a lot of different metrics on digital id say when we have the customers primary relationship the digital active users are incredibly high its over of our customer base so its digitally engaged so we feel good about that foundation our efforts now are moving from just general active to full service transactional banking done in a much more everyday way on mobile so weve got a lot of efforts underway across the company which are driving these metrics up including in the branches and in the call center efforts to communicate and nudge our customers to get more engaged with digital its hugely retentive for us with our customers but also as you know if we can get them really engaged we can pivot the branches more to advice and theres a cost dynamic here at play that we can then go back and reinvest in the top of the funnel for customer acquisition growth so we feel really good about the trends in mobile and i see a lot of upside here looking forward gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah go ahead bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible percentage of digital sales brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island oh percentage im sorry percentage of digital sales yeah its rapidly growing and its very different category by category so some of our lending businesses are principally digital first and youll see in things like student a to rate of digital whereas in something like dda and deposits its more in the to range but growing two years ago it was in the range so were seeing active upticks the branch channel for basic deposit products is still the largest source of customer acquisition but theres some balance coming into play gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator and for our next question well go to the line of ken usdin with jefferies go ahead please citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning guys hey john on the other side of the rate sensitivity you had previously talked about wanting to keep the securities book around midteens of earning assets and i see that youve added some securities at period end versus average given what were seeing in the environment whats your appetite for continuing to move some of that excess cash into the book and any change thoughts visàvis what youve already talked about on swaps in terms of what you want to do and where you want the securities book to go thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i appreciate the question i think that you may see the securities book rise but as it relates to a percentage of total interest earning assets were still in that mode of around midteens or thereabouts it could tick up a little bit but theres not really any plans for a large change in the percentage of securities to interestearning assets and i think the reason for that is twofold one is that given our loan growth opportunity really thats our preference is that we would prefer to deploy our excess liquidity into our loan opportunities which from when you look at our consumer lending which is the diversity of that and seeing commercial starting to really lift off a bit thats where we want to put that cash and so thats what the plan would be in the near term for that to head in that direction i think the other aspect of it is that we just have a view that the rate risk hedging which the securities books can also do double duty on we think its a bit more efficient to do that off balance sheet with swaps and so thats still the plan dollar cost average over time in that space ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it and john on nii in the slide deck you talked about ppp being a basis point increase sequentially can just level set us on how much ppp was in the nii and just what you expected to trail that out of as far as the program runs down thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean big picture youve got i mean i think the way i would talk about that is that all throughout the year weve had a sense that ppp was going to be about the same first half and second half and thats playing out but there has been a million increase in the third quarter versus the second quarter in ppp contribution to nii that million really is coming from the fourth quarter so really thats really the how its all going to play out is that million increase in ppp from to and then because of the pull forward from a million decrease from to on ppp but i would hasten to add that exppp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter were seeing nii growth exppp and thats really good to see and i think we mentioned that were up about in terms of nii exppp so a lot of that ppp downdraft is getting offset given the fact that our guide is really stable to down only slightly ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah okay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ken i would just add that this has been an issue of great interest for analysts and investors like whats been the impact of ppp we always view it as something that was transitory that eventually these were nice earning assets for us for but they would very quickly start to reduce and then they would fall off and that had much of an impact on so the real key was can we develop enough loan growth to basically substitute core consumer loans in particular for the ppp loans that are running off and we think with the spot loan growth we had in q3 and what were expecting in q4 mission accomplished that well be in good position to offset any future impacts as it relates to the first half and all of ken usdin q analyst jefferies company absolutely and i guess one quick one in how much john and bruce is still running off from the other retail because i know you have the citizens pay presumably growing in there but whats weighing against that thanks guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah whats weighing against that is the personal unsecured portfolio that we ran up about two years ago and then decided its best when the covid hit to run that back down and stop new originations so thats been a little bit of a dead weight in the unsecured area which masks a little bit the nice growth weve had in citizens pay and some of the rebounding that were seeing in card brendan you may have the exact numbers so whats left of that at this point brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its about a little shy of million left on the personal loan book and its about millionish of a drag quarteronquarter to loan growth its one of the other books thats in rundown mode versus ph marine rv as well thats much smaller indiscernible brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island the biggest drag is really the personal loan book so million or so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thanks very much citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator we will go next to john pancari with evercore go ahead please john pancari q analyst evercore group llc morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc also on the loan front i know on the line utilization you indicated the bps increase and the gradual recovery expected can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on the areas of expected strength as you see that rebound in line utilization taking hold i know you mentioned the subscription finance ma and abl is that the areas where you continue to expect that momentum to build or do you expect that to broaden and if you could comment on what areas thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill make a few comments and don will elaborate on that i mean i think the areas that were seeing looking forward into commercial is weve seen strength in asset back securitizations that will we see that continuing subscription line finance as i mentioned in my remarks in part due to ma activity is an area of continued growth cre is a place where were seeing some good uptake maybe in the office space with ph built to suit and in the industrial space as well so thats starting to contribute now as well and then to your point about ci utilization i mean i think two points related to it so were seeing commitments rising and even if utilization doesnt really lift off that still provides some loan growth even if utilization levels are up just a very tiny bit if overall commitments are up then that still creates a positive contribution and theres a handful of sectors that are driving that youve got construction energy manufacturing are a couple of the areas and it is somewhat broadbased its a small increase but somewhat broadbased number of sectors where were seeing small increases in utilization and maybe just turn it over to don for any donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think you kind of covered john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think the good the good news john is that we are seeing in our core middle market and ci book the beginnings of a little bit of daylight in terms of utilization as john said in the opening remarks clearly the supply chain labor issue is restraining the performance of some companies so they would be performing better than they even are now if they didnt have some of the supply chain problems but we in the last couple of months were beginning to see some core ci utilization the financial capital markets oriented which is where subscription lines and abs and the indiscernible have been really strong all year and we expect them to continue to be strong as we get into the fourth quarter and into next year so combination indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and then don you probably also you hit on the point the middle market is where youre seeing that take up on line utilization bigger companies large donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island companies that dont have access to capital markets so the challenge that weve had on loan growth is predominantly pay downs because people are going to the capital market bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the bigger companies donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island given the strength of the capital markets so the middle market guys are beginning to see some light at the end of the indiscernible part of it is just ceo confidence frankly they really really really squeeze down on their companies and as they begin to see covid really begin to wane theyre beginning to grow their companies a little bit quicker at the margin bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah good john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks and then separately on the capital markets business i know you mentioned a few times a very very solid deal pipeline there can you maybe talk to us about how youre thinking about that line when you look at as youre budgeting and then also can you remind us how much we should assume that falls to the bottom line in that business particularly as the top line momentum really builds thanks citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think we continue to get more and more optimistic about i was sitting here maybe midyear saying wow is really a banner year theres a lot of this that may be keying off potential tax changes both on the ma side and on the capital markets side but our pipelines continue to build and we think its going to be very strong as we go into next year i think my general view is youve got an environment where youre going to have a relatively strong economy youre going to have relatively low interest rates and youre going to have very high liquidity and thats a very very strong backdrop for one of the things that weve got our eye on and we just dont know yet is how much is going to get pulled into so were going to have to be rebuilding pipelines maybe in the first quarter to get going so you may see a fourth quarterfirst quarter kind of swing but well have to wait till the balance of the year to see that and i dont really id say the i dont know what the marginal contribution is its actually lower than the lending business because the comp payouts are higher but i dont have that number at the tip of my fingers and remember we pay a lot of different people we pay bankers we pay corporate finance people we pay ma people we pay capital markets people so it all blends together and the way i look at it is our overall efficiency ratio is actually pretty good and were bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island of course john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so we got efficiency ratio it washes out to the bottom line bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would just add too that we see these secular trends we see private equity pools of capital growing and looking to put money to work opportunity to gain some very attractive leverage levels and financing costs are low so those trends will continue and one of the reasons why were hellbent on assembling broader capabilities including what weve done with some of the ma boutique acquisitions and jmp is we want to be an intermediary in those flows of putting money to work and if our middle market companies want to sell themselves we can take them to market and get a good price so weve got the customer base we increasingly have the product capabilities and so thats reason for optimism in and of itself i think well continue to gain a lot of synergies as we look out into john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and the only thing id add to that bruce is with jmp coming on board its the last piece of the puzzle really so not only do we have full service capabilities to help our clients do whatever they need to do weve got a nice diversity in terms of product sets so itll let us benefit when markets are good in the equities or the debt markets and vice versa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions well go next to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim we seem to have lost your line if you took yourself out of the queue there we go one moment your line is open go ahead please ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just a couple of quick followups one i think as we look through the deal closings one i guess were still on track for a closing for hsbc and investors any risk of a delay there and remind us as you close those transactions are there any aspects of those balance sheets where we could see any runoff that may impact results as we look pro forma for the deal john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey ill go ahead and start ebrahim its john so the expectation for hsbc is to close midfirst quarter and thats very much on track were deep into the sort of preparations for that its both a close and a conversion on indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island have the regulatory approval in hand john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly we have regulatory approvals in hand on that transaction so that one is looking just exactly as we expected and i think the other larger transaction which was indiscernible overall one big strategic allocation of capital but isbc is a separate legal entity that were weve got the shareholder vote scheduled for november and the regulatory approvals are pending on that the expectation and target for that is that we citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 receive those approvals sometime in early and we have an opportunity to close that in but nevertheless thats pending and well keep monitoring it as it relates to runoff were not expecting to have runoff well i think the way weve described it is that we would continue those businesses but the front book sort of activities would have a different profile than the back book in particular with investors because of all the capabilities that were bringing to the table and so were not expecting to have us have any meaningful runoff but we are expecting the loan book to have a different profile a year or two down the line given more ci and more consumer lending that well be able to generate off that platform as you look ahead bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add a couple of points there john first off on hsbc the price is tied to what comes over so if there is any runoff we would have a shock absorber there in terms of what the ultimate premium is that we pay and secondly just when it comes to jmp were working very diligently to try to get that closed mid fourth quarter here so we should have four to six weeks in the results here in q4 which would be accretive of course ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just one separate question you all spend a lot of time on the payments with citizen pay sic citizens pay what youre doing in buy now pay later when you think about zelle and you put a stat about growth in zelle is there more that you think and i understand you dont call the shots in zelle but do you think zelle should be doing more in terms of enabling banks such as yourself to compete with some of the tech players in the business in terms of instore payments et cetera brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its brendan look i think zelle the rails that have been built for zelle are adequate and i think the industry including citizens needs to take control of the ui layer that sits above the rails and innovate on our own around the customer experience whether its peertopeer payments thats facilitated with zelle or whether its purchasing something direct with a merchant which would be more a citizens pay platform so were making big investments in both of those environments so you can you see a world where those capabilities converge a little bit and its a similar experience whether youre buying something from a merchant or whether youre sending money to a friend i think thats possible but i think the rails are adequate i dont necessarily think zelle in particular needs to do anything dramatic to innovate i think its more around what we can do in the ui layer to make things easier for customers to increase engagement as you can see our numbers thats happening and we continue to want to scale that up further and get more customers deeper engaged ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc extremely helpful bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 its just focusing on the use cases and where we can differentiate ourselves and so weve got a central effort enterprise payments capability thats really coordinating between commercial and consumer to drive our decision making there and make sure that were investing in things that will really drive future growth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator and for our next question we will go to the line of vivek juneja go ahead please vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions just a clarification the ppp so youve not given numbers and maybe that might make it easier but if i look at the basis points that seems to equate to about million in terms of the change from to i heard you mentioned million so im trying to understand what am i missing there when we do that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i mean as ive said is it easier to just give the numbers what it was in and bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we did give the numbers that it is a million delta and the reason that it shows basis points on that is theres a numerator effect and a denominator effect vivek so you have loans running off which affects the denominator so it really doubles the impact you probably have about basis points from the nii pickup and then you get three to four for having the loan balances run down and be forgiven vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats helpful bruce and the rollon rolloff on the securities yields how is that going can you give us some color where that stands and how much further john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure i mean so weve had several quarters going back for a while now with securities yield falling and i think the dynamic there is not only to the pure front book back book which has been negative by about basis citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 points or so but also youve got premium amortization which has been a drag and i think our outlook however is for that to stabilize and frankly start to turn around in the fourth quarter i think in large degree we will see the pure front book back book start to narrow call it fall to something in the neighborhood of basis points but at the same time were also seeing as rates rise premium amortization will also slow and thatll provide a net positive to securities yields in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so yeah thats really were at about an inflection point there vivek so with that steeper curve as john indicated front book back book when you factor in reduced amortization were now going to see that turn to be a tailwind from being a headwind for the first three quarters of the year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah if i may one more the other retail youve been talking about citizens pay youve signed up a lot of partners hard to see although because its overcast by the runoff portfolio what are you seeing in those loans in terms of growth that is citizens pay related is there some numbers that you can give us because obviously the bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its yearonyear growth vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc combined number doesnt look so great but i recognize its muddied brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the growth in citizens pay has been pretty substantial so all things kind of buy now pay later is up around yearoveryear with balances and we continue to see that accelerate weve got a lot of activity in the back half of this year on bringing on new clients and it takes a while for these things to ramp theyve got a we pilot them they come online we work with merchants to bring them to life to market them to their customers so its a bit of a rampup period and so all the leading activities that need to happen to continue to have confidence that this can scale through and beyond are there so we feel pretty good that its headed in the right direction were building a lot of new technical capabilities thats broadening out our value proposition within citizens pay as well so underlying very good healthy growth bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sounds like indiscernible that we could probably shed some light to be a little more transparent in that unsecured area for future presentation at a conference or in our general releases so thanks for the question citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2021 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode
