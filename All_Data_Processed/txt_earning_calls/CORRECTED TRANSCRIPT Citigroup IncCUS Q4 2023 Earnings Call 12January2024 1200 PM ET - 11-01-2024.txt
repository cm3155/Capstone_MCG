to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jenn and a very happy new year to everyone and i hope you all had a good break at citi were back at it and given the notable items and our new financial reporting structure weve got a lot to cover today so im going to get right to it was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress simplifying citi and executing the strategy we laid out at investor day with that said the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing today im going to provide a highlevel view on our progress in discuss our q4 results and finish with our priorities for we know that is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our mediumterm target and our transformation so turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy as you can see on slide in we saw a record year for services where we maintained our number one ranking amongst large institutions in tts with client wins up and a sustained winloss rate above weve now gained over basis points in share in securities services since in wealth we added an estimated billion in net new assets during the year in uspb we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth and we began to see the early fruits of our investments in key talent in banking in september we began the most consequential series of changes for the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis we restructured around five core interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 you can now see in our financials the fullyear returns and pl bybusiness while they are all impacted by investments and transformation expense it is clear where we have work to do the simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of the first quarter and will result in over billion of run rate saves from the net elimination of almost roles namely managers as mark will detail this will contribute to the reduction of our expenses in over the medium term between simplification benefits of the transformation stranded costs and other productivity efforts we expect to eliminate positions exmexico resulting in over billion in run rate saves simplification is also enabling citi to be more clientfocused and less bureaucratic realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our mediumterm revenue target with this new structure im holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products in addition having achieved client offers are apt to ensure were disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients we have now completed the divestitures of of our international consumer franchises and have wound down nearly of our total retail loans and deposits in russia korea and china weve restarted the sales process in poland and are well down the execution path for the mexico ipo next year were exiting marginal businesses such as munis and a subset of distressed trading to focus on our core strength and allocate our capital with rigor now without doubt all these changes are difficult but they are necessary at the same time we continued to invest in our transformation risk and control environment and data architecture and we were pleased to have closed the fx consent order with the federal reserve were committed to fulfilling the expectations of our regulators given the unique role we play in the global financial system the modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients during the year we consolidated trading and reporting platforms and retired of our legacy applications for the second yearin a row these enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses such as hiring commercial bankers to capture share improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our global network and automating processes for our security services clients it was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires including andy sieg the simplified reporting structure is being embraced by colleagues were feeling empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders while mark will go through the details id like to level set on our disappointing fourth quarter before recapping the full years results earlier this week we disclosed additional external headwinds some of which materialized in the second half of december including a billion reserve build related to transfer risk stemming from exposures to argentina and russia we also saw a nearly million negative revenue impact as the result of the largerthanexpected devaluation of the argentine currency these items together with the billion fdic assessment drove this quarter to a negative eps of and while these items are clearly very painful they are quite idiosyncratic in nature and will not impact the course we have set in terms of the performance of our five businesses while services was the most impacted by the argentine devaluation the underlying growth remains very strong driven by share gains and client wins overall services revenues were up for the full year despite the impact at the argentine devaluation in tts crossborder transactions were up and aucaua in securities services were up by close to trillion for the year citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 in markets our fixed income results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in december particularly in rates and fx markets was also impacted by the argentine devaluation with franchises well positioned with our corporate clients we continue to take actions to improve returns whether by redeploying capital to highreturning products or exiting products which arent a strategic fit we had a decent quarter in equities particularly in derivatives and we saw growth in prime balances an area we have been focusing on while activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up overall banking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally investment banking was up slightly for the year and we finished as the fifth leading franchise we certainly aspire to be better were seeing improved confidence amongst ceos and we like our pipeline but of course the timing for robust recoverys uncertain the share gains weve made in areas such as health care put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively while investment activity in asia rebounded with quarterly revenues up and wealth at work up for the year overall wealth revenues were down in and we fully recognize that this business isnt where it needs to be andy is off to a fast start in addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet hes tightening our focus to build feebased revenue streams and investment aum with trillion in new wealth to be created by mainly in north america and asia and with our clients holding trillion away from us we have an important affinity here to drive growth and returns to where they should be uspb was a bright spot with every product up doubledigits in the quarter compared to last year including retail banking which benefited from a rebound in mortgage origination new and refreshed products have increased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments weve made and in cards ieb and anr continued their growth reflecting a more balanced lend versus spend mix and falling payment rates as expected loss rates are now back to prepandemic levels driven by customers in the lower fico bands in terms of the full year in we grew revenues exdivestitures by although the argentine devaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the billion revenue mark we met our fullyear expense guidance and we increased our cet1 ratio to during the year we grew our tangible book value per share by to and we returned billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share buybacks we remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels as i reflect on the year i also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically and im very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times looks to be similar to in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation we expect to see growth slowing globally with the us wellpositioned to withstand a runofthemill resection should one materialize with a strong balance sheet ample liquidity and diligent risk management we are wellpositioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to pass moreover we think environments like these play to our strengths given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation i recognize the importance of this year and i am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions weve taken through the momentum of our businesses backed by investments in key products we believe we can continue to grow revenues exdivestitures by to over the medium term overall we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environment to reach our mediumterm return target and return capital to our shareholders whilst continuing the investments needed in our transformation citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 with that id like to turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted otherwise to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone we have a lot to cover on todays call im going to start with the fourth quarter and fullyear firmwide financial results focusing on yearoveryear comparisons unless i indicate otherwise ill also focus on our guidance for and end with the path to our mediumterm return target the presentation of our results reflects the changes weve made in conjunction with our organizational simplification including reporting legacy franchises and corporateother in all other however before i go into the results let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8k we recently filed at the top right of slide we show these items on a pretax basis the fdic special assessment of approximately billion related to regional bank failures in march this impacted expenses in all other a restructuring charge of approximately million related to actions associated with our organizational simplification which will drive head count reductions and future savings over the medium term impacted expenses in all other the impact of the currency devaluation in argentina of approximately million this was recorded in noninterest revenue across services markets and banking and you can see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation while we did have a diverse impact from the argentina devaluation this quarter we also benefited from high interest rates earning approximately million of nii on the net investment in the quarter given the hyperinflationary environment and a reserve build of billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures to russia and argentina as described in the 8k this impact is mostly included in other provisions and cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality the combination of these items negatively impacted diluted eps by approximately and rotce by basis points now turning to the left side of the slide where we show our financial results for the full firm in the fourth quarter we reported a net loss of billion and a net loss per share of on billion of revenue excluding the notable items diluted eps would have been with an rotce of for the quarter in the quarter total revenues decreased by on a reported basis excluding divestiturerelated impacts and the impact of the argentina devaluation revenues increased driven by strength across services uspb and investment banking partially offset by lower revenues in markets and wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exits and winddowns turning to expenses we reported expenses of billion which include the fdic special assessment and modest divestiturerelated costs excluding these items expenses increased to billion largely driven by the restructuring charge i just mentioned cost of credit was approximately billion dollars excluding the reserve build for transfer risk cost of credit was primarily driven by card net credit losses which are now at pre covid levels as well as acl builds for new card volume at the end of the quarter we had nearly billion in total reserves with the reservetofunded loan ratio of approximately and on a fullyear basis we delivered billion of net income and an rotce of adjusting for the notable items net income was approximately billion with an rotce of on slide we show full year revenue trends by business from to it is important to highlight that in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure we move the majority of the financing and securitization business from banking to markets we also implemented a revenue sharing citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 arrangement within banking and between banking services and markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationshipbased lending these changes are now reflected in our results and our historical financials now looking at the fullyear numbers services had a record year with revenues of billion up benefiting from both rates and business actions new client wins and deepening with existing clients partially offset by the argentina devaluation markets revenues decreased to billion largely driven by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in december the markets business was also impacted by the argentina devaluation banking revenues decreased to billion primarily driven by the marktomarket on loan hedges as well as a decrease in corporate lending investment banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as we gained share amidst a declining wallet corporate lending revenues were down excluding marktomarket on loan hedges wealth revenues decreased to billion primarily due to the deposit mix shift towards higher yielding products which drove lower deposit spreads uspb revenues increased to billion primarily driven by growth in card balances as we continue to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisitions and customer engagement total revenues excluding divestitures came in at billion below our guidance of billion to billion for the year largely due to the impact of the argentina devaluation softer markets performance particularly in december and losses on loan hedges however nii exmarkets came in at billion in line with our guidance despite the challenging environment and the impact of the argentina devaluation we grew firmwide revenues by approximately ex divestitures in line with our investor day target demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model and the investments weve been making on slide we show full year expense trends from to excluding the fdic special assessment and divestiturerelated impacts fullyear expenses were billion for in line with our guidance as i mentioned this includes roughly million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational simplification and additional severance costs of approximately million which included actions to address stranded costs and start to rightsize the businesses relative to the prior year expense growth continue to be driven by transformation and businessled investments volumerelated expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology partially offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses in legacy franchises within all other over the past few years weve been investing across these themes which has not only impacted the performance of the firm but also the businesses on slide we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from to over the past three years we have invested significantly in our infrastructure platforms application processes and data as you can see in the bar chart at the top of the slide roughly of our transformation investment over the last three years were in technology with the remainder related to nontech employees and consultants in weve seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as weve gotten deeper into the execution of our transformation and you should expect to see this trend continue in total we invested over billion in technology in beyond transformation our technology investments are also focused on digital innovation new product development client experience enhancements and areas that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics across branded cards and retail services approximately of our card loans are to consumers with fico scores of or higher and across both portfolios ncl rates have reached precovid levels but we continue to be wellreserved with a reserveto funded loan ratio of in our corporate portfolio the majority of our exposure is investmentgrade which is reflected in our low level of nonaccrual loans at basis points of total corporate loans we feel good about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are wellreserved for the current environment as it relates to argentina weve included a slide in the appendix summarizing the value it brings to the global network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold as well as the strength of our financial profile in argentina as it relates to russia weve also included a slide in the appendix you will see that the reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investments and therefore our risk of loss related to russia on slide we show our summary balance sheet and key capital liquidity metrics we maintain a very strong trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a welldiversified trillion deposit base which is deployed into highquality diversified assets the majority of our deposits billion are institutional and operational in nature and span across countries and are complemented by billion of us personal banking and wealth deposits we have approximately billion of hqla and approximately billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of billion our lcr decreased modestly to and our tangible book value per share was up on the bottomleft corner of the slide we show a full cet1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in first we generated billion of net income to common which added basis points second we returned billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases which drove a reduction of about basis points third we benefited from the impact of lower rates on our afs investment portfolio which drove an increase of basis points and finally the remaining basis points was largely driven by higher rwa partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets we ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio approximately basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of as you can see weve grown our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points over the course of the year while returning over billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases before i take you through each business as jane mentioned were not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses and therefore we are laserfocused on executing against our strategy simplifying the organization and rightsizing the expense base as a reminder the investments that weve been making have impacted each of the businesses as you will see in the next few slides so now turning to slide where we show the results for services for the fourth quarter and the full year revenues were up this quarter largely driven by nii across tts and security services partially offset by nir driven by the argentina devaluation services noninterest revenues were up excluding the impact of the argentina devaluation expenses increased primarily driven by continued investments in technology product innovation and client experience cost of credit was million driven by a reserve build of approximately million primarily associated with transfer risk in russia and argentina net income decreased to million as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 average loans were up primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in tts both in north america and internationally average deposits were down as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisition and deepening with existing clients however sequentially deposits were up services delivered an rotce of for the quarter and for the full year services delivered an rotce of on billion of revenue on slide we show the results for markets for the fourth quarter and the full year markets revenues were down versus a strong quarter last year driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the devaluation partially offset by an increase in equities fixed income revenues decreased by largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in december as well as the impact of devaluation however we saw a good underlying momentum in equities with revenues up driven by gains across all products and we continued to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue to rwa target expenses increased driven by investments in transformation and risk and controls and volumerelated cost partially offset by productivity savings cost of credit was million driven by a reserve build of approximately million primarily associated with the transfer risk in russia and argentina markets reported a net loss of million as revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit average loans increased to billion as we saw increased client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending average trading assets increased to billion largely driven by treasuries and mortgagebacked securities given the strong client activity in fixed income for much of the year while it was a challenging quarter markets performed relatively well for the full year with revenue of billion and an rotce of compared with very strong performance in the prior year and we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth expense discipline and capital optimization on slide we show the results for banking for the fourth quarter and the full year banking revenues increased driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges partially offset by lower corporate lending revenue investment banking revenues increased yearoveryear driven by dcm and advisory due to improvements in market sentiment in advisory we saw signs of strength across technology healthcare and energy and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline corporate lending revenues excluding marktomarket on loan hedges decreased largely driven by lower revenue share from investment banking services and markets expenses increased primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year excluding the reserve release expenses were roughly flat cost of credit was million driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in russia and argentina the ncl rate was basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of banking reported a net loss of million as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset higher revenues rotce was negative for the quarter and for the full year banking reported an rotce of negative on billion of revenue so clearly we have more work to do on returns and while its difficult to predict when activity will normalize were positioning the business to capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet and that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas upgrading talent in traditional sectors and continuing to rightsize the business on slide we show the results for wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year wealth revenues decreased driven by lower deposit spreads partially offset by lower mortgage funding costs and higher investment fee revenues were seeing good momentum in noninterest revenue which was up in the fourth quarter driven citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 by higher investment assets increased client activity and market performance expenses were up primarily driven by investments in risk and technology partially offset by repacing strategic investments in tighter expense control as we begin to rightsize the expense base in the business wealth reported a net income of million as revenues were mostly offset by higher expenses client balances increased primarily driven by higher client investment assets partially offset by lower deposit balance average loans were flat as we continued to optimize capital usage average deposits decreased reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higheryielding investments on citis platform client investment assets were up driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuation and were seeing good momentum in net new assets which more than doubled to billion for the quarter for the full year we added an estimated billion in net new assets rotce was for the quarter and for the full year rotce was on billion of revenue looking ahead were going to improve the returns in the business as we invest in talent to execute on our refocused strategy to drive investment revenue with an eye towards rightsizing the expense base we will wind down noncore initiatives exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line on slide we show the results for us personal banking for the fourth quarter and the full year us personal banking revenues increased branded cards revenues increased driven by higher net interest margin an interestearning balances growth of and we continue to see healthy growth in new account acquisition up and spend volumes up retail services revenues increased also driven by higher net interest margin and interestearning balance growth of as well as lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses retail banking revenues increased driven by higher deposit spreads loan growth and improved mortgage margins expenses decreased as higher expenses to support lending programs and client engagement as well as rollout of simplified banking were offset by lower nonvolumerelated expenses cost of credit of billion increased driven by higher ncls partially offset by a lower acl build net income increased to million driven by higher revenues partially offset by higher cost of credit average deposits decreased driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business we continue to make progress against our digital strategy with digital deposits up and active digital users increasing rotce for the quarter was and for the full year us personal banking delivered an rotce of on billion of revenue here again were focused on improving the return profile of the business managing through this part of the credit cycle and continuing to make progress in retail banking will be key on slide we show results for all other on a managed basis which includes corporateother and legacy franchises and excludes divestiturerelated items revenues decreased driven by a decrease in nii of driven by the closed exits and winddowns partially offset by higher noninterest revenue and expenses increased to billion driven by the fdic special assessment and restructuring cost partially offset by lower expenses in both winddown and exit markets turning to slide as we kickoff the environment remains somewhat uncertain and markets remain difficult to predict but based on what we see today we expect revenues to be approximately billion to billion as shown on the left side of the slide and on the right side of the slide we list the key drivers in tts we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins deepening with our existing clients and continued momentum with commercial clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 innovation in securities services we have a very healthy pipeline and will continue to onboard assets under custody from new mandates win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients in investment banking we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers over time we do expect the investments that weve made in key growth areas such as health care and technology to allow us to gain share and we also expect a modest rebound in wealth as we execute on our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees particularly with our existing clients in uspb we expect continued growth in card balances driven by the investments weve been making as well as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth we also expect to continue to improve our retail branch performance and as it relates to nii excluding markets we expect net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more than offset by lower us rates and the reduction from the closed exits and winddowns turning to slide we expect expenses to be approximately billion to billion down from billion subject to volumerelated expenses the decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification a continued reduction from exit markets and winddowns and productivity savings partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volumerelated expenses embedded in this guidance includes an elevated level of severance as well as additional potential costs related to the organizational simplification totaling approximately million to billion this will contribute to reducing head count over and the medium term which we will discuss on the next slide on slide we show the drivers of head count and expense reduction over the medium term as weve discussed in the past there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses organizational simplification including the reduction of management layers eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets and realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology we expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our head count by a net excluding mexico and generate a net run rate save of billion to billion over the medium term this will underpin our path to billion to billion of expenses subject to volumerelated expenses both the head count and expense reduction will allow us to rightsize the firm and businesses to improve performance and return on slide we show our outlook for us cards in in terms of credit performance based on the trends that were seeing we expect ncl rates both in branded cards and retail services portfolios to rise above pre covid levels and peak in on a fullyear basis for we expect the branded cards ncl rate to be in the range of to and the retail services ncl rate to be in the range of to from an allowance perspective we are reserved for a weighted eightquarter average unemployment rate of almost which embeds a downside scenario of approximately acl build in will primarily be a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the probabilities associated with them and we expect continued momentum in cards albeit more in line with midsingledigit loan growth on slide we summarize our mediumterm targets from a revenue perspective we continue to expect to revenue cagr in the medium term including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits and the winddowns from an expense perspective were now on the path to lowering our expenses beginning in from a credit perspective we expect credit costs to be a function of portfolio mix volumes and macro citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 assumptions and we have committed to returning capital to our shareholders and in fact expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the first quarter of so to wrap it up while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since investor day our strategy has not and we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our to rotce in the medium term with that jane and i will be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions okay our first question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i looked in detail at the earnings presentation especially slide and i think the question is on many peoples minds i count restructurings at citigroup and i count restructurings out of sale at citigroup you might disagree with the number it could be it could be it could be it could be more but ive not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring so the question is why is this time different number one who is this new and improved citigroup number two why arent expenses down even move especially when few people that i talk to think youll hit your revenue target and three jane what is your conviction level of getting to that to rotce in or thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well thank you very much indeed mike ill start with who is citi citi is im delighted to say finally simple at investor day i set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients across border needs that vision was based on five core interconnected businesses we set off on a deliberate path to get there and over the last three years weve done so page is who we are today we are five interconnected businesses no more no less we have our organization that now aligns with those five businesses and this enables us to focus on two priorities the first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses so that we can meet the mediumterm rotce target we laid out and the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation and i would also be i need to note that i fully recognize that is an inflection year mike and i and the management team are accountable to deliver and that you and our investors have the transparency you need to hold us accountable so why is this time different look its not lost on me that theres been many attempts in the past to change this firm i and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past and youve got proof points of the last threeyears where weve made a lot of tough decisions and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple citi that we are today we completely reset our strategy so we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 weve announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model and frankly from my perspective more importantly how we run the bank since the financial crisis aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability youve seen me move quickly were on track with our execution of this effort and it will generate over billion of run rate saves the end of the first quarter purely from the organization efforts that weve put in that we announced in september weve done this while investing and i think this is another difference weve invested heavily in our transformation and while that was catalyzed by our consent orders these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation from wellgoverned data from consolidated platforms we also have made significant investments in our business to support the to revenue growth and to ensure client momentum and those investments have helped us expand our product suite invest in digital capabilities automate our processes capture synergies through the client organization weve also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas including andy to lead wealth and we now have a good balance between experienced citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization so we are doing things the right way were doing it for the long term and were moving with urgency we will need and are spending the money that we need to to address our regulatory requirements but thats already embedded in our path to the to rotce in the medium term and this already feels like a different bank we have more work to do i recognize is a critical year and as i said the decks are much clearer now so that we can focus on two imperatives improving our business performance and executing the transformation neither is an entirely linear path as weve seen over the last threeyears we all know that we get we have to build our credibility were committed to doing so and we are providing far more transparency around the business performance so investors have a better sense of how were doing and i and my management team to your final question are fully accountable for getting this all done we will mark expenses mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks jane and why arent expenses down more i think to your point jane weve been investing in the franchise both on the frontend and importantly on the transformation and the risk and controls what i would point out is that in we delivered expenses of billion ex the fdic charge that is the guidance that we gave but i also highlight that we also included million associated with the restructuring charge that is more than i had articulated in the way of guidance so the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year we use that in a smart way we use that to fund the org simplification cost so that we can realize the savings down the line and were going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion that means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that to and to your point if revenues are to come down or come in lower than expected well adjust the expenses accordingly operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so youre clearly making a lot of progress and i hate to like ask this question too early but i think it is important your expense guidance good your revenue guide good and you have your arms around the expenses the question i have is how do you think about balancing that nearterm profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments because if you look around the world theres a lot of places to grow whether it be a branch network or the wealth management aspirations that you have or the digital investments so how do we know that all the right future investments are being made while you extract costs in all the good ways that youve been doing mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks glenn i guess ill start and jane feel free to add in on it look it is a balancing act right and we do look at each of our five core businesses we obviously are clear on the strategy but wheres the growth where are the return opportunities associated with them and how do we ensure were deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time we have to juxtapose that against the required investment to modernize our operations and were making those tradeoffs on a regular basis but importantly when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities were trying to be agile about it which means if those opportunities dont play out in the way were expecting because the cycle just doesnt mature or materialize in that fashion weve got to be disciplined enough to dial them back and thats what youve seen over the past year plus is that weve been investing in the business where we didnt see the upside that we anticipated we dialed back that spend all right and thats the type of iterative process if you will glenn that were putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this were still positioned to capture growth investment banking for example we have invested in health care in technology building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds we feel good about that weve done similar things in the way of our wealth business were investing heavily in our tts franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there so its that type of discipline thats required it is sometimes a tradeoff but its one that weve been very focused on being smart about glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that maybe a quickie on services obviously up in the record is great i dont know if youve dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business but you have good core business momentum and a pipeline of won but not yet funded so i guess the question is where can services be over lets say the next two years in terms of growth while rates come down yet your businesses is winning new wins mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure you want me to sure jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah and ill jump in too lets maybe start with tts when we think about the performance of tts which as we say the growth this year up exargentina came from a combination of both rates and the strong citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 business actions weve taken and you can see that in the different drivers crossborder was up commercial cards up in terms of the growth prospects weve generated in average revenue growth from to well ahead of the investor day guidance we had of highsingle digit that was not just because of the rate cycle it obviously helped and we certainly expect to grow revenues at midsingle digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases and thats going to come from a few different areas one the focus on our fee strategy where were capitalizing on strong client engagement marketleading client solutions and were delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that weve been investing in across all our client segments well continue optimizing our deposit box and bringing in highquality deposits and in a lower rate environment gdp is typically higher so youd expect to see some higher growth in our capitalefficient payment volumes youll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients and id point to our confidence here increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained winloss ratio of on new deals and that was across different client segments and revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them and youll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms weve been doing launching new innovative products and were seeing momentum from some of the things weve done citi token services payment express sic express payments clearing et cetera so i think the main takeaway from tts is that well continue to invest in it we expect to see strong client momentum weve been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities so we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down and it is a crown jewel for a reason and then just quickly on securities services i think where were seeing we mentioned weve got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments that pipeline is both investors and issuers and one of the core strategies that was okan put in place was to grow share with the usbased asset managers we were at share in were now at and a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming not only from our global network names but also from the marquee players in the us asset manager space i think thats our ability to connect our capabilities that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients mark anything ive missed there mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i dont think jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc you know i love this business mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc as you should rightfully so highreturning business great growth prospects to answer one of your questions glenn about half of the nii growth we could attribute to interest rates and about half id say is business action citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 so us working with the clients to drive that momentum and then if you think about the noninterest revenue for services theyre up about in the quarter yearoveryear if you exclude the impact of the argentina devaluation and up on a full year basis and so good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is now open john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc morning john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research mark was hoping to ask you how are you thinking about the pacing of capital build obviously the basel iii proposals are out there but they could change of course even if they dont change you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phaseins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities how should we think about you kind of building capital given all those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure so look john obviously the basel iii proposals still out there and under discussion weve been very vocal about the potential impact of that weve also been very disciplined about how weve been managing our capital weve built that over basis points over the course of the year youve seen us actively manage that through the year and were going to continue to do that we obviously generate earnings that contribute to that we want to continue to drive growth across the business were trading at a times book where we can we want to buy back as much as we can in shares and we try to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters doing that as a modest level you heard me say were going to do that again this quarter at a modest level but we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like and were actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sits so its an ongoing active management that tries to balance servicing our client needs with obviously holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty thats out there and with an eye towards buybacks where we can do that john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and just as an expense followup i wasnt clear has the transformation spend peaked when you think about what youll spend on transformation this year versus last year and are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so to be clear were going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls and so we did see a tick up this year weve got a plan for and if weve got to spend a bit more than we spent this year were going to spend more thats what the plan calls for and so thats what well do thats inside of the number that ive given you for guidance all right and so thats important for us i think it will drive obviously operational improvement and saves down the line it is part of the billion to billion but that is the early stage if you will of the transformation spend paying back i think as we talked about at investor day frankly well continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that weve been making and so i would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that well see from the investments weve been making in transformation and risk and controls jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i think mark youre spot on so well continue making the investments we need to in the transformation its a multiyear journey as weve always been clear around this ultimately with benefits to the shareholders and more of the expense saves that weve been talking about are id separate out transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses which we want to make sure is as productive and as effective as possible and the types of benefits were seeing this is the second year in a row that weve retired of our legacy platform base and youve heard me talking about moving of our cash equity platforms on to reporting ledgers on to sanctioned platforms on to so we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in other things we automated independent price verification for of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities thats reduced manual controls thats improved valuation consistency thats also had an impact on the efficiency of the business weve loaded of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories that will also begin to start having some benefits for us so there is a cumulative effect that is beginning to build now from all the work weve done but it will take some time to really kick into the as mark said when you really feel it is a few years out but well keep giving you the proof points of things as were going so its not a just trust us that is coming youll begin to see it build operator our next question will come from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is now open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good afternoon mark maybe just to follow up on the expense slide where you talk about billion to billion of expense saves i guess im struggling with the numbers there i think if you look at exit and wind down markets youre probably close to billion in numbers there and maybe the stranded costs you cant get all of that out youre doing about severance is million to billion in so doesnt seem like theres a ton of actual cost saves in that number and just maybe im wrong if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if theres youve kind of eluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think the thing id point out to you is a couple things one obviously were forecasting revenue growth over this period of time and so theres going to be volumerelated expenses associated with that the second thing id point out as i just mentioned to the prior question is that were continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time and so what you see is theres an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things and thats offset by the savings that were starting to generate particularly from the org simplification that jane has talked about as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that weve referenced in some of the prepared remarks and so important to think about there are headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this billion to billion and then the final point that id make is if i look at this mediumterm number of billion to billion that still has mexico in it and one of the other pages wed point to expenses around mexico but because of where we are well be in the ipo process thats still going to be part of this expense base and so you cant lose sight of that jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc well thats an important clarification that the billion to billion includes revenuerelated volume growth so thats helpful and then just maybe the other on the slides talking about revenue targets one of the big numbers not talked about was markets how are you thinking volatility has come in macro pictures getting better maybe thats volatility how do you think about that business in as it relates to your guidance mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc as you know its a tough business to forecast certainly for a full year and in some instances for a quarter and so weve basically kind of backed that out but we assume markets kind of flat to modestly down but weve backed it out and its roughly flat not of the billion to billion right you see the guidance of nir ex markets and nii exmarkets so in the billion to billion weve assumed it roughly flat jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thank you operator our next question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc morning afternoon jane just wanted to follow up on something i think mark said at the end of his very first response around its very hard in my seat to figure out whether youre going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro should we take it based on what youve said today as we look into getting to that rotce if for whatever reason revenue falls short and you feel good about the expense mix to mitigate that headwind jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc its jane obviously i want to just jump in on one bit which is we are committed and were very confident around the to revenue growth rate so there isnt any backing away from that number and thats in various macro environments et cetera and as we look across the different businesses and the projections we have were confident around that obviously if theres a very adverse macro environment et cetera weve got other levers we can take but mark let me pass it to you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and by no means was i trying to suggest that we werent confident in the forecast for the top line if you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses weve got a lot of conviction around that with that said as you point out jane under a circumstance where that doesnt play out there are obviously volume related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down wed ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall and then wed recalibrate other spend other investments spend not related to risk and controls and transformation but other investments across the platform wed recalibrate accordingly ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well said just what i needed and one quick question as we think about rightsizing the markets business there have been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that youve gotten out is there a risk where the markets business becomes too small and you lag the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain or just across the breadth of be it fixed income or equities just if you can talk about that thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc the short answer is no if you think about our markets business we have four businesses each of which are around sort of billion or so in size you have our global fx network where were typically number one in any year just given the strength and particularly the corporate client base weve set off weight typically top three together these are two of the largest macro pools within ficc in terms of the spread products weve been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification fully within markets so that weve created a unified scaled spreads product business and then finally equities where were focused on improving our prime offering building balances we still have a way to go obviously in that prime balances were pleased they were nicely up this year driven by client momentum and were a leading equities derivative franchise so you do have these four core businesses and id go back to our big point of differentiation and why we feel were wellpositioned we have a very differentiated corporate client base and very strong partnerships between our core markets franchise tts and citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 banking and securities services and that helps us in fx in commodities and in rates around the world so markets is important both in terms of its leadership but also how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simplicity of those five core interconnected businesses weve demonstrated solid returns in the past i think a lot of the actions weve been taking will help drive returns in the future and you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline were putting on to rwa getting close that target we said at investor day were moving that up to the exits weve got of nonstrategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency and weve also been doing some good investments in our technology and thats getting us into a good place there so i think dont be concerned about the shrinking were just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns operator our next question will come from gerald cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good afternoon mark jane mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc afternoon jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark can you share with us in your revenue guide in the net interest income i know you mentioned its going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast which includes the fed in our country six cuts can you give us some color what kind of rate environment i know you said lower rates but any insights around that guide mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think what id point you to is in the range of the billion to billion were assuming three to six cuts right youve got a range there and the reason i described it like that is that if you think about our ire as weve shown it in the qs before were positioned such that with basis point move parallel shift in rate across the curve the us dollar impact would only be a couple hundred million dollars all right and so to the negative obviously but its a couple hundred million dollars and so as we think about that forecast and as i mentioned nii being down a bit that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of likely backloaded but thats whats in there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate that and then jane more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative but obviously theres numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on exiting businesses downsizing citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 businesses especially on the downsizing i think you guys mentioned the head count of about coming down how do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes well weve also got areas which are growing so that does help too we have a diversified portfolio here i think were very mindful of that there is a human impact of the decisions that were making were trying to be as transparent with our people as we are with our investors about what we need to do why were doing it what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decision and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can i think thats the most humane way to do this operator our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi im sorry to prolong the call thank you for all your color just one more question jane when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook thats beyond just fourth quarter i know you still have a little bit of ways to go but you do have basis point buffer to your minimum and i know basel iii endgame is still out there and im sure that reducing risk just doesnt mean expenses but also reducing your or being mindful of your rwa footprint and given where your stock is relative to book when will you be more comfortable about giving sort of a longerterm outlook that was underpinning your rotce target with regards to the buyback jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc erika its a great question its one i ask myself every morning when i get up because given where we trade the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous and mark and i are very committed to doing so we also know that were building our credibility and i dont want to say things that were not going to deliver against although were going to have to change i think its one of the values that were really trying to adhere to very strongly and with the npl i think well get a better sense about this soon the comment period just got extended and we want to see what that is i think youve all heard us at the senate banking hearings with our concerns about it i very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially so it doesnt have a negative impact on the economy and the us banking system competitiveness more business the shadow banks which i think has got to a point which is not healthy so were going to wait and see where that comes out before we give it to you but i would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you jane i think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where youre trying to build credibility because as i think about what longonly investors have been dying to see from citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness and i think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors so thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you operator our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi i want to follow up on the russian exposure on page it looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the net investments and you also highlighted how the cta would be capitalneutral even if you did have to write that down but what about the remaining exposure and just like how prime are you responsible for some of these unremittable corporate derivatives i think a lot of us dont understand that type of exposure and is there risk to you going forward or could you hopefully clear it back from the outside exposure going forward jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah actually i also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before i turn it to mark because i would have thought thats a question that is on everybodys minds particularly given the firms overall low level of returns and our headline numbers this quarter about what weve been doing with russia and argentina the sort of bigger strategic question behind it and then well get to your specifics on the russia front if you think about citi we have a differentiated global business model and that means were committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run so that means we hold longterm capital in those countries upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle and let me just point to our leading services and fx businesses are the heart of that network and theyre generating doubledigits as you can see with that thought comes a set of risks so i think of it in terms of credit currency transferability of capital and weve proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time and with respect to the q4 currency and transfer items while the timing was unknown and weve highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years id say russia is rather unique its a war and for us a highly unusual liquidation weve navigated it very well weve executed our winddown in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us our remaining net assets are now reserved again and i think similarly if i just touch on argentina for a minute because im sure those have got a few questions on that similarly over the last several years weve derisked our business model there we dont have a consumer bank so weve really reduced down our emerging markets exposures to just our institutional presence focused on the multinational clients youve heard us talk about that and select highgrade local clients if you look at argentina its a very good business for us over the cycle and even after the impacts of q4 we had less than million in credit losses in argentina over a 10year period thats remarkable million over years in terms of the currency risk we all have to book revenues the official rate versus the parallel market rate we are able to partially but not fully hedge the exposure but we would certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls and the reserve is a reserve it centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per us banking would so i just want to put part of things at this quarter into that context citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 we have a global business model its heavily focused on highgrade multinational clients our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong and i think youre seeing us with a very conservative and reserved profile mark what would you add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah very quickly on the russia point as you know and as the slide points out weve continued to bring our exposure down there its down to billion its down from the previous year and athird from weve brought down the consumer loans the consumer deposits in a significant way there and essentially whats left is that we have a custody business and were holding corporate dividends that are our clients proceeds were unable to pay those out by law by regulation and so we have to hold those and so thats whats being referenced in the slide when we say unremittable russia corporate dividends and so that is not a risk of loss for us but were unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in russia at this stage matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay that was clear and then just separately in credit cards you and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here but most of you are saying theyre going to peak at this year including you just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year if youre just getting back to that a little bit of a normalized level is it some tightening that youve done whats driving that confidence looking out this year because youre probably seeing a stepup coming still right mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure theres a stepup coming we give a forecast on as you point out to what the fullyear estimate for ncls will be for both branded and for retail services what id point out is you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the covid period and so to some extent what were seeing is kind of a catch up of those as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what youd normally see in a cards portfolio on top of that weve been originating new card youve noticed our acquisitions have grown so we obviously have new card loans and those are going through a much normal maturation period and so as we look at the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out weve got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level and we think theyll peak inside of so thats captured in that average forecast that weve given we havent made material changes to our underwriting however there is mix evolution that happens transactors we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix of our branded portfolio as well so anyway those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that were talking about here operator operator instructions our next question will come from ryan kenny with morgan stanley your line is now open ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 hi thanks for taking my question so i have a question on quantitative tightening wondering if you have any early thoughts on how citis positioned if the fed ends q2 early is that a material catalyst for you and would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah again i mean when i think about our interest rate exposure and for us dollar in particular we showed it in our last q well show it in this q for a basis point move in a parallel shift were looking at probably a negative billion or so but important to point out that the us dollar component of that is only a couple hundred million dollars similarly if rates moved in the other way positive of basis points thered be a small movement as it relates to us dollar exposure so our us dollar exposure is relatively neutral again assuming a static balance sheet a parallel shift in the curve and so were kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and therefore the impact there ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc then theres a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound are you seeing that and can you help us update us on investment banking pipeline across ma ecm dcm jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes we certainly had a much more constructive market environment to the end of interest rate spreads and volatility at lows for the year equity prices are high and i think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in assuming the tailwinds persist and speaking of our own pipeline the breadth the depth the quality of its very sound its higher than it was precovid so when markets are constructive we expect to move these opportunities forward and were hearing a lot more confidence from the ceos cfos around this and yeah were looking at our own side as you know weve been investing in some highergrowth areas so we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as highgrowth areas and weve been seeing some very good momentum in healthcare and technology as well as areas of traditional strength which is energy and industrial and i think we feel very confident in the recovery in dcm the beginnings of indiscernible and so cautiously optimistic here so i wouldnt say that its going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed but i think were feeling much better about the foundation mark anything youd add mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i completely agree jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon everybody thanks for taking the questions have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force and i guess just broadly how might that be embedded in the revenue guidance and i guess just at a top level maybe just a shot or two on jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sorry scott i didnt hear what it was i think the phone line cut out the revenue attrition r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes im sorry yeah just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction in force over the coming year jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc okay r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah how thats embedded in the jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc no no no we havent i think a lot of the moves that weve made from the organization simplification so the or so roles we talked about theyre mainly managerial roles and theyve mainly impacted the functions and the geographies not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators and the other piece is with the client organization were actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward so i think what were looking at here is getting rid of areas of bureaucracy and where weve been too complicated where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenueproductive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client so i like to see the opposite actually r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then mark can you discuss for a second maybe just broadly the flow of expenses through the year i know that they should begin to decline towards the end but what happens between now and then do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate or would there be any normal course of business growth mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i think what id say is that you should expect it in the first quarter wed likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth in part because as jane has mentioned we anticipate that therell be more to the org citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 simplification and therefore dollars associated with that in q1 and then from there i would expect that you see a downward trend through the fourth quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes operator operator instructions our next question will come from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jane hi mark jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc couple of quick clarifications on your nii guide you talked about youre assuming three to six cuts thats us i presume so are you assuming flat unchanged rates outside the us since you have more sensitivity outside mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc modest declines outside but yes declines outside as well but not nearly of the magnitude of what were talking about in the us vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then jane to your point about the head count cuts and i heard you just mentioned from managerial positions where are the rest coming there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so let me just be clear about where the ones that weve just done and that were working on through the organization simplification so when i think about that effort it will close at the end of the first quarter as we said were expecting to get about billion of run rate save from the org simplification work alone that constitutes about heads were just about to at the end of this month finish phase which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed thats seen a net reduction of about managers out of a total of roles theres about and these are mainly manager roles as i talked about earlier citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 then when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this as mark was talking about earlier the stranded costs well be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestitures well be continuing and youve seen us been continuing that exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that weve got some businesses where we feel we need to rightsize the core expense base andy sieg is going to be kicking off that in wealth and youll begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter hes off to a strong start and then weve got others where well be creating more utilities weve still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification has highlighted well be aggregating those creating utilities or are consolidating some of those different functions and that is before we get to beginning to get benefits from the transformation where therell be efficiencies that come through well still have areas that were investing these are going to be as we talked about core business investments its going to be expense growth still in the top from volume growth that weve got and we will be investing in our transformation and all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the to rotce target we talked about so that its the number that we estimate of the head count i dont love thinking head count i like thinking about expenses i think its a more meaningful number so as mark laid out in his presentation weve got a net expense save that were expecting to achieve from the medium term and these are the raft of different areas that will be contributing to it and were working hard at it operator our next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi thanks for taking my questions really kind of just tickytack modeling questions on the revenue side does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees and how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at citi europe mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so lets see so obviously the proposals out there and weve factored in whats knowable as it relates to that we havent given guidance externally on what that impact is but we do believe there are offsets and mitigants that over time well be able to kind of bring into play and so a longwinded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late fee adjustment steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just on the earlier comments you made mark around services nii i am struggling to reconcile the nii contribution from rate and volume components just given average loan to deposits were essentially flat yearonyear nii grew billion it does imply a much larger contribution from rates i know theres deposit funds transfer pricing and other noise so i was hoping maybe you could unpack that a little bit further mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q4 earnings call 12jan2024 i mean there are a lot of factors in there theres obviously as well the mix as it relates to what we have in the us versus outside of the us so there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here but were happy to kind of follow up with you offline and take you through it operator our final question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah just a clarification when you said medium term on this call as it relates to employee reductions expense savings revenue targets and to roughly does medium term mean by or does it mean something different mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah its jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc by mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mike operator there are no further questions i will turn the call over to jenn landis for
