quarter we achieved success in a number of areas underscoring the benefits of our diversity and dedication of our team to deliver responsible growth our organic growth continues to add customers and activity to all our businesses even as we see the trough in net interest income this quarter im starting on slide our net income for the quarter was billion after tax or in diluted eps attesting to the balance in our franchise the earnings were split evenly half in our consumer gwim businesses which serve people and the other half in our institutional focus business global banking and markets we grew revenue from the second quarter as improvement in noninterest income overcame the decline in net interest income fees grew yearoveryear and represented of total revenue in the quarter our strong fee performance was led by a improvement in asset management fees and our wealth management businesses we grew investment banking fees yearoveryear and saw sales in trading revenue increase global markets had its ninth consecutive quarter of the yearoveryear growth in sales and trading revenue a good job by jimmy demare and a team card and service charge revenue also grew by yearoveryear in our consumer business much of this fee growth is the result of our intensity around organic growth and is a testament to the diversity of our operating model now on to slide organic growth has been driven by several key factors first we focus on our customers we continue to place them at the center of everything we do consumerled the way in delivering solid organic growth with highquality accounts and engaged clients for the consecutive quarter we had significant net new consumer checking accounts we expanded our customer base and our market share specifically we added net new checking accounts

now using zelle they sent money on zelle at nearly two and a half times the rate they write checks and in fact more zelle transactions sent transactions take place than combination of customer atm

of the year and renovate another this investment in both our expansion markets and our growth markets in wealth management we continue to invest in our advisor development program its grown to

customer segment but importantly we also invest across our lines of business to knit them together and gain market share in the local markets bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 its a differentiated advantage for us our banking leadership position across our businesses and our nationwide franchise for example we leverage our franchise by connecting business customers wealth management teams our teams across all our businesses have made million referrals to other businesses in the first six months of this year next we drive efficiency and effectiveness and thats through our operational excellence platform we continue to invest heavily in the future of our franchise and growth while we also have to manage expenses daytoday our focus on operational excellence has enabled us to hold our expense growth up to yearoveryear well below the inflation rates we continue to work to achieve operating leverage as nii stabilizes and begins to grow again as you look at it and alastair will explain later a fair portion of the yearoveryear increase in expense is due to formulaic incentives of wealth management due to the fee growth in that business and last our capital strength allows us to deliver for all our stakeholders our capital remains strong as we held our cet1 ratio at this quarter we grew loans increased our share repurchases to billion and paid billion in dividends average diluted shares dropped below billion shares outstanding in addition we also announced our intent to increase our quarterly dividend upon board approval note that cet1 ratio remained a solid excess capital position of both of other current regulatory requirements and the increased requirement to beginning in october as a result of recent ccar exam lets turn to slide a couple things to note here first weve noted for several quarters that the second quarter nii would be the trough for this rate cycle we expect nii to grow in the third quarter and fourth quarter this year alastair is going to provide you some points in detail about the path forward one of the important contributors to that change is the positive behaviors of our customers on slide youll note that average deposits grew yearoveryear and increased modestly linked quarter the second quarter in reality is typically a heavy outflow quarter we have a lot of customers who pay a lot of taxes in that quarter quarteroverquarter increases in rates paid continue to slow again this quarter across all businesses except for wealth management and we show you that on this page slide by line of business while wealth business deposit rates moved higher with continued rotation we expect those rates to begin to stabilize and the rate of quarterly change decrease going forward turning to slide in previous calls many of youve asked questions or commented upon the question about consumer net chargeoffs and when would they stabilize in the second half of that expectation we have remains unchanged as well this quarters net chargeoffs were basis points for context this is stabilization of the rate i will just remind you that prior to this quarter i have to go all the way back to to see a chargeoff rate of that high and thats near when we were still emerging from the financial crisis on slide we highlight the and day plus credit card delinquency trends which show delinquencies have plateaued for the second consecutive quarter this should lead to stabilized net credit losses in credit card in the second half of the year at the bottom of the page note a couple of facts first on a payment rates this is the rate of pay down of balances in a given month remain above index to the prepandemic levels even while our card customers have plenty of capacity to borrow and importantly because of our relationshipbased businesses look at the right hand slide of the bottom of page five there you can see our deposit investment balances of our customers who also have a card with us remain above their prepandemic levels illustrating continue to help these customers so as you think about consumer credit the card chargeoffs drive it in a flattened out in terms of delinquencies and we expect them to improve in the second half bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 with regard to commercial real estate our usual cre credit exposure slide is included in our appendix we continue to aggressively work through our loans in our modest cre office portfolio we saw a decrease in all the categories decrease in reservable criticized loans a decrease in npls and a decrease in net chargeoffs this supports our previous expectation that net chargeoffs in the second half of will be lower than the first half of our second quarter performance highlights bank of americas ability to generate strong sustainable growth through a combination of customer centric strategies innovation strategic investments and a commitment to strong balance of risk and reward we call that responsible growth were confident that focused approach will continue to drive longterm success and create value for you our shareholders now i will turn it to alastair for additional results alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and im going to start on slide of the earnings presentation ill touch on more highlights noted on slide as we work through the material i just wanted to say upfront that we delivered strong returns with return on average assets of basis points and a return on tangible common equity of nearly so lets move to the balance sheet on slide where you can see we ended the quarter at trillion of total assets relatively unchanged from the first quarter and not much to note here apart from a mix shift of lower securities balances mostly offset by an increase in reverse repo and modest loan growth as well as global markets client activity on the funding side deposits declined billion on an ending basis reflecting typical seasonal customer payments of income taxes and as brian noted average deposits were still modestly higher liquidity remains strong with billion of global liquidity sources that was flat compared to the first quarter shareholders equity was also flat compared to q1 as earnings were offset by billion in capital distributed to shareholders and a billion redemption of preferred stock in the quarter the billion of capital contributions included billion in common dividends and the repurchase of billion in shares aoci improved modestly in the quarter and tangible book value per share of rose from the second quarter of last year in terms of regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion and the cet1 ratio was stable at this ratio remained well above our current requirement as well as our new requirement as of october riskweighted assets increased modestly and that was driven by lending activity our supplemental leverage ratio was versus our minimum requirement of and that leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our billion of tlac means our total loss absorbing capital ratio remains comfortably above our requirements brian already covered deposit trends so lets turn the balance sheet focus to loans and well look at average balances on slide you can see average loans in q2 of trillion they improved yearoveryear driven by credit card growth and modest commercial growth the modest improvement in overall commercial loans included a increase in our domestic commercial loans and leases partially offset by a decline in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 commercial real estate middle market lending saw an uptick in the quarter and we saw good demand in our wealth businesses from customer lending these areas of growth were largely offset by continued paydowns from our larger corporate clients on interest rate sentiment consumer growth was driven by credit card borrowing and while home lending balances were flattish originations picked up a bit this quarter lastly and on a positive note loan spreads continued to widen as we turn our focus then to nii performance and slide note that we move the slide we typically used to talk about excess deposits to the appendix on slide so you can see that there our excess deposit levels above loans remained high at billion and continued to be a good source of value for shareholders of our excess liquidity is now in shortdated cash and available for sale securities the longerdated lower yielding holdtomaturity book continues to rolloff and we reinvested again this quarter in higher yielding assets the blended yield of cash and securities continue to improve in the quarter and is now basis points above our deposit rate paid regarding nii on a gaap technical difficulty operator to all locations on hold please remain online were experiencing a technical difficulty please remain online youll hear music for just a moment alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp will materialize and this now includes three interest rate cuts starting in september another in november and one more in december and the waterfall shows an estimated impact of those rate cuts to our quarterly nii the next couple of categories are a result of natural management interest rate risk in a balance sheet mix with fixed rate assets and variable rate assets and our balance sheet is split roughly half in half so we take in liquidity from customers that we use to fund our assets and then we store excess liquidity in cash and securities we have fixed assets that mature and pay down and those supply cash that then gets put back to work on the balance sheet and reprices over time and we have two basic categories of fixed assets that mature and pay off and those are securities and loans on securities you can see weve got about billion a quarter of cash coming off of our securities portfolio and again roughly basis points of improvement on those assets when we put that money back from the balance sheet on loans between resi mortgage and auto weve got another roughly billion which reprices with a little less yield improvement and little securities and between the securities and loans we expect the fixed rate asset repricing adds about million to our quarterly rate of nii as we get to the fourth quarter on the variable rate asset side and to protect from down moves in rates we hedged some of that with cash flow swaps and those typically rolloff in any given quarter and get replaced over time so included in the cash flow hedges is an impact of cessation of bsby as an alternative rate if you recall we took a charge in the fourth quarter of it was billion and we said that would come back to us through time and beginning in november we start to see the benefit coming back into nii and in q4 thats about million bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 that q4 partial quarter benefit will grow by slightly smaller sequential nii benefit in q1 and then it begins to taper off heading into in addition weve got about billion of receive fixed cash flow hedges protecting us from short rate moves moving over most are hedging floating rate commercial loans and the cost of those hedges is reported as contra revenue in commercial loan interest income these hedges have a weightedaverage life of just over two years and theyve got an average fixed rate of approximately basis points so starting in the second half of we begin to get some additional nii tailwind because the cash flow hedges with lower fixed rate likes where we receive those will begin to rolloff and will likely replace those at higher current market rates at the time the actual size of the tailwind will get from the expiration of those swaps will obviously be highly dependent on the level and the shape of the yield curve at the time of those maturities and that stretches out over the course of the next four years okay a couple other points to make youll note we dont expect much movement around our modestly liability sensitive global markets nii activity and lastly our forward view has an expectation of low singledigit growth in loans low singledigit growth in deposits with continued slowing of rate paid movement through the back half of and you can see our expectation of the combined impact here as well this last element is the one that has the most potential variability and obviously it will depend upon actual deposit and loan growth and pricing and rotation okay lets turn to expense and well use slide for the discussion we reported billion of expense this quarter and thats more than million lower than q1 which included million for the fdic special assessment not including the fdic assessment expenses were lower than q1 by million driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense compared to q2 were up less than and that increase is equal to the incentives paid for improved fee revenue incentives for gwim business alone are up million yearoveryear and thats obviously an expense were happy to pay when we have a improvement in fees for assets under management our second quarter head count number included welcoming a diverse class of nearly summer interns we hope will join us over the course of the next year or two upon their graduation and absent those interns our head count fell by nearly in the third quarter we expect to add approximately college graduates for full time more than and thats from more than applications received showing that we remain an employer of choice for talented young people expense levels for the rest of are expected to bounce around the second quarter level given the higher fee revenue and investments made for growth so lets now move to credit and well turn to slide there was little change in our asset quality metrics this quarter provision expense was billion that was million higher than q1 driven by a smaller reserve for lease in q2 net chargeoffs of billion were little changed with a small increase in credit card mostly offset by lower commercial real estate office chargeoffs on a weighted basis we remain reserved for unemployment rate of nearly by the end of compared to the most recent rate reported the net chargeoff ratio was basis points largely unchanged from q1 on slide we highlight more credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios consumer net chargeoffs increased by a modest million versus the first quarter from the flow through of higher late stage credit card delinquencies from q1 highlighting the change in direction of delinquencies consumer day plus delinquencies declined in by million bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 commercial net chargeoffs were relatively flat as lower commercial real estate losses were mostly offset by a small increase in other commercial loans our office losses went from million in q1 to million in q2 other commercial real estate loan losses were simply one indiscernible okay lets move to the various lines of business and some brief comments on their results and ill start on slide with consumer banking for the quarter consumer earned billion on continued strong organic growth and reported earnings declined yearoveryear as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to the second quarter of last year customer activity showed another strong quarter net new checking growth another strong period of card openings and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed yearoveryear through a new record billion that included months of strong flows at billion in addition to market appreciation over the time as noted earlier loans grew nicely yearoveryear from credit card as well as small business where we remain the industry leader the team held expense flat yearoveryear reflecting good work with continued business investments for growth offset by the operational excellence work to improve processes and move more of our transactions to digital and as you can see on the appendix page digital adoption and engagement continued to improve and customer satisfaction scores remain near record levels illustrating customer appreciation of our enhanced capabilities due to our continuous investment moving to wealth management on slide we produced good results and those included good organic client activity market favorability and strong aum flows and this quarter also saw good lending results our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services coupled with our commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients net income rose from the second quarter of last year to a little more than billion in q2 we reported revenue of billion growing over the prior year as brian noted strong growth in fee revenue from investment and brokerage services overcame the nii headwind expense growth reflects the fee growth and other investments for future the business had a margin and it generated a stronger turn on capital of more than average loans were up yearoveryear driven by strong growth were seeing in custom lending and a pickup in mortgage lending both merrill and the private bank continued to see good organic growth and they produced strong assets under management flows of billion since last years second quarter which reflects a mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting more of their money to work i also want to highlight the continued digital momentum in this business and you can find that on slide on slide we turn to global banking results and here the business produced earnings of billion down yearoveryear as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense revenue declined driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation a diversified revenue across products and regions reflects the strength of our global banking franchise in our gts business fees for managing the cash of clients offsets a lot of the nii pressure from higher rates and clients are accessing the capital markets for their capital needs instead of borrowing investment banking had a strong quarter growing fees yearoveryear to nearly billion led by debt capital markets fees mostly in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 leverage finance and investment grade and we finished the quarter strong maintaining our number three investment banking fee position globally a solid start to has left us in a good position with top three rankings now in north america latin america and emea and number six in apac and were seeing strong performance in important industry groups as well an increase in provision expense from last year was driven by the commercial real estate net chargeoffs i discussed earlier and expense increased yearoveryear including continued investment in the business switching to global markets on slide ill focus my comments on results excluding dva as i normally do the team had another terrific quarter as we generated good revenue growth and achieved operating leverage and continued to deliver a solid return on capital earnings of billion grew yearoveryear and return on average allocated capital was revenue and again this is exdva improved from the second quarter of focusing on sales and trading exdva revenue improved yearoveryear to billion and thats the highest second quarter in over a decade ficc was down while equities increased compared to q2 ficc revenues remain strong and versus q2 they were modestly lower driven by a weaker macro trading quarter in fx and rates and that was largely offset by better commodities and mortgage trading equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives and cash equities yearoveryear expenses were up on revenue improvement and continued investment in the business finally on slide all other shows a loss of billion and that was little changed yearoveryear as lower expense was offset by lower provision costs as a result of reserve changes our effective tax rate for the quarter was and excluding discrete items and the tax credits related to investments in renewable energy and affordable housing the effective tax rate would have been and with that i think well stop there and well jump into questions lee mcentire senior vice presidentinvestor relations bank of america corp all right alastair brian i just wanted to i did hear some feedback that maybe the audio from the call got interrupted for a moment so at the point of which it got interrupted i just want to reiterate a couple of points that alastair was making if you go back to slide where i think we lost the audio was where we started beginning discussion about the performance from q1 to q2 of net interest income that was driven by higher funding cost and the rotation of deposits seeking higher yield alternatives and while higher again in q2 both the rotation and the rate pay increases did continue to slow down on the slide i think the only points that i would make that alastair began to discuss there was we are just reiterating our expectation that quarter two would be the bottom for the nii in the rate cycle that we have been in and our trajectory remains the same the belief that our nii will begin to rise in q3 compared to q2 and then rise again in q4 we provided the range of expectations that alastair covered and we expect q4 nii to be around the billion level plus or minus that would be approximately to higher than this quarters nii and he began that bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 discussion by making sure that you know that we pickup an extra day of net interest income in the q3 providing about million of additional nii that also carries through into q4 you see that on the slide it also assumes that the current forward curve will materialize that said that interest rate cuts will start in september we will expect another one in november and december in the curve and the waterfall includes an estimated impact of those rates to quarterly net interest income and so then we started a discussion he began the discussion on the fixed asset repricing which then i think is where the audio picked back up again and so were happy to answer some questions on that i know youll have questions but just wanted to recover those points for you question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr of evercore brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much hello there and definitely appreciate slide a lot i know you would have given us a nii guide if you wanted to give us one so feel free to give that if you want but thats not my question my question is given all the pieces of the puzzle that you gave us expectations for modest loan to deposit growth and slowing deposit seeking behavior if you get that pickup from to this year that youre expecting right now or at least recently consensus had nii looking flattish with that fourth quarter number and that doesnt make a lot of sense given all the pieces so maybe if you can just comment directionally if you dont want to give the number of does it make sense to you that we collectively be expecting flat nii with your higher fourth quarter number alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so glenn youre right were probably not going to give guidance around for all the reasons that you would expect what were trying to do here is reinforce for everyone what weve been saying from the beginning of the year and as we think q2 is the trough and we believe from this point were in a good position to grow now when you look at some of the elements of this bridge youll draw your own conclusions with respect to fixed rate asset pricing is going to persist for some period of time and youll be able to draw your own conclusions but i just want to point out weve been pretty clear on our guidance for q1 and q2 weve always felt like this would be the trough we feel like q3 and q4 are likely to be better you can see our work here weve laid it all out nothings really changed in terms of that and the most important thing i think for everybody here is we feel like is a really foundational year its this twist period where we just got to get through the last of the deposit rotation and were establishing a foundation for growth from here so thats what were trying to convey bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi maybe i could just ask a followup on deposits within the wealth business you have trillion of client assets im curious if you can break out the split between brokerage and advisory accounts can you hear me okay im hearing tons of feedback brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi sorry okay sorry okay so trillion in client assets brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we can hear you glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi great trillion in client assets in wealth im curious if you can give us the split between brokerage and advisory and the reason im asking is im curious how youve been handling rate paid on cash and advisory accounts and whether we should expect any behavioral changes following the recent wealth news thanks a lot sorry for the feedback alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp look glenn im not sure that distinction would be the distinction id look to weve gone through a massive change in cash infused in the economy and were drawing out under monetary policy and so as we stabilize our instructions to our team are to grow our deposit base a little bit faster than economy and that means you have to price across the board to achieve that and if you look at the slide or where i showed you sort of the change what you see is the wealth management business takes a little bit longer because those clients have more investment cash with us not what youre thinking investment cash is in their money how they think about cash they dont need for daily cash flow then they move that around that largely is over and if you look in the last four to six weeks were seeing those deposits of that business bounce around to 280oddbillion level not a lot of movement and itll keep moving in and out depending on customers paying down paying their income taxes taking more risk in the market and all those things but the deposit pricing changes that we made to ensure that they had a platform they could grow having been as high as billion down to billion were made in the quarter and all through the pl glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay audio gap on advisory thanks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp next question operator operator well take our next question from jim mitchell of seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a quick followup and i dont mean to beat a dead horse on nii but can you just help us think through the puts and takes on you have rate cuts at the end of the year forward curve implies more next year is that cumulative impact starts to hit next year i guess what gives you confidence that this is sort of a trough what are all of the puts and takes that we should think about and how we model the nii for next year when we think about the forward curve and that impact alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp jim i think this bridge probably is all the right inputs for any given year i mean weve chosen to do it for weve always resisted going out too far for the very simple reason that so many variables and they start to multiply with one another if you think about even the rate cut one here were using the three cuts september november december if i do this as of wednesday of last week there would have been two earlier in the year there were six so since we dont know what that path looks like its very challenging then to provide guidance for at this stage but what were laying out here is these are the component parts were going to get some benefit from fixed rate asset pricing over time were going to get some benefit from the immediate term from the bsby cessation and thats leading back into the pl as that rolls off well get benefit from cash flow hedges repricing and then we use the forward curve the same as you do for the rate cuts we benefit a little bit from global markets liability sensitivity and then that final piece is the piece that were trying to drive in terms of organic growth were trying to drive this loan growth trying to drive the deposit growth and as brian pointed out its been a pretty unusual period in history where weve had an enormous change in the rate structure and in the fiscal stimulus and the effects now fading away to something more normal but that last box will come down to your assumptions versus our assumptions and we will update you as we go through the next couple quarters and well give you a better sense towards the end of the year jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats all fair and maybe just on the growth piece maybe deposits seem to have bottomed for you guys in the second quarter of last year youve had new growth i think brian pointed out even with the tax headwind this quarter you grew sequentially so good performance but still pretty modest how are you thinking about the growth trajectory from here i guess as we think about is it does it accelerate with rate cuts in your view what are the dynamics youre thinking about thats really returning to the historical kind of midsingledigit deposit growth within bofa and the industry bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think brian covered slide that top left chart gives a sense for whats going on with the growth thats average growth over time there weve had four quarters in a row so feel good about that part q2 does tend to be a slower quarter just with all the tax payments so we think deposits will do better over time particularly as we get past peak fed funds we feel like the pricing and rotation you can sort of see it in our numbers theyre slowing so were getting towards the end there were getting towards the end of q3 so were not quite finished on all of those things yet id be careful about getting too excited about deposit growth but we feel like were doing okay so far and we just got to keep driving that jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator well take our next question from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi ill start with a simple question you mentioned loan spreads have improved why is that where is that do you expect that to continue alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp loan spreads have improved for us mike over the course of the past i think its now eight or nine quarters its primarily in the commercial businesses and its largely because we have to price the balance sheet for the returns that our shareholders expect and thats true i think for the industry weve been quite purposeful in that regard so weve tried to balance price spread and growth over the course of time but its primarily in commercial phenomenon at this point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and i would expect that to continue for the foreseeable future but its a competitive environment weve got to see mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay you gave us slide a lot of details there you talked about the september rate cuts the fixed asset repricing securities repricing loans repricing mortgage and auto swaps maturing november we see fixed cash swaps a whole litany of stuff but i think when you put it all together what its led to is a net internet margin of only in fact i think your yield on your assets is below fed funds right now so would you agree that youre under earning with that nim of and i know ive asked this question before but you always have to markto bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 market what is a normal nim i mean you were in you were in and i know the composition changed and everything but whats normal nim and what do you think is a normal return on common equity through the cycle thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so id say right now in terms of the we feel like we are under earning we feel like that numbers going to go up over time itll go up as net interest income goes up but additionally i think the balance sheet is likely to stay kind of flattish here so the numerator is going to grow the denominator is going to stay pretty tight here so we think were under earning there we think through a cycle weve got to get back to more normal number like 230ish over time that takes a while its a grind mike quarterafterquarter so thats where were headed and in terms of return on allocated capital right now were right around that we want to be and higher for our shareholder a lot of it is because weve accrued an awful lot of capital over the course of time in advance of any potential capital changes and the other final thing id just remind you is were a little different than some of the regional banks in that weve got an enormous global markets business and that obviously makes an impact on the headline nim number mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just i wasnt clear you said net chargeoffs in the second half should be less than the first half and i wasnt sure if that related to cards or i wasnt sure what indiscernible chargeoffs brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah mike that was me and basically what im saying is you plateaued in terms of the delinquencies which means the second half is pretty well determined as you know because its just a march from days days to days and it will be the chargeoffs rate will be flattish we kind of back to normal at or so we underwrite to actually have a higher chargeoff rate quite frankly in that intolerance but that is kind of where we see it since mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so credit card chargeoffs should flatten or decline in the second half relative to the first half brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp exactly remember if you think about all the chargeoffs thats the dominant part of it on the consumer side by a lot and then the commercial we spoke to the question of cre office which has been dropped quartertoquarter and we expect the second half to be better also mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah operator well take our next question from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc how are you guys so wanted to ask just on just building on some of the nim questions from earlier a lot of its been focused on asset repricing both loans and securities and was hoping you could speak to the opportunity to potentially optimize some of your higher cost funding and just given multiple sources of nim improvement looking beyond how should we think about the pace of nim build as we i know its a longer timeline to get to the to but just how to think about the expectations around the nim trajectory beyond alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well your first point is a question of can we pay down some of the higher cost securities the answer to that is yes and that would be an expectation of ours as part of this weve got some shorterdated cds that can rolloff we can replace those or not we have shorter dated debt weve taken our longterm debt footprint down as weve continued to build the strength of the company so theres a lot of different ways it doesnt have to be securities reinvestment it can be paying down higher cost liabilities as well so weve got a lot of different ways that we can use the reinvestment if you like around fixed rate and then what was the second your second question was over indiscernible steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc the nim trajectory beyond alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so look were obviously on it right now we feel like this is the trough were trying to fill it from here and well make meaningful strides on that through thats where were going bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks for taking my questions brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp youre welcome operator well take our next question from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp morning betsy alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes another question on nii alastair i did i think hear you correctly when you said that as you go into the second half of theres going to be incremental benefits coming from swap rolloffs did i hear that right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah thats correct second half betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp of so as we get closer well be able to give you some kind of bridge like this that allows you to see what that looks like but its just a year out right now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah for sure but im just wondering is there anything thats like i guess what i just would like to understand a little better is how the swap book is impacting slide and then is it gradual into the second half of or is it a switch on in just understanding how the swap book is playing into this thing bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so the part thats important for slide around the second half of this year is just the bsby piece betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp its not from cash flow swaps any cash flow swaps we have the rolloff in the course of the next months really theyre all kind of current couponish because anything that we did there was to do with libor cessation or whatever so they all got recouponed so i wouldnt worry about that in the second half and onwards some of the older longerdated things theyve got the lower coupons so thats when the bsby number over time will disappear but in the second half of the cash flow number will begin to appear and well give you a sense for what that looks like over time betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it and then on the far right hand side of slide youve got the yellow box million to million could you just give us a sense as to whats the inputs to the million versus the million just so we can be able to track it as we go through the rest of the next few quarters alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah were essentially using four variables were thinking what will the loan growth be what will the deposit growth look like what will be the rotation between noninterest bearing and interest bearing and what will be any pricing changes we need to make right then the rotation and pricing are pretty closely interlinked if you could even call them the same thing if you use more conservative numbers you get towards the lower end if you use slightly more constructive numbers you get towards the higher i think the point were trying to convey is this last part this yellow box is always the unknowable at the beginning of the quarter where were projecting the pieces in the green we kind of feel like we know what those look like thats pretty predictable at this point that weve got a little more certainty around that so the teams we got people who are working really hard to try and make that dotted yellow box the higher end but obviously it depends on our assumptions and it depends on our actuals betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc super thank you so much for the color operator well take our next question from erika najarian of ubs bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just my first question is trying to square what youre telling us on the net interest income trajectory and the setup versus your disclosure so alastair you told us about as a response to glenns question the benefit from fixed asset repricing cash flow hedges repricing in the second half of and when i look at table from your q in both a parallel shift and a steepener scenario down bps is negative to net interest income is it because this is a 12month look and like you pointed out in the second half of you have under water cash flow hedges that are rolling off in other words as we go through do you get less asset sensitive and additionally what is the notional on those cash flow hedges that youre talking about alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so the asset sensitivity that we disclose is meant to give a sense for what happens if nothing changes its totally static so thats one difference number two its off of the future curve so its bps above whatever or below whatever the future curve is so i think its a really helpful thing for sort of shortterm moves in rates like take for example that orange box on page its helpful for something like that but its less helpful in terms of a predictor of where nii would be because theres so many other inputs erika over time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and just whats the notional of the cash flow hedges that youre referring to alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp over time lets say about billion erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and how much of that starts rolling off in the second half of alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think about it like this you can almost think about it like its billion or so every quarter its just that the ones that rolloff for the next months theyre all kind of current coupons so they wont really have any impact once you get into the second half of theyre a little bit lower rated so thats when you begin to get benefit there and then i think probably lee can give you more of the details following erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it if i could just slide in one more question on the normalized nim and clearly is much higher than where you are now alastair you mentioned we should assume a flattish balance sheet but i think our conversations with the company before in that half of that path between 19ish to to has to do with balance sheet efficiency and im wondering if you could carry out the balance sheet efficiency and keep your balance sheet flattish in other words obviously what the market is going to do is take your earning assets today and apply two three five and say okay over time whether its or this is what bofa can earn under a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 normalized curve im wondering if thats the right math to do or should we expect some shrinkage of the balance sheet if you can thats part of the path for alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i think what will happen is the underlying growth of the company will still be there but we have some things that we know just like steve asked that question is there any higher rate shorterdated stuff youd like to pay off yes there will be overtime so i think weve got some ability to almost like selffund the first billion billion of growth in terms of earning assets so thats where were seeing thatll keep the denominator down while were growing the numerator erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator well take our next question from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning hey alastair i just wanted to ask you a little bit more on the securities portfolio side because you also have what billion or so of pay fixed swaps on the afs book and so we know about the ph hfs hgm maturity schedule but how do you look at that afs book and how much are those pay fixed swaps currently in the money and kind of like how youre just thinking about that side of the portfolio as well thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah just remember those are received fixed so remember ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp that there remember that is when we put the afs in our portfolio its so that weve got a group of securities that are sitting there theyre typically treasuries we swap them to floating so that they look like theyre cash as far as were concerned we dont have to worry about in fact then to regulatory capital flowing through and they just to us they just look like cash equivalents so thats how we think about it ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just how do you manage that going forward with regards to like the rate forecast do those come off as the securities book matures bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i mean its less of an interest rate call for us its more of going back to this concept of weve got trillion of deposits and weve got trillion of loans so weve got billion of excess so when the excess comes in we can do a variety of different things wed love to put it in loans but thats always our first love but in the absence of that were going to put it in cash or were going to put it in available for sale probably swapto floating for the most part and we can choose to put things in hold to maturity if we choose to but obviously right now we feel like we want hold to maturity just continuing to pay down thats whats been happening over the course of the past quarters were just going to keep going with that so no particular changes to our philosophy around available for sale ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and a quick one on expenses i believe you said that costs are kind of hanging here at around the billion that was reported and so just kind of any color on puts and takes here or just is that better kind of revenuerelated comp against your ongoing efficiencies and just how do you think about longer term expense growth again thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp sure ken i think honestly the second quarter is sort of emblematic if you think about last years second quarter and this years second quarter we went up by million as alastair said million was just wealth management incentive comp and the other growth was really other incentive comp so the idea the pressures we face now are really more due to fee growth in the businesses which typically have a tighter correlation between fees and expenses and incentive comp related to those fees so that as alastair said thats a good expense growth is what you want it does grow and it grows at a good rate headcount has basically been bounced around relatively flat were at this quarter even adding a bunch of summer teammates we were at last year this quarter the same summer teammates included so managing head count redeploying people we have the cleanup stock going on we have the new initiatives going on were freeing up work and moving it so we feel good about managing the company and thats against inflation rate and wages that are going on inflation and all the services we buy in the third party markets obviously that the world experiences so we feel good about how were managing expenses the key is pretty simple as you follow the revenue side the equation alastair has been talking about your colleagues on nii stuff is that lifts and expenses stay relatively flat you start moving towards positive operating leverage were minus or something like that this quarter kind of hanging in there and well expect that to go back to the fiveyear track we had all the way up until the pandemic hit and things got thrown indiscernible ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks brian operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy of rbc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi brian hi alastair brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp morning gerard alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp hi there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc brian you talked and alastair both of you talked about the excess deposits i think it was slide you pointed to can you share with us as you go forward and assuming the federal reserve does cut into rates i know you put i think three fed fund rate cuts in your slide but as we go out into the end of the forward curve is calling for obviously more rate cuts could you tell us how you expect to price your deposits as rates continue to follow with this excess deposit level can you be more aggressive in lowering your deposit costs brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think thats very business and more importantly customerspecific views gerard so we think our deposit strategies in the context of how our customers utilize our services and so if you think about the parts that priced up in global banking or the investmentrelated cash in the consumer business and wealth management thatll come back down as rates come because the shortterm equivalents come down some is actually mechanical because its actually priced to meet moneymarket fund equivalent thatll happen and so yes i think if you think about it being allin if you look on that slide basis points there will be some pickup as rates come down in those higher things the zero interest balance accounts are low interest checking they dont really move because theres zero interest or low interest so they will be kind of static but they are still extremely valuable in the current context so when you think of all the consumer i think odd basis points or something thats driven by the fact that we have odd million transactional primary checking accounts that is growing at million a year multiple years in a row million a year that are maturing from up to or in balances as people mature their relationship with us thats where the tremendous value in the deposit base of this company goes and so if you think about trillion having grown billion almost from the trough you think about it growing linked quarter multiple quarters in a row you think about even as we look now by deposit balances above that amount those are good dynamics so we think about it but itll move but if you remember part of our deposit pricing is never going to move because its zero gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right no doubt when those are the golden deposits and one other question on slide and also i think if i recall your first quarter q you guys indicated you were assetsensitive i would assume that this slide also bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 shows that with the three rate cuts alastair what would it take to move to a more neutral position on the balance sheet or even a liabilitysensitive position should the fed really get into a rate cutting environment alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so this shows that were assetsensitive thats why the red box obviously is bigger than the green box its the mortgage piece thats liability sensitive so were still asset sensitive gerard what it would take for us is either we can have a lot more rotation into interest bearing or we combine some shortdated duration fixed rate so those are the two alternatives and if you look at the course of time if you were to go back to our qs over time youd see that we had become less and less rate sensitive over time weve really narrowed the corridor of where the rates go up by bps or down by bps what could that income look like narrowed that pretty substantially over time because were trying to lock in rates here recognizing nii is up billion or billion over the course of the past several years per quarter brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah the last thing id say gerard for a person whos been around this business as many years as you have this has been a very abnormal rate environment for the last years or so and if you get to where you have a fed funds rate which is what our experts predict it sort of stops out at the ability to bring the asset sensitivity tighter and tighter is there because you actually have room to move down without hitting zero floors and stuff so stability time periods of which the rate environment doesnt flip around and then secondly a higher nominal rate environment will allow you to manage to that outcome because part of the other outcome for us is just as the rate structure is nominally very low is the zero floors kick in and that creates an amount of sensitivity that over time will go away if rate structure is higher if that make sense to you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah no it does thank you and just brian or alastair one last quick question i noticed on slide home equity loan balance has actually increased i think thats the first time in maybe over two or three years was there a new program or what are you seeing that drives that and should that or can that continue as we go forward into thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think it just reflects that the people have locked in low rate loans and now they want to borrow its inexpensive view because theyve got a fixed rate mortgage loan and theyve got home equity sitting on top of why wouldnt they use it id like if it was only two years its been four or five years since that balance went from billion and started declining so its good to see ill note at bottom of that page if you look at yearoveryear mortgage production billion to billion and you look at home equity line production which is new originations in the boxes solid but it is nice to finally see that the actual balances have stabilized and well see they are kind of flattish they are not really growing but its nice to see them not just keep coming down and hopefully theyll start to be utilized our expectation would be they will be as consumers over time want to take out part of the equity in their home at a rate that is reasonable but doesnt require to refinance the whole first gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you again brian bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 operator well take our next question from vivek juneja of jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for the questions just a little color on noninterest bearing deposits when you look at on an average basis the decline has clearly slowed sharply period end was down at a faster rate is that just the noise around end of or what are you seeing as you look sort of month by month is that truly slowing and talk to it a little bit by customer segment if you can please alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i think vivek youre catching two things first one is it is slowing that rotation is slowing and we would expect that because at the end of the day this is mostly cash in motion its transactional accounts thats why its noninterest bearing and the answer why its a little different this quarter is because of the seasonality of tax payments for anyone who has a big tax payment due they frequently just allow it they may pull it out of their brokerage account put it into their noninterest bearing and then they are wiring it out from there so thats again an example of money in motion but thats whats going on this quarter vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc a quick one visa b derivative gains did you have anything in your equity derivatives trading revenues this quarter alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp nothing to highlight nothing to note thats a position we sold years ago and anything has happened with visa we just unwind on the balance sheet weve recycled it so it shouldnt have any impact to revenue vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator well take a question from matt oconnor of deutsche bank brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning how are you guys thinking about kind of targeted capital levels going forward obviously were still waiting for final rules maybe theres little more volatility in your scb than you would have thought but you still bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 got a nice buffer and then i guess one last piece i was thinking is the remixing of the balance sheet thats been commented kind of throughout this call over time probably causes a little creep in rwas right like loans higher than say securities so lots of excess capital but some puts and takes and how are you thinking about it between now and when we get final guidelines brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so first off i think we always want to use the capital to grow the business so if we need to use it to support rwa growth for loans or something thats a good outcome and thats what we want to do first second we maintain the quartertoquarter with a little bit rwa increase i think that would be sort of emblematic and we bought billion paid out billion in dividends so you expect that to kind of continue on in terms of that basic idea of we dont need a lot of capital to grow because the rwa demands are met with a fairly straightforward amount were earning a nice amount of dollars and well deploy it back in the dividend and the buybacks our job is to our view is will maintain a basis point type of management buffer to whatever the requirements are the volatility theres a whole different discussion on that in terms of the wisdom of that but the reality is the volatility is absorbable because you have time to play into it and get done within the race weve seen so whether we agree with the volatility or not we immediately absorb it and the new rules coming out well see what happens and well adjust but just because basically a requirement of under the new scb plus bps is maybe get a little tighter if you feel youve got great insight to what happens next year but and then i think the finalization of basel iii will come through and well see what that is and see how that all correlates to the various aspects but we feel good about where we are and expect all current earnings are basically available to support the growth were talking about in the current economic environment thats relatively modest need but really the rest of it just goes plowing back to you matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just to summarize that i mean do you think about bringing down the to kind of in the nearterm or just make it obvious like thats a little bit more theoretical and wait for the capital rules to play out brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think we just need to see the next days play out we heared a lot of discussion about the timing of the reproposal or not et cetera so we have a lot of flexibility but we continue to focus on shareholder value creation and all of that but i think were in a critical spot for the industry in terms of learning the outcome of a lot of these things over the next short period of time here matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator that concludes our questionandanswer session for the day id be happy to return the call to brian moynihan for closing comments bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 16jul2024 brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you operator thank all of you for joining us today obviously a lot of focus on nii and we gave you the slide to give you the bridge alastair answered a lot of the questions lee is here to answer the key is to understand whats driving that which is deposit performance which is stabilized and starting to grow for like six quarters in a row now loan growth very low and look very low but just staying positive those are going to drive the value of this franchise and thats going to vary growth by our customers thats coupled with strong fee performance this quarter in terms of wealth management fees investment banking fees consumer fees even growing global payment services fees and of course the great work done by our markets team so that level of flattish expenses gives us a chance to start driving operating leverage again in the company and that generates a lot of earnings a lot of excess capital and we put that back in your hands so thank you for your time and attention we look forward to talking to you next quarter operator this does conclude todays bank of america earnings announcement you may now disconnect your lines
