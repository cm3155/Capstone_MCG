management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to investor and analysts conference call for hsbc holdings plcs q3 results for your information this conference is being recorded at this time ill hand the call over to georges elhedery group chief financial officer georges elhedery group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you operator and hello everyone thank you for joining us on our third quarter results call today i will lead todays presentation and noel will join me for the qa session allow me first to begin by saying a few words on recent events in the middle east we have all been shocked by the devastating terrorist attack on israel on 7th of october and saddened by the growing humanitarian crisis in gaza the loss of innocent life and suffering is heart breaking we continue to offer assistance to our impacted colleagues and clients just to be clear we are not changing our strategy in israel or the middle east turning our results now as always our purpose ambition values and strategy have been helping us drive the results that i am going to talk about today some highlights to begin with hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 first of all the yeartodate performance clearly demonstrates that we have had three consecutive strong quarters reflecting the successful execution of our strategy yeartodate reported profit before tax was billion which is an increase of billion on the same period last year supported by higher interest rates and enabled by our strong balance sheet and the nonrecurrence of notable items we have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of excluding strategic transactions for the avoidance of doubt these transactions are the reversal earlier this year of the impairments relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in france and the gain on acquisition from svb uk weve announced another share buyback of up to billion bringing total buybacks announced this year up to billion and weve announced three quarterly dividends which total per share we have also exhibited good growth across our businesses wholesale transaction banking revenue was up yeartodate primarily due to higher rates and reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise wealth had another good quarter wealth balances were up by compared to the same quarter of last year and were also very pleased that we attracted billion of net new invested assets in the quarter bringing the rolling 12month total of billion which is a strong performance and testament to our strategy the planned acquisition of citis wealth business in mainland china will also help accelerate our growth plans for this business in our two home markets of hong kong and the uk we are also seeing good growth areas in hong kong insurance new business csm was up yearonyear and our mortgage books in asia and the uk grew by a total of billion compared to the third quarter of last year let me now move on to the third quarter numbers revenue was up was revenue was billion which was up billion or on last years third quarter on a constant currency basis this was driven firstly by group net interest income of billion which was up by billion on the same period last year and secondly nonnii was billion up by billion primarily due to first the nonrecurrence of billion impairment in last years third quarter relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in france second billion higher revenue offset into nonnii from the central cost of funding gbm trading activity and three offset by billion of treasury disposal losses taken for structural hedging and risk management purposes for our balance sheet banking nii of billion was up billion on last years third quarter and broadly stable on the second quarter expected credit losses of billion were broadly stable on the same period last year and included a billion charge in relation to our mainland china commercial real estate portfolio booked in hong kong costs were up in the quarter as lower restructuring costs were offset by higher technology spend a higher performancerelated pay accrual and costs from hsbc innovation banking lending balances and deposits were both broadly stable and our cet1 ratio was an increase of basis points on the second quarter finally we announced the third consecutive quarter of strong capital returns with a quarterly dividend of per share and a further share buyback of up to billion which we expect to complete before the fullyear results in february the next slide shows that our global businesses all performed well wealth and personal banking had a strong quarter with revenues up by or by excluding the impairment taken in last years third quarter relating to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 the sale of our retail banking operations and plans within this wealth was up by as our ongoing investment in that business continued to gain traction and personal banking also had another good quarter up by due mainly to higher rates across commercial banking and global banking and markets global payment services sic global payments solutions had revenues of more than billion which was an increase of on the third quarter of and in our trade business lending balances were up in the quarter mainly in asia reversing the declining trend from previous quarters global banking and markets also performed well up by this included a resilient performance in foreign exchange compared to a strong third quarter last year and a good performance in securities financing and debt markets on this next slide reported net interest income was billion which was broadly stable on the second quarter banking nii was billion up billion on last years third quarter and stable on the second quarter of this year as a reminder banking nii in the second quarter was favorably impacted by a billion yeartodate catchup due to methodology changes approximately half of which was attributable to the first quarter adjusting for this banking nii was slightly up in the quarter in this third quarter on a likeforlike basis the net interest margin remained broadly stable at basis points we are not updating our nii guidance and are also not expecting consensus to change next constant currency nonnii of billion was up billion on last years third quarter primarily due to number one a billion favorable movement in notable items and foreign exchange as last years third quarter included a billion impairment relating to the planned sale of our retail banking operations in france and this years third quarter included a billion of treasury disposal losses number two a billion increase in the revenue offset into nonnii from the central cost of funding gbm trading activity and number three a billion decrease in other which includes lower market sic markets treasury income we continue to reposition our treasury portfolio as part of our balance sheet structural hedging and risk management initiatives in the third quarter this resulted in billion of treasury disposal losses these losses do not have a material impact on cet1 capital or tnav as they have already been taken through reserves last year although they will have a modest benefit to our cet1 ratio this year the disposal proceeds are reinvested into higheryielding or higherduration assets disposal losses are forecast to be more than recovered through nii with the majority over the next five years further restructuring of the treasury portfolio leading to a loss of around billion is expected in the fourth quarter which will also be reported as a notable item and have modest cet1 upside turning now to credit our third quarter ecl charge was billion which was stable on the same period last year it includes a billion charge related to our mainland china commercial real estate exposure booked in hong kong following a billion charge in the same quarter last year the remaining wholesale charge was billion the billion personal lending charge included modest uk releases although we retain overlays to address the current risks in the economic outlook stage balances of billion were down billion on the second quarter and account for of total loans we continue to expect a ecl charge of around basis points of average gross customer lending including heldforsale balances hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 focusing now on our mainland china commercial real estate portfolio our principal area of focus remains the portfolio within hong kong as you can see our total exposure stands at billion which is down by billion from the halfyear primarily due to writeoffs in february this year we communicated the management assessed plausible downside scenario of around billion the deterioration in the third quarter means that we crystallized around million of provisions into the pl that were part of this plausible downside were encouraged by recent policy measures which will help the sector but need time to take effect so the plausible downside scenario does now look more realistic for fullyear our exposures rated strong good and satisfactory were broadly stable on the third quarter last year around half of these exposures is lending to stateowned enterprises the other half is primarily lending to privately owned enterprises that are not residential property developers this is reflected in the minimal ecl allowance in this part of the portfolio and if i now turn to the table at the bottom of the slide against unsecured credit impaired exposures we already have now coverage ratio and against unsecured substandard exposures we have a coverage ratio of just under this is clearly an area that we will continue to monitor closely but to reiterate we continue to expect a ecl charge of around basis points of average gross customer lending including heldforsale balances next on costs reported costs for the first nine month of were down on last year primarily due to lower restructuring costs our costefficiency ratio for the same period was improved from last year on a constant currency basis costs were up by on last years third quarter as the lower restructuring costs were offset by increased technology and operations spend a higher performancerelated pay accrual and the acquisition and investment costs from hsbc innovation banking which were not included in our original plans on our cost target basis we now expect our costs to be around higher than this is around or million more than previously guided due to higher technology and operations spending which we believe is appropriate given the importance of digitization for the group and the strong financial performance of the business in addition to this we are contemplating an increase in performancerelated pay in the fourth quarter depending on the outturn of our performance and ongoing execution of our strategy in the fourth quarter this would represent a further increase of around we have provided a full reconciliation from reported cost to our target basis cost on slide of the deck and to reiterate tight cost discipline remains my priority and a priority across the whole group the next slide shows our strong capital position our cet1 ratio was which was up basis points on the second quarter a few things to draw your attention to number one dividend accrued yeartodate is billion or per share while we have announced dividends of billion or per share number two we have announced a further share buyback of up to billion which is expected to have a circa 40basispoint impact on our cet1 ratio in the fourth quarter we are aiming to complete it before the fullyear results in february number three we also expect to reclassify our retail banking operations in france as held for sale in the fourth quarter ahead of completion of the planned sale on the 1st of january which would have a further impact on the cet1 ratio of around basis points hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 finally the planned sale of our canada banking business also remains on track to complete in the first quarter of and as a reminder profits from our canada banking business accrue to the buyer and are not included in our dividend calculations for the year we estimate the gain on sale will be around billion which we will recognize through a combination of earnings from canada and the remaining gain on sale at completion upon completion of the transaction it remains our intention to consider a special dividend of per share as a priority use of the proceeds and as previously announced so in summary this was another strong quarter we delivered a good profit performance and an annualized return on tangible equity of excluding strategic transactions reflecting the successful execution of our strategy transaction banking and wealth both performed well and continued investment will help accelerate the growth of our wealth business we continue to expect a ecl charge of around basis points of average gross customer lending we remain committed to tight cost discipline and we have a strong capital position and have increased return to shareholders by way of dividends and share buybacks and with that operator can we please open it up for questions thank you question and answer section operator thank you george operator instructions our first question today comes from aman rakkar from barclays please accept the prompt to unmute your line aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning george hope you can hear me okay georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc we can hear you very well aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much two questions please on firstly on costs can i just probe you a little bit more on exactly whats changed around costs because i think as recently as midseptember hsbc were reiterating their expectations for costs very much in line with the existing guide and the commitment to the cost base so particularly around the point around compensating the staff potentially compensating staff performance i understand that its been a strong year for profits but it didnt look like the view of profitability changed materially since you all spoke to us so that component there would be interesting and the related point then is to what extent should we expect that element of cost growth to roll over into next year and i guess indiscernible im trying to get a sense of what the underlying cost growth is that youre currently seeing through the business and then the second question was around margins i was wondering if you could just help us with a bit on your experience on deposit beta and term deposit mix and particularly in hong kong but also a comment on the uk would be helpful and as part of that what your expectations are for nim in both of those markets please thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you aman so first on costs i think with regard to this cost we contemplate for q4 so look we have to put this in the perspective of the financial performance obviously at the start of the year we werent necessarily realizing the performance of the group we obviously need to wait for q4 both to assess the financial performance but equally to assess how we continue to deliver on our strategy it ultimately will be a matter for the board and the remuneration committee to decide but we felt it appropriate and fair to recognize that our colleagues have contributed participated for the last many years through the whole strategic reshaping of the firm through ensuring we have a great deposit franchise and a strong balance sheet and obviously delivering the growth weve seen in wealth and transaction banking that we can channel or the equivalent million towards performancerelated pay again all this is at the stage of contemplation a matter we will reaffirm at the yearend and again subject to our remuneration committee s opinion in terms of next year no were not giving guidance for next year but i think we are reflecting in this performance related pay a yearonyear material change in our performance as youve seen from our returns and our pbt which obviously with that quantum probably not expect for next year right in terms of margins aman so as we indicated at these levels of rates in mostly in the uk and certainly in a number of western markets and for our wholesale businesses at these levels of rates we were expecting to have a materially higher betas than weve expected that additional rate hikes from here would be mostly for the benefit of our customers if you look at the overall betas in the uk overall betas around just north of so while the marginal betas have exceeded the overall is in the range of term deposit mix hong kong kind of same trend as weve seen through the nine months coming to this quarter about migration per month so we have seen over the quarter of the previous quarter and in the quarter one that took the total term deposit mix to in hong kong we have not seen a deterioration of the trend we expect the trend to remain the same as we look into potential headwinds in the future but equally we continue to see some of the tailwinds we were calling out before to continue just to put in perspective the uk term deposits mix is just singledigit percentage point so well be able to modestly increase in q3 but its not a main contributor to the dynamic of our nii noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george if i could just add a if i could just add a couple of comments on the vp there were two factors that were really coming to play in q3 at the halfyear when we talked about our cost position we had an eye to vp and we had a very strong first six months of the year there was a lot of economic uncertainty around at that time inflation interest rates ecls china commercial real estate so we didnt want to anticipate exactly what the financial performance would be in the final six months of the year we were confident of midteen returns but we needed to make sure that the final six months traded well i think as weve gone through q3 weve continued to trade well so i think our expectations now on a full year out so are probably higher than they would have been when we started this year and started to build the financial plan for this year so in the context of things weve given an indication that given the strong profit performance and if it continues into q4 it will be indiscernible share some of that upside in profit compared to original hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 expectations with our colleagues the way that we intend to share the upside in expectations with our shareholders on both dividends and buybacks and a million topup to vp for the level of performance could well out turn this year is a reasonable amounts of additional vp to put in i will remind you that vp is not a continuum and a baseline it is assessed each year on the profit of the bank against targets and can go up and can go down but thats a final determination well make at the end of the year and were just trying to be fair to our colleagues on what theyve done but its a factor of uncertainty at the halfyear over trading performance has become less uncertain as weve gone into q3 and youve seen the numbers and we hope well continue in q4 in a strong manner and if thats the case we feel we should reward our colleagues for a very strong performance this year but its thats the background to it we remain both myself and george remain absolutely committed to strong cost discipline georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you aman next question please operator our next question today comes from joseph dickerson from jefferies please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi can you hear me georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes joseph carry on joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thank you very much for taking my question just following up on cost i suppose how much of the tech and op cost spend was if you will necessary versus discretionary in terms of needing to keep up with competitors and so forth and then the other aspect would be on the trading book funding costs youve guided to greater than billion for the full year and on my numbers youre already at billion so that implies a material stepdown in that costs unless we should be emphasizing on the in excess of billion element there any color on that front would also be helpful many thanks georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you joseph so maybe ill answer your second question its fairly easy you should definitely as you mentioned emphasize the in excess of billion we actually havent revised our guidance we felt by and large that the consensus in the right place and didnt need to influence it we expect the trading balancesp joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd so its a similar run rate similar quarterly run rate we should be thinking about hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so purely for the funding cost of the trading books you should expect that the trading balances will remain broadly stable at around billion for the quarter then kind of the math are simple its just that times the short tail rate levels essentially in usd as you look at the overall banking nii i think the indication is that weve grown billion q2 to q3 we havent given indication for q4 again feel comfortable with where the consensus is for q4 and just reiterate that banking nii is probably a better measure because it kind of gets you immunized for some of these choices we make and how much we fund the trading book with with regards your first question about tech and ops so its a mix of necessary and discretionary we made the decision on the basis that well first when we put our cost base at the start of the year we had a materially higher inflation than in some areas in some geographies and some pockets than we anticipated for the year and we felt that it would be adverse for certain customer outcomes if we needed to take a more restrictive action on it and this is putting it in the context that our nine months yeartodate reported cost is down yearonyear is down yearonyear so this is why were willing to tolerate the continued investment in tech and ops i just want to reaffirm what noel said were absolutely committed to our cost discipline and we will be giving you visibility about how were spending our money now and in the future thank you joseph next question please operator our next question today comes from jason napier from ubs please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hello jason jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch good morning can you hear me okay now georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc we can hear you jason jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch thank you the first one please on the million of losses on the hedge reset and risk management this quarter and the extra sort of million thats penciled in for q4 i wonder whether you wouldnt mind adding a bit of color in terms of exactly what it is youre doing there the payback period you said is said sort of longer than five years it feels like a downside risk hedge thats being put in place if you could just talk about how much you might get the sensitivity down once all is said and done and just confirm that it really pays indiscernible rather than support revenues in the near term hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 and then secondly weve had a busy week of mainland chinese bank reporting indiscernible forecasts and one of your peers wrote down their mainland chinese state with their third quarter results i wonder could you update us please on where value in use is versus book value on bocom and how that process runs towards year end thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you jason so first on the treasury losses so a few things to share here first is we see this as one of the multiple tools we have to manage our structural hedge and obviously to manage the risk in our balance sheet second importantly the losses themselves have been taken already into cet1 mostly last year so these are already effected in our cet1 and this is why effectively they had a mild cet1 ratio benefit where we sit today and then third as you indicated jason we are looking to retrieve these losses in the nii line essentially over the next five years so this is a reinvestment into either longerdated or higheryielding instruments by disposing faster disposing of loweryielding instruments to allow us to kind of move faster on our structural hedging of the balance sheet if you wanted some sense of kind of math you could argue if weve taken million losses its about million loss additional nii every year for the next six years or so which kind of gives you a sense of how were looking at it and its indeed as part of our structural hedging which means part of how were mitigating or protecting the balance sheet mitigating risks of a rate downfall in the future on your second question jason about the mainland china so first i can comment on bocoms q2 performance because as you know in our numbers we have one quarter delay so the exercise relates to q2 our value in use as of q3 has room of about billion compared to our carrying value so look impairment is not a management discretionary decision right theres a rigorous accounting process and well just follow the process and based on their q3 results we will evaluate those as we go into q4 and that will be part of our end ofyear assessment i think the important thing i want to share about bocom is because it sits in significant investments and because we hold capital deductions regulatory capital deductions against it and as you can see it from the slide on capital billion capital deduction it effectively means that any impairment on our holding of bocom should it happen will have virtually nil cet1 ratio impact and thats because any impairment will be compensated likefor like by a release of the deductions of a similar amount so therefore no implication on cet1 well also and have an implication on reported profits accounting reported profits but well treat it as a material notable item and it will have no implications either on the way we calculate our dividend or our dividend payout ratio so this is why at this stage this is not a concern well just follow the accounting rules as we do the viu assessment noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc jason just for clarity based on the impairment test we did at q3 we have headroom against our carrying value there is no impairment due q3 and well reassess it at q4 but based on the q3 results that bocom issued a couple of days ago those results at a headline level firstsight did not cause us any concern on our impairment test at q3 but well reassess that at q4 hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel youll have the details in the ara in how we do the impairment testing for the value in use of bocom jason in case you need it thank you jason can we move to the next question operator our next question today comes from gurpreet singh sahi from goldman sachs please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thank you very much for letting me ask a question good morning noel good morning george noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc so first one on loan growth how do we see the areas of loan growth going into next year weve done a good growth around mortgages but they have been offset by shrinkage in the commercial book so thats the first one so in terms of medium term of course we are highlighting midsingle digit but specifically as interest rates remain high how is the borrowing appetite into next year and then the second one with respect to the special dividend timing the will it be paid by june or will it be announced towards the second quarter and paid later on thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you gurpreet so in terms of loan growth look what weve observed so far is strong growth in continued growth in mortgages we said billion yeartodate essentially in hong kong and the uk that continued even this quarter despite the softness in the housing market but we remain competitive and we continue to support this business for our customers so that is definitely there were also seeing some loan growth in the unsecured space in our retail business it will be smaller proportions in terms of commercial the reality is the main softness in loan growth in commercial is in hong kong and this is whats driving the commercial overall number the softness is hong kong has two parameters one the rate differential with mainland china and as long as we have such a rate differential it is expected to have mainland chinese borrowers continue borrowing onshore mainland china rather than borrowing offshore because of the rate differential and that probably will not reverse in the next couple of years but also two is some of the softness weve seen in the economic conditions in hong kong which we start to see reversing and weve been encouraged by the policy measures that have been taken by way of supporting the economy and if those materialize we will start seeing some pickup in this segment hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 now outside this softness areas we do still have strong loan growth potential in growing areas in our geographies such as southeast asia such as india such as the middle east we even had growth in some of the western economies so that is happening quite importantly also i want to call out growth in trade i called it out in the earlier kind of speech if you want but trade is bucking the trend for the first quarter where weve seen growth in our loan book after several quarters of decline and thats encouraging well obviously need to see how it evolves but thats definitely encouraging and if you look at it most of that growth is in asia which means its bucking the trend in asia and thats probably on the back well certainly on the backdrop of now the trade between china and asean has exceed the trade between china and europe or china and us and that obviously will benefit given our footprint in china and asean on the special dividend gurpreet at this stage were aiming for completion of canada sometime in q1 we will then have to go through due governance and due approvals before we do it i think h1 is reasonable to expect but its obviously at this stage just a matter of a process we need to go through i think thats what i can say at this stage as soon well well pay it as soon as we can gurpreet thats what we can say at this stage gurpreet singh sahi q analyst goldman sachs asia llc thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you gurpreet next question please operator our next question today comes from manus costello from autonomous please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question manus costello q analyst autonomous hi good morning thanks for taking the question can i probe you a bit more on the hedging that youve got in place youve talked about increased hedging for the last couple of quarters and you have this quarter as youve discussed previously taken some losses through the heldforsale portfolio to improve the nii next year where we lack a kind of an overall understanding of what youve got in terms of the hedge and so my question specifically is how big is your hedge and whats the duration of your hedge so that we can do some modeling to understand how much protection youve got into and beyond thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you manus a very insightful question we are intending to have much more disclosure around our structural hedge at the full year were planning to give you additional disclosures from the one we already gave today which is the usual nii table with the multiple rate shifts in over the five years that includes duration that includes yield on the structural hedge et cetera which hopefully can allow you to model all of this were not ready to do it at q3 it will be more appropriate to do it at the full year i think what you should take into account is some of the information we shared at the halfyear which is the hedge itself has allowed us to reduce our nii sensitivity at the back end of last year from billion for basis hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 point down to now billion over which you should add the funding of the trading book sensitivity of billion so thats giving you an idea of how much the overall hedge among other contributors have supported the reduction of our nii volatility and our nii sensitivity to the downward pressure on rates and i think you should definitely assume that it remains our intention at this phase of the cycle in rates to continue doing hedges as appropriate across all our balance sheets where we can find them so more on that at the full year manus thank you for the question manus costello q analyst autonomous i look forward to it thank you operator our next question today georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc next question please yeah operator our next question today comes from raul sinha from jpmorgan please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc hi good morning noel georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning raul raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc a couple of followups from me please if i can i guess the first one is just around slide looking at the split of nim across your main subsidiaries im just trying to understand the underlying nim trajectory for the bank in the absence of any rate changes from here on if you look at the uk bank the ringfenced bank obviously thats that margin has been under pressure this quarter and a number of peers are obviously flagging the lag effect on deposit costs as well as the migration is going to have an impact in q4 i was just wondering if you could give us a little bit color on what you think is the outlook for your business in terms of margin in the uk and then i guess just linking it back to the group margin which is as you said broadly stable but starting to come under a little bit pressure the hiborlibor gap is obviously very narrow seasonally i guess libor tends to go up in q4 but when we take a step back and think about the overall margin trajectory would you say that in the absence of rate changes the margin is stable or do you think theres a little bit more pressure sort of creeping in because of what is going on in the uk thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 sure okay thank you raul okay so let me unpack there are quite a number of considerations here so the first one is i would kind of as always will encourage you to look at banking nii because that will first its a better reflection of our ratesensitive earnings and second it will immunize you from some of the kind of business choices we make by putting more money into the trading more funding to support the trading activities or not and that can create noise in nii versus funding of the trading book which is annihilated when you look at it from a banking nii perspective now talking a little bit on q3 before i talk about the outlook on the q3 numbers if you look at banking nii in hong kong it was up now this is not reflected in nim nim is up two basis points but essentially because a lot of that upside went into the funding of the trading book but the from ratesensitive earnings in asia in our asian entity has grown by about billion so thats the first thing to observe if you look at hibor rates q2 to q3 obviously they were up basis points when we look at q4 todate theres another something like basis points baked in the average so there is additional tailwind into q4 from hibor which well obviously need to see how the next two months fare before we evaluate if you look at the uk so the uk nim was up basis points q1 to q2 down basis points q2 to q3 the first thing i want to say is this is definitely not the trend here to be read i think nim is broadly stable from here for the next few quarters some of these moves are kind of idiosyncrasies in our market treasury management not necessarily drivers of trends so were looking at it in the whole as broadly stable obviously it continued facing pressure on deposit costs but as i just said earlier at these rates any additional rate hikes are expected to be passed through to customers and this is whats been happening so weve benefited from 75basispoint rate hike in pounds between q2 and q3 most of which has gone either to customers in the form of passthroughs some term deposits migration in the uk indiscernible but some and then obviously asset margin compression in the uk so as you look forward how can i kind of invite you to evaluate forward first im not giving guidance for were the only guidance weve given for is now is the midteens rote we will be giving more details at the yearend but if you want some indicators of how to think about it first think about it as we will continue facing the usual headwinds of margin compression but that probably is easing now having seen most of that compression in q2 and q3 we will continue to see pressure on deposits migration may continue weve seen a pace of per month in hong kong kind of steady for the last nine month that is likely to continue and then as you so these will be the main headwinds the tailwinds so the tailwinds would be one the additional rate upside in hong kong from hibor probably no further rate upside in the major other currencies the tailwinds will be reinvestments of maturing structural hedges that have been put at lower rates and as they mature we reinvest them in higher rates and that will give us additional tailwinds and then look the main tailwind which we anticipate at some stage in but not yet at least not for the next couple of quarters but at some stage in is volume growth when we start seeing volume growth we will see the support for the nii in the mediumterm as weve always indicated midsingledigit percentage point growth for our balance sheet is our midterm aspiration and as and when this starts after the next couple of quarters of transition this will give us the additional tailwinds i suppose thats probably as much as we can say at this stage raul thank you for your question i think we can hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks george georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc take the next one operator our next question today comes from perlie mong from kbw please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question perlie mong q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hello thank you for taking my question i guess just a couple of followups the first one is on your hedge strategy because i guess youve basically in the disposal of losses youve essentially i guess brought forward some of the rolling of the hedge which i guess we havent really seen so much in especially in uk banks they tend to sort of use it as a sort of pure smoothing mechanism as it were if you just let the lower rates run off and then reinvest in but you seem to have brought forward that so i guess the question is you know does that suggest that youre not just using the hedge as a smoothing mechanism but its too its too sort of more actively sort of traded as it were is that fair i guess is the first question and the second question i guess its really for noel i just saw on bloomberg that you made a comment that you feel like china cre situation has bottomed out i mean acknowledging that the chinese government has taken steps to support the sector but the news flow still seemed to be pretty negative and to the extent that there have been actions taken they are probably not as large as maybe some of the market would have expected or hopeful a few months ago so its probably around tailoring deposit requirements in some of the tier cities so i guess just what gives you the confidence that we have bottomed out georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc perfect thank you perlie ill take the first question and ill invite noel obviously to comment on your second one so look the hedge strategy first we have a number of tools at our disposal we will use them as effectively and as opportunistically as we can to achieve what we want to achieve which is number one reducing the downside sensitivity of our balance sheet to a reduction in rates and number two extending that reduction of downside as far out in time as possible the this strategy that weve used which is disposing of existing low earning positions is one of these measures so number one to remind you it does not have the cet1 impact at least the loss does not have a cet1 impact because the loss has been taken capital mostly in already so that gives us this flexibility on our capital the second one is yes part of the hedge considerations is indeed allowing us to extend higher yields for longer rather than be rather than kind of retain some of the loweryielding assets for longer than we wish for and give hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 us additional protection and the third is its also risk management consideration we also look at how we use our rwas and treasury portfolio and how we can optimize the utilization thereof and how we use combination of bonds and swap hedges and in fair value accounting relationships et cetera so there are all sorts of number of other considerations which we look at but the outcome of which for the purposes of our bottom line is indeed giving us this run way now i need to point out weve done an exercise in q3 we indicate that we intend to do another exercise to the tune of about billion in q4 but we do not look at this as a recurring activity right this is a kind of by exception occasional when risk management and performance justify it we will do it this is not meant to be a recurrent quarteronquarter activity i just want to be clear about that weve done it last quarter well do it next quarter anything beyond that we will give you indications but it will be on a casebycase and occasional basis noel for the second question noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah on china cre my comments this morning were really about the massive policy correction that has taken place over the last months in commercial real estate in china it has really impacted very heavily the real estate market do i think the big negative correction in the market has been delivered and do i expect further negative correction no i think what were now into is the workout phase of that policy correction equally i think i said this morning i dont see a big swing back into positive policy territory for commercial real estate i see it as finetuning from this low base so what im talking about is the market as a whole the commercial real estate market in china a massive correction down i think were at the bottom of that correction phase and were now in a gradual replying back out with possible policy tweaks taking place but as you quite rightly say probably there are not going to be big swings back up in policy correction theyre going to be smaller policy correction taking place as weve seen in recent weeks now what does that mean for ecls for banks both domestically and internationally well those ecls have and could still emerge over time but i think the market itself has bottomed and now were in a period of sort of readjustment for the new norm and i dont see a big readjustment back up from our point of view on ecls i think we feel as george has said weve got good coverage ratios on the unsecured book of our offshore book that is soerelated or poerelated we do not see that same policy correction affecting the soes the way its affected the poes so we dont see necessarily a downside on that at this stage and on those poes in that i talked about those poes are largely the secured or theyre not in the residential sector theyre in cre and other forms of the sector so i think from our point of view we feel wellprovisioned at this stage its not to say that there arent potential problems on the horizon from an ecl point of view for the industry but we feel as though were well positioned but i suppose my bottoming comment was on the market as a whole in that theres been such a massive correction i think were now in a gradual rebuild but that gradual rebuild will take time and there will be the potential for the industry to bear some further losses and we are keeping a close eye on that and what it means for us but we think were well provisioned at q3 level hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 were probably going to take some more of our downside possible downside scenario in q4 but as george said earlier we think that weve got the capacity within our overall guidance on ecl of basis points to absorb any further charges we may or may not take in q4 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel thank you perlie lets move to next question please operator our next question today comes from rob noble from deutsche please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag morning thank you for taking my questions just on the treasury sales youve announced another potential million in q4 why not do them all in q3 whats the advantage of waiting if youre just going to realize a loss and do it why not just do them all now secondly just a little bit more on china whats the sensitivity of the balance sheet to rates in china and how concerned are you about the rate differential between china and hong kong what are the moving parts of that differential on all of the businesses not from just the commercial side thanks georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you rob so on your first point i mean look this is a matter of phasing it in time so that were doing it thoughtfully carefully were evaluating the impact every time we do an activity so i dont think there is a we didnt put a cut off per say for q3 and q4 as you can see the numbers arent mathematically or arent kind of they dont follow a given symmetry its just a matter of where we are on the journey when we kind of cut off the books on the 30th of september but we carry this activity throughout and we look for the right market opportunities to do it i think this is the way we would look at it in with regards to your second point a couple of things i can share here rob the first one is the rate sensitivity of china so just to give you an indication the impact of the china nim on our hbap or our asia nim is about basis points so the fact that we have some rate compression in china simply because of the policy rates you have a compression this has affected our overall asia nim by a couple of basis points so thats the quantum or the magnitude given obviously the size and scale we have in hong kong versus the size and scale we have in mainland china and other geographies the second one to call out is that the rate differential we expect it to remain for a matter of many quarters probably a couple of years which does mean that that offshore well that mainland chinese customers borrowing offshore in hong kong will probably remain subdued for the next couple of years because its much cheaper for them to borrow at lower rates in rmb and this headwind is likely to continue for the next couple of years now on the flip side again because of the rate differential the growth in wealth that we observe in hong kong is obviously a positive and a beneficiary of the rate differential so the fact that were seeing more wealth buildup in hong kong the fact that were seeing more demand for our insurance products and capabilities in hong kong also reflects the fact that for mainland chinese for some you know for some of them and subject to the quotas hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 they are allowed to do et cetera it is interesting its an attractive proposition to invest offshore because theyre getting the rate pickup so were seeing the benefits of that when we talk about our insurance business in hong kong and our new business csm while were seeing the terms on the other side look all this at the end per se is we remain we remain very optimistic in the medium to longterm on both hong kong and mainland china and we just need to see some of the shortterm difficulties play out specifically in mainland china specifically in the real estate sector until we recover and are able to see some of the momentum back on positive growth there georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you rob suggest we move to the next question operator we have time for one last question today from andrew coombs from citi group please accept the prompt to unmute your line and ask your question andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning ill ask a couple if thats okay just a quick one firstly you reiterated a greater than billion nii guidance in the past youve talked about being comfortable with incentives which is obviously above that billion so if i could just push you as to whether you are still comfortable with the consensus and then second question buybacks and how youre thinking about those obviously a step change today going from q2 to q3 for the next quarter pro forma for the buyback and the branch retail youre looking at a core tier ratio still within your target range you said rote is similar to payout ratio for the dividend similar to so the only delta seems to be loan growth where youre still talking of course is short term by aiming for midsingle digits in mediumterm so when were thinking about the buyback going forward is it a tradeoff with that loan growth so is it a case that the loan growth goes to midsingle digit you go back to billion whereas if it stays lowsingle digit you stay at billion conceptually how are you thinking about the buyback thank you georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you andrew okay on your first question nii guidance i can yeah i can reaffirm were still comfortable with the consensus as you look into we havent given guidance yet apart from the midteens rote but id like to kind of just point out two things just to keep in mind the first one is again banking nii would be a better guide of how our earnings will behave with rates so look at nii in combination with a from the cost of the trading book and immunize therefore your analysis from how much we end up channeling or not in terms of funding to the trading book activities and then the second one just to keep in mind is the disposal of canada and france which will both contribute to an annualized billion of nii whichll obviously not be there as and when they go away as and when the sale is complete hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 and then finally balance sheet growth at some stage in where we kind of start resuming the expectation of our balance sheet to grow thats i think you know in the broad sense how we should look at for again were not guiding but were giving you some tools so you can do your analysis in terms of buyback so a couple of things first the reason we announced a 3billion buyback certainly because we have the capital to support it but equally because we have an extended period to do it we mentioned that this is an intent to do it up to february results that gives us four months so ill definitely encourage you not to look at billion as the new billion it is not it is a reflection of the fact that we are aiming for the well we have a longer period ahead of us four months instead of three and we are aiming to see if we can get up to billion during that period its therefore kind of a specific consequence of this length of the period that is ahead of us for that buyback we you know look i continue saying it remains our intention to perform a rolling series of share buybacks as long as the capital is supported we look at our forecast and our capital does our capital buildup does seem to be reasonably realistic in our forecast and therefore it remains our intention to do the series of buybacks about the question of tradeoff between buybacks and loan growth a couple of things first as you know the proceeds of the sale of canada will give us a buyback runway regardless of loan growth because that the gain the proceeds less the priority use for special dividend will still allow for a few billion dollars of additional buyback and irrespective of our loans so that will give us runway for loan growth second i just need to also highlight when we talk about midsingledigit loan growth were not saying midsingle digit rwa growth some of our loans specifically in the mortgage space which is a big component for our loan growth have lower rwa density and therefore benefit from lower rwas and therefore our rwa growth is expected to trail loan growth kind of absent credit reviews and therefore we dont see that there is a competition between loan growth and buybacks i think this is a fine balance between the two and appropriate tradeoff between the two this is andrew probably how much i can say at this stage of your question georges elhedery group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you very much ill move straight to the closing remarks thank you everyone for joining us today and for your questions i want to end by reiterating that weve had a good nine month all of our businesses have been performing well we have delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of when you exclude strategic transactions and we remain committed to tight cost discipline were investing in growth while were also supporting dividends and buybacks and i will be looking forward to speaking with you all again soon so have a good morning or afternoon everyone thank you very much noel quinn group chief
