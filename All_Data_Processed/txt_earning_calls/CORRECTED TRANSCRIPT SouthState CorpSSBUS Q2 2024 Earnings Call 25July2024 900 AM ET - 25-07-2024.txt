which may affect us now ill turn the call over to john corbett our ceo southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 john c corbett chief executive officer director southstate corp thank you will good morning everybody thanks for joining us it felt like southstate was firing on nearly all cylinders in the second quarter we saw the longanticipated inflection of our net interest margin noninterest income was up expenses were wellcontrolled and earnings per share were up from last quarter on the balance sheet deposits are still a challenge but loans grew better than forecast and asset quality is in good shape with only basis points in chargeoffs the most impactful event of the second quarter was obviously the announcement of the independent financial transaction we spent the month of june in town hall meetings with employees in dallas denver austin and houston and david and his team were incredibly welcoming and hospitable theyre all terrific with no branch overlap and no change to the geographic leadership structure it makes this much easier to integrate and for our bankers to keep their focus on serving their clients and building the bank weve already filed the proxy and weve scheduled for the shareholder vote for next month we also filed the regulatory applications on july so things are progressing on schedule we walked through the strategic rationale when we announced the deal in may were expanding into great markets in fact therere some of the only markets in the country that match the demographic growth profile of our current markets both from people migration and income migration we also talked about the financial power with earnings per share accretion but i want to take a minute and drill down on how were thinking about the deal from a capital management perspective as an industry were on the back end of the fastest increase of interest rates in decades our industry currently suffers from loans and investments that are underearning their potential because theyre not yielding current market rates thats a negative overhang that will last for years but the positive is the industry enjoys the benefit of strong capital ratios so the question for every bank management team is how to utilize surplus capital to reposition the balance sheet and unlock the earnings potential of these assets rather than waiting years many of our peers have chosen to execute a bond swap and thats fine but a bond swap never got us particularly excited as a capital management strategy we looked at it as a dollarfor dollartrade you invest a dollar of capital and you get a dollar of earnings but you accelerate the timing of the cash flows again thats fine from a financial engineering perspective but it feels to us like a dollarfordollar trade what were doing with independent is a more powerful use of capital just like a bond swap were unlocking the earnings power of the bonds at independent financial but its not just the bonds were unlocking the earnings potential of their entire loan portfolio so including both loans and investments its about a billion interest rate swap on all earning assets but heres the key rather than a dollarfordollar trade the thing that makes this different is that were utilizing the southstate valuation and currency advantage simultaneously with the investment of capital which makes the swap much more powerful as a capital management approach layering both the normal economies of scale we gain in the transaction plus the currency advantage and we see this as a far far better use of capital than a bonilla bond swap all billion of earning assets moves to market rates and the rates are instantly locked ph independent net interest margin opens wide and the only rate movement going forward will be deposit rates as we move into a period of likely lower rates southstate should benefit as a more liability sensitive balance sheet with independent southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 i want to thank david and dan brooks dan strodel and the entire independent team for making us feel so welcome and for their enthusiasm of what were building together ill turn it back over to will to provide more color on the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp thanks john total revenue of million for the quarter was a bit better than forecasted with net interest income of million and noninterest income of million that total revenue number was up million from q1 on an equal day count our nim of rose basis points and was in line with our expectations as deposit cost increases slowed to basis points at the lower end of our to basis point guidance for a cost of total deposits of basis points for the quarter and as loan yields increased basis points from the prior quarter also within our guidance of to basis points ill note what appears to be something of an inflection point this is the first quarter since q4 of where our improvement in loan yields exceeded our increase in cost of deposits that brings our total cumulative deposit beta to and our cumulative loan beta to confirming our expectations our deposit mix shift appears to have slowed in fact for the quarter average dda balances were up slightly versus q1 and the average mix of ddas to total deposits was unchanged from q1s steve will give some color on our future margin guidance in the qa noninterest income was up million from q1 a bit better than we expected nie excluding nonrecurring items of million was up million from q1 and moderately above q2 of levels looking ahead the remainder of the year we have merit increases for most of the bank that were effective july so compensation expense will increase there are also some project and related expenses we expect to hit in the second half of the year so nie in q3 and q4 is still likely to be in the million range as always nie is somewhat dependent on expense items that vary with revenue our million in provision expense essentially matched the quarters net chargeoffs leaving the total reserve levels flat and when combined with loan growth caused the total reserve to loans to decline basis points to npls were up million centered in one loan where we have guarantors with substantial liquid capacity and where we expect to resolve this credit favorably past dues and payment performance improved and are as strong as weve seen in recent memory and we continue to expect that we will not see significant losses in the loan portfolio based upon current forecasts lastly on the balance sheet front loan growth of annualized brought yeartodate growth to a annualized rate and deposits were flat with q1 levels with ending deposits down slightly and average deposits up approximately capital improved with our tce ratio growing to our cet1 to and our tbv per share ending at operator well now take questions southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from the line of michael rose of raymond james please ask your question michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp hey mike michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to get a sense on just the loan growth expectations i know you guys had previously talked about kind of midsingle digits i think this quarter was a little bit better than what i was looking for just any sort of thoughts that you guys have and but you can just talk about kind of from the business perspective what your customers are telling you would you expect to see assuming everything works out with the election the regulatory side maybe is there any pentup demand just trying to get a sense for what customer activity looks like thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah good morning michael its john yeah youre right we referenced about midsingledigit loan growth guidance early in the year and really thats what were tracking weve done about loan growth a little stronger in the second quarter i think last quarter michael we mentioned that our pipelines had grown significantly starting in november of last year and that pipeline growth translated into loan production growth in the second quarter our loan production grew from billion in the first to about billion in the second quarter so its about increase in loan production the growth is really broad based the biggest contributor were seeing is ci credits largely middle market companies and were seeing the strongest growth out of the carolinas and in the last year we benefited from the funding of construction loans that were made in earlier in and that tailwind probably abates here in the coming quarters so we may lose some of that benefit but pipelines are currently stable so we think our current guidance is still appropriate but as always it can be lumpy from quartertoquarter but the payoffs of the wild card theyve been historically low last few quarters but were starting to see some multifamily sales activities so payoffs might increase michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful and then i am just switching to credit you guys for a bunch of quarters built the reserves pretty meaningfully you did have some modest upward migration understanding its off of very low levels but the reserve did come down the provision was i think much less than me and others were looking for can you just southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 discuss some of the puts and takes and maybe what drove the increase in the earlier stage special mention in the substandard categories thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah yeah michael its john so i think we talked about a few quarters ago as the yield curve increases and rates rise well probably see a migration and a more of a normalization in particularly commercial real estate loans and thats kind of manifested itself although its slowing down in the last quarter or two but its primarily a rising rate story i think our culture as you know to be is one thats quick to downgrade and slow to upgrade but as we talked to the credit team that are analyzing these loans they dont see material loss content and were not having really any significant payment performance issues i think will mentioned it in his opening remarks past dues are only basis points and were all focused on office but the office past dues are only basis points and if you take a step back past dues in all commercial real estates loans are only basis points so i think as we move through this rate cycle weve got lots of equity strong guarantors well upgrade loans accordingly as debt service coverage has improved but we dont see loss content indiscernible particularly concerned at this point william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah michael its will ill maybe comment on provisioning cecl is always a difficult and dangerous thing to predict but the theory behind it of course is that you provision in advance recognize losses in advance and if look at our build over the last eight quarters its up about a million provision expense net of chargeoffs and so its possible moving ahead if you start to see improvements in economic forecasts we and the industry have probably followed the same practice would potentially see reserve levels continue to come down even in some cases you might see some folks chargeoffs tick up at the same time so you know cecl is a forward looking model it does incorporate some other qualitative factors associated with things in your portfolio but if economic forecasts improve from here i wouldnt necessarily see our reserve moving up at all from where it is today michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc makes a lot of sense thanks for the color and maybe just one last one from me i saw that you guys filed a fixed income in your presentation and it looks like ibtx to the extent you can comment had some subdebt thats maturing in can you just talk about why this presentation was filed and then you know any sort of comments as to what the subdebt do they expect that to just pay that down or just any comments you can give thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah all i say on that michael is that ibtx as a standalone entity has debt maturing shortly and they may or may not be opportunistic in the market to refinance it michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right ill step back thanks southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of catherine mealor of kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc it was great to see the margin come right in line with your guidance wanted to see what youre thinking about the back half of the year particularly as we push the likelihood of cuts back to the likely to december thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure catherine this is steve its probably a longer answer than youre ready for but i thought maybe i would spend a little time on this because in april just the headline is there are really no real changes to our guidance but we did have as we said a material announcement in may that were thinking about the transaction with ibtx and its accretive so it is a bit of a game changer as we kind of think about post the end of this year so i guess the first point is theres really no change to our guidance i think we said to for the full year and thats sort of where we are let me kind of try to build a bridge from where we are and kind of where were modeling were headed and its really the three assumptions around interest earning assets at billion for thats no change theres nothing changed there you know our rate forecast that we talked about in april is the same as the moodys baseline it was two cuts in and four cuts in so that has not changed and then the third big assumption is around deposit beta were on the way up and were modeling on a standalone company as on the way down and then as a pro forma company with ibtx on the way down so for the standalone company for us we would expect nim to be flat in the third quarter with the loan yields and funding costs offsetting each other and if we get a rate set in september as the market seems to indicate we would expect a to basis points improvement in the fourth quarter and then for each rate cut thereafter what we talked about before we would expect the to basis points nim increase for each of those rate cuts southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 now as we think about adding ibtx into the company when ibtx closes which we still expect that to happen in the first quarter im not sure early or late but we would expect a to basis point increase in the margin run rate for us as we marktomarket the fixed rate loans and fixed rate securities of ibtx so to just kind of conclude as we kind of think forward from the bridge from here to the end of so by the fourth quarter of with these rate assumptions and our modeling assumptions that we announced during the merger that we would approximately have about billion in loan wed have about billion in deposits and our exiting fourth quarter nim would be in the to range and then as we think about if moodys baseline is correct theres three more rate cuts in which would add to our margin that same to basis points so the area would be in get in the potentially you know if we dont get if we get fewer cuts than that were expecting we would expect margin continue to expand but it would be lower by to basis points for each rate cut that we dont get if its less than rate cuts so hopefully you know that kind of helps your modeling as you think about us on a standalone through the end of the year and then us together with ibtx through just two other comments on that as we think about liability sensitivity in a low rate environment our cre floating rate loans percentage is post itll be so little less floating in a postibtx world and then our deposits as we mentioned our beta was in a preibtx and postibtx would be so that all kind of adds up to all of those assumptions to get to that guide so i hope thats helpful catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah that was awesome steve as always and one thing you mentioned last quarter that you still thought that before we get to cuts that your deposit cost would probably peak somewhere in the mid it feels like were now so nearing that is that still how youre thinking about the deposit cost peak stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yes no change that the interest rate forecast didnt change this quarter we were i think thats whats in our press release with our deposit cost we still expect that to peak in the mid probably in the third quarter indiscernible catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp late in the third quarter excuse me catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay and then your three the guidance you gave for next year ending at to that you mentioned that of course includes accretable yield correct southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp i wouldnt call it accretable yield i would call it market rate on interest rate swap thats correct that would be in my indiscernible catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc we will back at the core stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yeah yeah just simply dont catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah but still but that includes the impact of this stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yeah thats right catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great very helpful steve thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brandon king of truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so fees came in stronger this quarter as well so just wanted to get an update on what youre thinking about fees going forward i believe the range is kind of that to basis points but i wonder if thats a to basis points but has that changed at all given the strength youve seen so far southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure thanks brandon this is steve yes you know we showed a slide on page but our fee income is just sort of a trend line on our fee income of million or basis points on assets yeah which was higher than our to basis point guide we did have interest on an irs tax refund payment that added about million to the second quarter totals so if you kind of i would say that basically theres not a lot of change to this guidance based on the interest rate forecast and the first cut that happened late in the third quarter we would sort of expect that nii average assets to be maybe in that to basis point range before it starts climbing you know as they start cutting rates and the capital markets businesses start coming back mortgage maybe in that to basis point range maybe toward the first of next year and then as we look at the prelook and as we run rate perspective when we add ibtx which has a little less noninterest income we would expect nii to average assets to be somewhere in that to basis points combined range as we get a full run rate after close brandon king q analyst truist securities inc all right thats thats very helpful and then john you mentioned in your prepared remarks that your deposit environment is still challenging and deposits declined on a spot basis quarteroverquarter so could you just further elaborate on kind of what youre seeing in the deposit environment and kind of the expectations for growth going forward stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure brandon this is steve i think where we are in the cycle is kind of right at the end of a rate pausing cycle and i remember this from other cycles that liquidity is kind of hard until the rate cutting cycle goes into place and were trying to manage obviously yield deposit cost with growth and right now were having the ability to fund our loans with our deposits and our securities balances so i would expect that ill call it at a rate cutting environment that liquidity typically comes back and money market funds theres alternatives and other things as people are in the treasuries they typically go back in the bank deposits or some portion of it so if in this environment weve been really focused on managing our own capital and trying to remix the balance sheet without growing the overall balance sheet and the overall funding structure and try to remix within that so i would expect the team certainly focused on it but were also focused on ppnr and so were trying to balance those two things brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and just lastly a clarification point on the nim guidance what is your embedded mix deposit mix expectations or assumptions within that with especially for noninterest bearing stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp yeah so our noninterest bearing in this quarter is around i think it rounded to last quarter so i think were things sort of a flattening off on a standalone basis ibtx is a little less than that but i think they saw a nice yield moderation there too so i wouldnt expect there to be a huge mix shift from here absent a rate change southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 or something like that but right now weve seen the sort of the trends and i think maybe it was down or basis points but hardly sitting around at all john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp this is around where we were precovid so you know its hard to predict when the environment we went through was different but this is pretty close to where we were precovid brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc all right thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning will you made some comments i think regarding your construction projects indiscernible youre going to maybe see that moderate or decline a little bit im curious as it relates to completed projects are you seeing any extension in terms of dwell times on your balance sheet before maybe there is a sale transaction or before the projects move to the secondary market or the permanent market john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah you know in some segments were seeing them to be a little slower to lease up selfstorage particularly what were seeing a little slowness there but on the flip side gary we are seeing the capital markets start to fall and seeing more transactions in multifamily just in the last month we saw a multifamily project trade at a i think was a of cap rate so that tells you that theres activity out there and the ability to transact business and get these projects off the books gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah appreciate the color there and then i was just curious about the intraquarter volatility on the dda balance it seemed particularly larger score of the average balance almost billion above the march or balance so just curious about that intraquarter volatility and how to think about it john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah gary our ddas as a percent of overall deposits were really flat on an average basis q1 to q2 im not sure i may have misunderstood your question southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co i guess im just querying the delta between ive got your average dda for the quarter at over billion versus about billion at quarter end and about billion as of march so i am just curious of that intraquarter volatility of average versus the period end john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah i think you may have a blip in your model we got the average for q1 was million and q2 was million so yeah and year ago june ph million per average noninterest in the quarter two maybe indiscernible william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp thats on page of the earnings release gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co no ive got those numbers guys again i was just trying to be we could i can talk to you offline about it its not a major factor here thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david bishop of hovde group please go ahead david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp hi good morning david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc a question you know theres obviously been a lot of argument around the commercial real estate space within the markets here into the deal any subsegments or areas where youre consciously pulling back from and saying hey were going to avoid this landmine just not looking to grow this business and any areas where you might see some opportunities thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024 yeah david really i dont think theres any difference in philosophy of ibtx and southstate you know i think we are wanting to manage our total cre ratio well below the and see that decline overtime you were all cautious naturally on office cautious on assisted living ibtx has got a really good solid retail granular retail cre book and were pretty bullish on that so i dont i dont anticipate a change in their lending practices or our lending practices but i do anticipate with the way were going to accrete capital that our cre concentration ratio will drift down david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it appreciate it but a housekeeping item i know obviously the profitability was great in with the merger how should we think about a goforward tax rate once the merger is complete thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp you know not im not forecasting a big change from where we are today dave ill probably have some more refined estimates as we move closer to closing and maybe better update you guys in the next couple of quarters but this at this standpoint i dont have anything any major changes to project david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it appreciate the color william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp if there are no further questions im going to add and make one clarifying comment on the noninterest expenses ive seen some of you in your notes have noted the cost of the cyber event which we have in the nonrecurring line item in that year based on about million about half of that in the first quarter and half in the second quarter we have coverage for the cyber event we have not yet filed the insurance claim we have a retention amount and then theres some amounts related to some employee payments that would tend to be covered by policy thatll be borne by us those two combined total about million so i know some of you are adding adding it back as an operating expense in some of your models but i wanted just to make that point we have yet to file that claim and would expect to be reimbursed for all but about million of the cost of that event so just fyi operator okay so yeah there are no further questions i will now turn the conference back over to mr john corbett for closing remarks john c corbett chief executive officer director southstate corp all right thank you guys for joining us this morning we know youve got a lot of calls to jump on so if we can provide any other clarity for you dont hesitate to give us a ring and i hope you have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen that concludes the conference thank you for joining you may now disconnect southstate corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2024
