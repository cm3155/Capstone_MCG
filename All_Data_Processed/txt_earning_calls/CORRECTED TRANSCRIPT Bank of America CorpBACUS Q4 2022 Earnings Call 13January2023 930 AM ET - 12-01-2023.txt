of america corp thank you lee and thank all of you for joining us this morning i am starting on slide of the earnings presentation during the fourth quarter of our team once again delivered responsible growth for our shareholders we reported billion in net income aftertax or per diluted share we grew revenue yearoveryear and delivered our sixth straight quarter of operating leverage and again we delivered a strong return on tangible common equity if you move to slide we list the highlights of the quarter which have been pretty consistent throughout the year we drove good organic customer activity and saw significant increases in net interest income which all helped drive operating leverage revenue increased yearoveryear it was led by a improvement in net interest income coupled with a strong growth in sales and trading results by jimmy demare and the team this growth well exceeded the impacts of lower investment banking fees and the impact of bond and equity market valuations on asset management fees in our wealth management business the positive contributions of nii and sales and trading were also enough to overcome a decline in service charges driven by the fully implemented changes in nsf and overdraft fees in our consumer business importantly we improved our common equity tier ratio by basis in quarter four to and we achieved that without changing our business strategies we were well above our current minimum cet1 requirement and above the requirement that well have beginning next year in january of we added to our buffer while both growing loans and reducing outstanding shares in the quarter on a yearoveryear comparative basis both net income and eps are up modestly with strong operating leverage more than offsetting higher provision expense the higher provision expense is driven primarily by reserve build this quarter result of loan growth in our portfolios and also our conservative weighting on a reserve setting methodology which ill touch on later last year we had large reserve releases net chargeoffs increased this quarter but asset quality remains strong chargeoffs are well below both the beginning of the pandemic as well as longer term historical levels and again ill touch on this in a few pages all that being said the simple way to think about it is pretax preprovision income which neutralizes these reserve actions grew yearover year lets turn to slide slide shows the yearoveryear annualized results and quarter four results were a nice finish to a successful year in which we produced billion in net income on revenue growth and a operating leverage while the year was strong full year earnings declined as a result of loan loss reserve actions for the full year of again we built about million reserves and by contrast last year in we released billion of reserves isolating those changes again youll see that ppnr grew a strong over and as i said earlier the themes were characterized by good organic customer activity strong nii and all this helped by our years of responsible growth slide highlights some of the attributes of organic growth for the quarter and the year this plus the slides that we include each earnings materials in our appendix which show digital trends and organic growth highlights across all the businesses our investments over the past several years in our people tools and resources for our bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 customers and our teammates as well as renovating our facilities have allowed us to continue to enhance the consumer experience to record high levels and fuel organic growth in the fourth quarter of we added net new checking accounts bringing the total for the year to more than million this is twice the rate of addition that we had in in periods before the pandemic this net growth has led to increase in our customer checking accounts since the pandemic while keeping that of our accounts are primary checking accounts of the household and the average opening balance not the average balance but the average opening balance for these new accounts is over we also produced more than million new credit cards the sixth consecutive quarter of doing that bringing us back to levels that we generated prepandemic credit quality you can see on appendix slides for consumer remains very high on new originations verified digital users grew to million with of our consumer households fully digitally active we have more than billion logins to our digital platforms each month and thats been going on for some time now digital sales are also growing and they now represent half of our sales in the consumer business erica our virtual digital assistant is now handling million interactions this past quarter and has passed billion interactions since its introduction just a few years ago this saves a lot of work for our team when you move to the gwim business the wealth management business our advisors grew by in the second half of the year our team added net new households across merrill and the private bank in we experienced solid net flows despite the turbulence in markets by the way during our average merrill household opened with the balances of million again very high quality account openings on flows when combined across all our investment platforms in our consumer and wealth management business we saw billion of net client flows this year additionally we continue to see increased activity around both investments in our gwim business and our banking products diversified banking element is a strong differentiator for us as a company it also supports the healthy pretax margin this helped the gwim business deliver strong operating leverage for the year and it grew net revenue and net income to records in our global banking business we saw solid loan production and growing use of our digital platforms throughout the year and added new clients to our portfolio as you well know the overall investment banking fee pool is down however we continue to deepen and expand client relationships with our buildout of commercial bankers our global treasury services business also grew revenue yearoveryear as a result of both rates as well as fees for service on cash management in global markets we had our highest quarter fourth quarter sales and trading performance on record growing from last year ex dva this was led by a strong performance in our macro ficc businesses where we made continuous investments over the past months equities had a record quarter four performance as well lets move to slide and talk about operating leverage as ive said to you for many years one of the primary goals of this company which is an important part of our shareholder return model has been to drive operating leverage those efforts including investments made for the future coupled with revenue growth produced straight quarters of operating leverage as you can see leading up to the pandemic beginning last year in the in the third quarter of i told you that weve now started achieving operating leverage and got back on streak and were six quarters of operating leverage despite all the things that are going on out there and the team continues to drive towards that for so i thought id spend a few minutes on the discussion of topics thats been important ph to as we talked about investors over the last couple of months deposits and credit so lets go to slide first on bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 deposits there are several factors impacting deposits as our industry works through and the economy works through an impressive period a surge in deposits from the pandemicrelated stimulus the impact of monetary unprecedented monetary easing the impact of high inflation and then the reversal of that with unprecedented pace and size of rate hikes and monetary tightening but on a yearonyear basis average deposits of trillion are down this reflects the market trends and in fact reflects high tax payments to the government in quarter two in addition as we moved forward through customers with excess cash investmentoriented cash saw yield as rates increased for money market funds direct treasuries and other products its probably more relevant to discuss the more nearterm trends comparing third quarter of to fourth quarter of average deposits were down noninterest bearing deposits are down while interestbearing deposits are up the mix shift is especially pronounced in treasury services in the global banking business corporate treasurers managed billion of deposits they have with us the impact of their activities has a change in the mix on the personal side you can see the checking account balances floating down a little bit from core expenses and spending while more affluent customers put money into the high yielding deposits in the market we do manage all these products differentially and the discussion of these deposits by business segment you can see on slide and well talk through that so this breaks down our deposits in a more nearterm trend in the upper left you can see the full year across the for the whole company going across the page in the upper lefthand chart we also put in the rate hikes that you can see on the chart you can see the heavy tax payment outflows in the second quarter then we saw the acceleration of rate hikes and deposits have moved to products seeking yield in certain customer segments but in large part what youve seen over the course of the quarter four has been stabilization and more normal client activity simply put we ended quarter four of with trillion in deposits roughly the overall level ph as we ended in quarter three ending deposit balances so lets look at those differentiated by business in consumer looking at the upper right chart we show the difference between the movement through the quarter between the balance of low to no interest checking accounts to somewhat higher yielding nonchecking accounts money market and savings accounts and a limited portion of cds across the quarter we saw a billion decline in total down we have seen small declines as customers continued higher levels of spending to pay down debt and also moved money to their brokerage accounts even in this business higher wages have offset this while we saw a decline in quarter four deposits in consumer correspondingly we also saw brokerage levels of consumer investments increase billion capturing a good portion of those deposits in general think of these consumer deposits being very sticky of trillion that stickiness along with net checking account growth reflect the recognition and the value proposition of the relationship transactional account with our company it also has it reflects industryleading digital capabilities we offer and the convenience of a nationwide franchise it also reflects that the customers in our mass market segments have fewer excess cash investmentstyle cash balances of the trillion in consumer deposits remain in low and no interest checking accounts and because of all of that overall rate paid in this segment remains low at basis points in wealth management which you can see at the bottom left of the chart more than billion of deposits became more stable across the fourth quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 here you also witnessed a shift to higher yielding preferred deposits as you can see on the labels from lower yielding transaction deposits as these customers have more excess cash and moved them to seek higher yields early in the quarter we saw modest declines in balances but november as rate hikes began to slow and the probability of future rate hikes became less people had moved their money and we saw an uptick in balances as we moved through the quarter this reflects the seasonal inflows that happen in the fourth quarter for wealth management clients at the bottom right chart you can see the most dynamic part of this equation our global banking deposit movement moves across billion in customer deposits the shift here is what drives the mix total for the company its pretty typical with the exception that it happened very quickly in quarter four driven by the pace of rate hikes in a rising rate environment where companys operational funds are more expensive we anticipate these changes particularly in high liquidity environments as clients use both cash for inventory yield pay down debt or manage their cash for investment yield we have seen the mix of global banking interestbearing deposits move from last quarter to in quarter four and obviously were paying higher rates on those deposits to retain them customer pricing here is on a customertocustomer basis based on the depth of relationship the product usage and many other factors so overall deposit rates paid as a percent of fed funds increases are still very favorable to last cycle even as rates are rising much faster than last cycle i would note relative to the last cycle that the fed increases have been rapid and wed expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through the end of the interest rate cycle so just remember while we are paying more for deposits we also get that on our asset side that is simply why the net interest income is up in quarter four versus quarter four now lets move to the second topic i wanted to touch on specifically which is credit and this begins on slide first it is an ineluctable truth that our asset quality of our customers remains very healthy on the other hand its impossible to gainsay that the net chargeoffs are moving to prepandemic levels so in the fourth quarter we saw net chargeoffs of million increased million from quarter three the increase was driven by both higher commercial and credit card losses but as these charts show theyre still very low in the overall context in commercial we had a few of older companyspecific loans but not related or not predictive of any broader trends in the portfolio these were already reserved for in prior periods and based on our methodologies went through chargeoff in quarter four credit card chargeoffs increased in quarter four as a result of the flowthrough of modest increase in last quarters latestage delinquencies this should continue as we transition off the historic lows in delinquencies to still very low prepandemic levels provision expense was billion in quarter four in addition to higher chargeoffs provision included a roughly million reserve build this was higher than quarter three reflecting good credit card and other loan growth combined with the reservesetting scenario so lets just stop on the reservesetting scenario our scenario our baseline scenario contemplates a mild recession thats the base case of the economic assumptions in the blue chip and other methods we use but we also add to that a downside scenario and what this results in is of our reserve methodology is weighted towards a recessionary environment in that includes higher expectations of inflation leading to depressed gdp and higher unemployment expectations this scenario is more conservative than last quarters scenario now to be clear just to give you a sense of how that scenario plays out it contemplates a rapid rise in unemployment to peak at early this year in and remain at or above all the way through the end of obviously much more conservative than the economic estimates that are out there bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 we included again the updated slides in the appendix pages and to highlight differences in our credit portfolios between prefinancial prepandemic and current status we also again gave you the new origination statistics for consumer credit on page the work the team has done on responsible growth continues to show strong results from an outsiders view you dont have to look any further than the feds stress test results weve had the lowest net chargeoffs for peer banks in out of the last stress tests on slides to we included some longerterm perspective we showed longterm trends for commercial net chargeoffs total consumer chargeoff rates and more specifically credit card chargeoff rates this compares those ratios to prefinancial crisis during the recovery after the financial crisis prepandemic and then through the pandemic so that gives you a longterm perspective which keeps in context the idea that were moving off the bottom in credit cost towards a level which is normalized into prepandemic but that level is very low in the grand context of banking so before i move it to alastair i want to just update a few comments on our consumer behavior consumer deposit balances continue to show strong liquidity with the lower cohorts of our consumers continue to hold several multiples of balances they had as the pandemic began these balances are drifting down but they still have plenty of cushion left and while their spending remains healthy weve continued to see the pace of that yearoveryear growth slow in the aggregate in our consumers spent trillion which outpaced by you can see that on slide two things to note on that consumer spending pace there continues to be a slowdown yearoveryear growth percentages earlier in were yearoveryear theyve now moved to yearoveryear in the fourth quarter so what does this mean well that level of growth in yearoveryear spending is consistent with the low inflation growth economy we saw prepandemic theyre also moving from goods to service and experience and spend more money on travel vacations and eating out and things like that that is good for unemployment but continues to maintain serviceside inflation pressure with that let me pass the mic over to alastair to go through the rest of the quarter alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp okay thanks brian and let me start with the balance sheet and ill use slide for this during the quarter our balance sheet declined billion to trillion driven by modestly lower global markets balances our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter reflecting the decrease in deposits and securities levels and at billion it still remains billion above our prepandemic levels shareholders equity increased billion from the third quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital we distributed to shareholders and roughly million in redemption of some preferred securities we paid out billion in common dividends and we bought back billion of shares which was million above those issued for employees in the quarter aoci was little changed in the quarter as a small benefit from lower mortgage rates was more than offset by change in our annual pension revaluation with regard to regulatory capital our supplementary leverage ratio increased to versus our minimum requirement of and that obviously leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements okay lets turn to slide and talk about cet1 where as you can see our capital remains strong as our cet1 level improved to billion and our cet1 ratio improved basis points to that means in the past two bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 quarters weve improved our cet1 ratio by basis points as weve added to our management buffer on top of both our current and requirements so we can walk through the drivers of the cet1 ratio this quarter and you can see earnings net of preferred dividends generated basis points common dividends used basis points and gross share repurchases used basis points and while the balance sheet was down loan growth drove a modest increase in rwa using basis points of cet1 so we were able to support our loan growth and return capital and add to our capital buffer in the same quarter lets spend a minute on the loan growth by focusing on average loans on slide and here you can see average loans grew yearoveryear driven by credit card and commercial loan improvement on a more nearterm linked quarter basis loans grew at a slower annualized pace just driven by credit card the credit card growth reflects increased marketing enhanced offers and reopening of our financial centers delivering higher levels of account openings mortgage balances were up modestly yearoveryear and linked quarter were driven by slower prepayments commercial growth reflects a good balance of global markets lending as well as commercial real estate and to a lesser degree custom lending in our private bank and merrill businesses turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in q4 was billion and the fte nii number was billion focusing on fte net interest income increased billion from q4 of or driven by a few notable components first nearly billion of the yearoveryear improvement in nii was driven by interest rates yearoveryear the average fed funds rate has increased basis points driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets relative to that fed funds move the rate paid on our total deposits increased basis points to ph and focusing just on interestbearing deposit rates paid the increase is ph basis points so even while fed funds rates have increased basis points more than the last cycle at this point our cumulative passthrough percentage rates still remain lower in this cycle that includes an increase in the pass through rates in the past days due to the unprecedented period of rate hikes included in the rate benefit was a billion improvement in the quarterly securities premium amortization longterm interest rates on mortgages have increased basis points from the fourth quarter of which has driven down refinancing of mortgage assets and therefore slowed the recognition of premium amortization expense recognized in our securities portfolio the second contributor is loan growth net of securities paydowns and thats added nearly million to the yearoveryear improvement and lastly partially offsetting the banking book nii growth just described was higher funding costs for our global markets inventory now that is passed on to clients through our noninterest market making line so its revenueneutral to both sales and trading and to total revenue and as you can see in our material global markets nii is down million yearoveryear okay turning to a linked quarter discussion nii is up million from the third quarter driven largely by interest rates that million increase included a million decline in our global markets nii the net interest yield was and that improved basis points from the fourth quarter of nearly of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter with the primary driver being the benefit from higher interest rates which includes a basis point benefit from lower premium amortization as you will note excluding global markets our net interest yield was up basis points to bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 looking forward i would make a couple of comments as i do every quarter let me provide the important caveats regarding our nii guidance our caveats include assumptions that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and we anticipate card loans will decline seasonally from holiday spend paydowns and otherwise we expect modest loan growth we expect a seasonal decline in global banking deposits and that the other deposit mix shifts experienced in q4 may continue into the first quarter in the face of more rate hikes we also expect the funding costs for global markets to continue to increase based on higher rates and as noted the impact of that is recognized and offset in noninterest income so its revenue neutral so starting with the fourth quarter nii of billion and assuming a decline of roughly million of global markets nii in q1 which would be similar to the fourth quarter decline that would get us to a q1 number around billion in addition we have to factor in two last days of interest which is about million so that would lower our starting point to billion we believe the core banking book will continue to show the benefit of rates and other elements and can offset most of the day count so were expecting q1 nii to be somewhere around billion beyond q1 with increases in rates slowing and if balances continue their recent stabilization trends we expect less variability in nii for the balance of okay lets turn to expense and well use slide for the discussion q4 expenses were billion and they were up million from q3 driven by an increase in our people and technology costs in addition we also saw higher costs from our continued return to work and travel and costs of client engagement weve seen pentup demand for our teams gathering back together in person to drive collaboration and to spend more time with our clients inflationary pressures continued but our operational excellence improvements as well as the benefits of a more digitized customer base helped offset those pressures our head count this quarter increased by from q3 and as we faced increased attrition in our teams were quite successful in their hiring efforts to continue to support customers as the attrition slowed in the fall our accelerated pace of hiring outpaced attrition leaving us with growth in our head count as we look forward to next quarter i would just remind everyone that q1 typically includes million to million in seasonally elevated payroll taxes and q1 will also be the first quarter to include the costs of the late october announcement by regulators of higher fdic insurance costs and as a result of holding the leadership share in us retail deposits that will add million to each of our quarterly costs or a total of million for the year we expect these things will put expenses around billion in the first quarter before expectations that they should trend back down again over the course of on asset quality we highlight credit quality metrics on slide for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and since brian already covered much of the topics on asset quality im going to move to a discussion of our line of business results starting with consumer on slide brian noted the earlier organic growth across checking accounts card accounts and investments were strong again this quarter and thats as a result of many years of retooling and continuous investments in the business so let me offer some highlights at this point we have the leading retail deposit market share we have leadership positions among the most important products for consumers and were the leading digital bank with convenient capabilities for consumer bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 and small business clients we also have a leading online consumer investment platform and a great small business platform offering for our clients and importantly when you combine all these capabilities with improved service at this point customer satisfaction is now at alltime highs and we produced another strong quarter of results in consumer banking that resulted in billion in net income in for the quarter consumer banking earned billion on good organic growth and delivered its seventh consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continued to invest for the future note that our top line grew while expense grew the earnings impact of yearoveryear revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in provision expense and that provision increase reflects reserve builds this period compared to a reserve release in the fourth quarter of net chargeoffs increased as a result of the card chargeoffs that brian noted earlier while this quarters reported earnings were up yearoveryear pretax preprovision income grew an even stronger yearoveryear so that highlights the earnings improvement without the impact of the reserve actions revenue improvement reflects the fuller value of our deposit base as well as deepening with our deposit relationships id note the growth also includes a decline in service charges of million yearoveryear as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect by the end of q2 of this year and as a result of those policy changes we continue to benefit from the better overall customer satisfaction and the corresponding lower attrition and the lower costs associated with fewer customer complaint calls obviously as a result of fewer fees the increase in expenses reflects business investments for growth including people and technology along with costs related to reopening the business to fuller capacity and remember much of the companys minimum wage hikes and quarter two increased salary and wage moves impacts consumer banking the most of our lines of business and therefore impacts most the yearoveryear comparisons we also continued our investment in financial centers for the year we opened and we renovated more and against all of that both digital banking and operational excellence helped us to pay for investments and that allowed us to improve the efficiency ratio to an impressive basis point improvement over the yearago period before moving away from consumer banking i want to note some differences to highlight just how much more effectively and efficiently this business is running since even just before the pandemic its easy to lose sight of how well this business is operating from an already strong position in and you can see some of the stats on slide in the appendix we can best summarize by noting weve got billion more in deposits more checking customers of whom are primary more investment accounts and absent the card divestitures weve increased the amount of new card accounts by and our payment volumes are higher were servicing those customers with fewer financial centers because of our digital capabilities and its allowed us to need fewer people to run the business bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 our combined credit and debit spend was up digital sales increased and we sent and received three times the number of zelle transactions all of this allowed us to run the business with fewer employees and lower our cost of deposits ratio below basis points moving to slide wealth management produced strong results earning billion on good revenue and profit margin this led to full year records for both revenue and net income of billion and billion respectively this was an especially good result given the nearly unprecedented negative returns of both the equity and the bond markets at the same time this year the volatility and generally lower market levels put pressure on certain revenues in this business again in q4 but what helps differentiate merrill and the private bank is a strong banking business at scale with billion of deposits and billion of loans so despite a decline in asset under management and brokerage fees yearoveryear we saw our revenues hold flat with the fourth quarter of our talented group of wealth advisors coupled with powerful digital capabilities generated net new households in merrill in the fourth quarter while the private bank gained an impressive net new high net worth relationships in the quarter both were up nicely from net household generation in we added billion of loans in this business since q4 of growing and marking the 51st consecutive quarter of average loan growth in the business despite securitiesbased lending reductions related to the current market environment thats consistent and sustained performance by the teams our expenses declined driven by lower revenuerelated incentives partially offset by investments in our business moving to global banking on slide and you can see the business earned billion in the fourth quarter on record revenues of billion pretty remarkable given the decline in investment banking fees during this year lower investment banking fees higher credit costs and a modest increase in expenses were mostly offset by stronger nii and other fees so overall revenue grew reflecting the value of our global transaction service business to our clients and our associated revenue growth while investment banking fees declined a little more than the companys overall investment banking fees were billion in q4 declining billion yearoveryear in a continued tough market still we increased our ranking in overall fees for the full year to number three as weve continued to invest in the business the million increase in provision expense reflected a modest reserve build of million in the fourth quarter compared to a million release in the yearago period and pretax preprovision income grew yearoveryear expense increased yearoveryear and that was driven by strategic investments in the business including hiring and technology switching to global markets on slide and as we usually do ill talk about the segment results excluding dva you can see our fourth quarter record results were a very strong finish to a good year the continued themes of inflation geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe continued to drive volatility in both the bond and equity markets and repositioning from our clients and as a result it was another quarter that favored macro trading while our credit trading businesses improved also as spreads fared better than the prior year the fourth quarter net income of million reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue partially offset by lower shares of investment banking revenue and its worth noting that this net income excludes million of dva losses this quarter as a result of our own credit spread movements reported net income was million bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 focusing on yearoveryear sales and trading contributed billion to revenue and that improved thats a new fourth quarter record for this business besting the previous one by and its billion in sales and trading for the year it marked the best in more than a decade ficc improved while equities was up compared to the quarter a yearago and the ficc improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products while credit products also improved from a weaker q4 environment weve been investing continuously over the past year in our macro businesses weve identified those as opportunities for us and again weve been rewarded for that this quarter yearoveryear expense increased about primarily driven by investments in the business finally on slide we show all other which reported a loss of million and that was consistent with the yearago period for the quarter the effective tax rate was approximately benefiting from esg investment tax credits and certain discrete tax benefits excluding those discrete items our tax rate would have been and further adjusting for the tax credits it would have been our full year gaap tax rate was and we would not expect to be a lot different so with that well stop here and well open it up please for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much i need a little more help you gave a lot but i need a little more help on nii for you walked us to the billion on starting point on the quarter and your words were less variability in nii for the rest of so i guess my question is you got a lot of loan growth you have a few more rate hikes hopefully coming through and i understand the opposite the flipside of that is deposit migration some outflows and betas but could you fill in those blanks because i think and i wont speak for everybody else i know i was still expecting some growth in nii for the calendar year so maybe you could talk through some of those pieces and maybe the outflow in global banking noninterestbearing is a big piece of it so thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp glenn ill start with just just by way of context obviously were coming off a period with historic inflows for pandemic deposits and now in q4 were beginning to see the impact of quantitative tightening and a number of sharp rate rises so that obviously creates some uncertainty we dont necessarily have a playbook for that weve just got to see how actual balances perform and weve got to see how the rotation and the rate paid develop so its dynamic its evolving and we manage and we forecast that weekly so when we lay out for you the actuals on page and of the earnings presentation were trying to show you what were seeing in real time around balances and mix so what weve said with respect to this quarter coming up is weve got to adjust for the day count as we would every year thats timing and well get that back obviously in q2 and q3 and then we highlighted the global bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 markets nii impact its always been there the last couple quarters its been around million it is revenue neutral to shareholders as we point out because we pass that along to clients and we capture it elsewhere in sales and trading but it does obviously impact the nii thats why were highlighting it but as it relates to the forecast look we feel like the modest balance declines are kind of in there that may continue and this continued rotation from some of the noninterestbearing to interestbearing we got some pricing and rate pressures so thats in the back of our mind too and the only final thing ill just say is were reluctant to go a whole lot further out last year we declined to give a full year guide this year we feel that way in particular because its just a much more sensitive environment when were modeling when interest rates are at than when they were at basis points so for all those reasons now i will say this just as a final point weve just got to i think we got to stay patient because we got to see how rates and balances and rotation shake out and as rates return to more normal and as customer behavior and you can sort of see it its behaving maybe a little more normally then we should be able to resume our upward path over time but we got to see how this shakes out and thats why we dont want to go out beyond q1 at this stage glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi fair enough i feel bad for all of us maybe a quick one on credit good to see chargeoffs down given everything thats going on in the world but can you talk through the big the billion sequential pickup in criticized books from last quarter whats driving that and how you feel about reserves against that thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so youre aware the main driver there is commercial real estate and its specifically around about billion of it is office obviously theres a significant amount of change going on in office and what weve chosen to do is as rates are rising here were pushing that through the models and just with the debt service coverage it comes down we push through the downgrade so weve chosen to do that the performance is still okay so were not concerned with the performance but were just making sure were being tight on the modeling there it is obviously a portfolio where i think you know this were pretty focused on making originations into office buildings that are leased up generally at ltv at origination and of that book is class a office buildings so were not alarmed there were just following our own process with respect to making sure were current on the debt service coverage glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much appreciate it brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp just remember that were talking about office with very highquality underwriting characteristics all a class etcetera and so we just have a conservative rating process frankly and its well viewed out there and well looked at by many people but remember office is billion to billion of the total portfolio so we feel very comfortable where we are bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 and then obviously weve built reserves against the portfolios across the board that are strong and reflect the as i said earlier basically a mild recession in the base case and a worse recession in the adverse case that we weight operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets thank you alastair on the loan loss reserving and brian just talked about the adverse case being about can you guys share with us how much of the reserve building is what may be referred to as management overlay relative to what the models are specifically dictating on reserve building brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp we dont disclose that but you might assume that theres a fair amount there are three components to this one is what the models say two is basically uncertainty in precision and another thing is we overlay and then a judgmental and you might think that theres a fair amount of that right now with the uncertainty but so the model piece of that would be a portion of it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets very good brian and then when you look at your deposit behavior of the consumer to past cycles is there any material differences in the way theyre moving money around or not moving money around from their checking accounts or lowyielding savings accounts brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp i think when you look at the higherend consumer not really they move to when the rate in the market yields money market funds we move them to it and thats part of what we do in that sort of investment cash gerard as we call it moves the checking accounts dont move the difference frankly is that there was a lot of stimulus that was in addition to the earnings power of a consumer so weve never had that in history but and so that amount of stimulus is the question is will they spend it down or will they keep storing it up and theyve been spending it down very modestly across sort of medium income households or so and the general consumer business to give you an example the cohort that was to in average balances prepandemic had theyre still sitting at but they peaked in early at so theyre drifting down but its still multiples the big question is will they end up spending that down if theyre employed probably not but if the unemployment rate changes and our models assume the unemployment rate changes so i think were at basis points now in total consumer rate paid the rate structures very high and were basis points is where we got to we have very low cd volumes and things have a fair amount of money markets but most of its checking thats why we showed you the differential on checking bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 so is it different yeah probably in a mass consumer business just because they were sitting on more cash and may use that cash in certain scenarios but the rest of the behaviors largely the same including in the corporate business where people can have less balances and the effective credit rate generates a bigger number to cover their fees so they tend to pull the balances out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets just quickly brian when you look at the high net worth and corporate did that move to from zero to fed funds for example versus to where we are today at is most that have completed where the people that were going to move the money have already moved it in those two categories brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp well i mean i cant say definitively but youve seen thats where we showed you on those pages where we showed the account balances are relatively stable in wealth management in the fourth quarter 300odd billion basically theyre flat if you look across the last several weeks so theres always a little bit of migration to the preferred deposit which is a market for higheryielding sort of money market account but the big shift in that was frankly in the second quarter of when i think we had billionodd numbers of tax payments which was a lot higher than in past years due to if you think about the dynamic in capital gains and those things that went through so what were seeing is the last four or five weeks were seeing relatively stable in deposit balances quarterend three quarterend four basically flat a little bit of movement among the categories but in that business frankly a fairly sort of stable place right now and so i think the long answer the short answer if they move the money theyve kind of already moved it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets brian thank you very much operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess alastair i guess no good deed goes unpunished i mean nii did grow for the year it did grow linked quarter in the fourth quarter up million but six weeks after you gave the guidance last quarter you lowered that guidance by million and it just raised some questions about the quality of your modeling or if you had your arms completely around the asset liability management so what happened to cause you to change that guidance albeit in the context of still some of the best nii growth you guys have seen in many years alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so mike if i go back to six months ago quarter two earnings what we said at the time was we thought over the course of the next six months nii might go up by billion in actual fact its gone up billion so thats the actuals and were forecasting as best we can at any given time up billion q3 was more bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 favorable than i think we had thought and q4 was less favorable and the q4 was less favorable in large part because the balances behaved just a little bit differently and the rate paid behaved just a little bit differently and the mix or rotation if you like that behaved a little differently and it kind of makes sense because q4 is where qt kind of kicked in so look we dont have a great deal of precedent its obviously a historic period its difficult to forecast quarterto quarter and its our models are just a lot more sensitive right now so i think were going to try and share with you what we know when we know it but its just a more difficult environment at this point to predict looking forward michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc appreciate it its like the first half indiscernible you played well you should have just stopped after then i guess but i guess as we look so in other words that million extra that you got youre kind of giving back here from the fourth to the first quarter so billion nii guide if you annualize that that would be still nii growth in is that a fair starting point can you give us not big confidence but a little confidence given that deposits have stabilized the day count cards are seasonally lower so again if you annualize that thats nii growth and then brian still on expenses any change there or are you going to keep it to just like growth brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so on the first thing mike there was something i was going to pick up on earlier to the first question you picked up going to point we will have growth in nii yearoveryear in the range you talked about if you take the billion as alastair said we expect it to sort of be less variability and annualize that compare that to of as you said so youre exactly right so thats good growth and i think youll see as you move through the year of leave aside the economic scenario playing out that youll see youll move from where we are today which is uncertainty about where the balances will finally settle in and the plateauing of those balances to where you get back to normalized growth and normalized loan growth et cetera so youve got it right therell be nice nii growth yearoveryear on the expenses if you look at your guys estimates for billion which is what we sort of said earlier in the fourth quarter were comfortable with that thats what the average of the street analysts are in that but that takes a lot of good management to get there and well continue to work on it and letting the head count drift back down and continue to invest in things that provide efficiency so youve got it and key to that is the six quarters of operating leverage and the idea of continuing that going michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then the last part of the income or the eps is simply your excess capital which you highlighted it seems like youre well above your cet1 ratio so what does that mean for the pace of buybacks and your desire to buy back stock at this price brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so weve always said that the first desire is always to support business growth and thats what weve been doing we then were well above our minimums were on a path to close out the requirement for next year and so we bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 bought back a chunk of shares this quarter expect that to start to increase neutralizing the employee issuances and then going above that each quarter now because we at 112something were close to target so were back in the game michael mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning alastair i know were asking you to predict a lot of things here just thinking about the credit and the pace of normalization do you have any sense of where chargeoffs kind of might start out the year and what kind of pace of normalization if we look at the chargeoff ratio that moved up a little bit this quarter what might that look like for alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so were not going to look too far into the future john but if you look at our days past due in the credit card data that we show you every quarter that tends to give you a pretty good leading indicator of whats coming down next quarter so you can see that the days past due have picked up just a little bit the days past due have picked up just a little bit were still well below where we were prepandemic but that would tell you on the consumer side it looks like its drifting just a little higher so thats number one number two with respect to commercial this quarter was a little unusual we had three deals that we ended up having to charge off not correlated in any way theyre in totally different businesses and theyve been hanging around for a while but it was two of them are fully reserved so they didnt come as a surprise but i think that because the commercial stuff was so close to zero it immediately looks like a pop in any given number thats part of the reason why we showed those graphs of what chargeoffs have looked like over time in the earnings materials but the commercial portfolio continues to look very strong john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and you touched on this a little bit in brians comments but just on loan growth what are you guys thinking about for this year and whats the perspective of where you closed the spigots a little bit in the third quarter as you managed rwa you kind of said those were opening up in the fourth but we didnt really see it translate to robust loan growth just kind of that dynamic between what youre looking to do and what youre seeing on demand for loan growth outlook thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so we said were wide open for business in the fourth quarter and that remains the case brian covered the capital point we had to do what we had to do in the third quarter we did it weve added basis points of capital in the last two quarters it puts us in a great place so mainly what youre seeing in q4 is just it was a slower environment for loan growth a year ago we were talking about the fact we anticipated that loan growth bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 might be high singledigits and we grew this year we feel like its going to be mid singledigits its going to be slower and its going to be led by commercial itll be led by card but things like securities based lending thats just quieter now weve got balances being paid down there mortgage is quieter this year and then in our base case you look at the economic bluechip consensus you can see the forecast is for a recession so itll be a quieter loan growth year this year i suspect but were open for business to support our clients john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thats helpful thank you operator well go next to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi good morning i just had one compound clarifying question the first is brian did you in response to mikes questions on nii bless billion in nii for right he was saying times nii growth you seem to be going with it i just wanted to confirm that i think theres a bit of confusion given that you guys were saying you dont want to go beyond the first quarter and the second question is also for you brian i think that youve done an unbelievable job of transforming the company and i think the one thing that remains is that the investor base still thinks you as mostly a bank to invest in when rates are going up right and clearly theres a lot of uncertainty over the nii outlook but could you sort of give us what we should be potentially excited about that you can control with regards to the revenue trajectory from here and also you spent so much time on deposits im just kind of confused on the message in terms of deposit declines from here because youve laid out this case that you have this very resilient deposit base and it seems like a lot of attrition has already happened so that feel sorry that was actually three questions in one i apologize but thats it brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp i think ill put all those questions together in one answer if you go to the page thats in the report where we sort of say look at the difference between the consumer business in and now and its something to be excited about because we have during a period of time where we were completely shut down in branches like opened back up we actually went down from branches to branches we built out in a lot of new cities we ph did all those work we have more checking accounts the customer favorability is an alltime high our small business part of that business is the biggest in the country and growing and you look at that and that provides a great anchor which provides that great stable deposit base we show you on the slide where we show that base it also provides a lot of very lowcost deposits and as rate rise and materialize that and then if you think what happened last cycle for a year when rates did not move up we continued to grow deposits in the consumer business in the mid singledigits which just is infinite leverage and so thats something to be excited about from not only the customer side where were digitized and zelle usage is bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 going up erica usage is going up erica meaning our erica not you erika but the and the balances of consumer investments open up more accounts in a year where investment world was choppy and then you pair that into the wealth management business same thing one of the biggest deposit franchise in the country biggest 3pointsomethingtrillion high3 trillion of assets growing net households at the fastest rate its grown in a long long time maybe history growing advisors those are things to get excited thats the organic growth engine of the company you got to put that against the backdrop of a plateauing of nii which is basically what alastair said sort of think about a less favorability around the billion starting number which mike annualized and did math and so he did the math and made it out but that provides us a good base of which to drive forward and so youve really got to get through the economic uncertainty and then all those things will start to bear meanwhile the trading business which we invested in a couple of years ago now has had its best fourth quarter ever and jimmy and the team are doing a good shape and so i we just feel good about the overall franchise more customers more with each customer and then that provides a big stable base which as rate increases slow down the marginal impact of it will slow down until we see the good core loan and deposit growth which you saw after the last rate rising increase stopped and produced the quarters of operating leverage and things like that so thats pretty good to be excited about biggest bank growing its franchise in the only growing solid economy in the world at a faster rate than everybody else is pretty interesting erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc just to clarify brian you mentioned the plateauing of nii and then hopefully all the investments in the business would drive growth from there is that still possible if we have continued rate cuts through brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp the scenario of rate cuts and rate rises we basically use bluechip so im not sure it depends on whats causing that so if its a normalization of the rate curve back to say on the frontend and on the back end or something like that thats different than what you saw when they had to cut rates for the pandemic or after the financial crisis and left them there for years to get the engine of the united states economy restarted whats different this time frankly and thats why were talking about the consumer data is even with a strong rise in interest rates a less tight labor market and inflation and what people are being told to worry about youre actually seeing consumer spending consistent with a good growth environment a low inflation environment which is good because the consumer is being appropriately conservative right now alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp erika the other thing id just say is you think about why weve got a slowdown in some of our feebased businesses right now its because rates have risen so quickly and thats created a lot of volatility and its created the asset management business thats had a big selloff in bonds and stocks so were poised now in a lower base where we can grow from here same thing if you look at our net income weve really outrun a pretty historic decline in investment banking fees so we got a diversified set of businesses where as some normalcy returns we can see some pickup in those fee lines as well bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you very much operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you good morning i wanted to follow up alastair you had about million of incremental interest income from the securities book and im just wondering if you can help us understand how much of that was attributed to the continued benefit from the swap portfolio and also then how would you expect that to impact your outlook for the billion in the first quarter guide thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so most of the increase in securities portfolio were not really reinvesting in there at this point as the securities portfolio is sort of declining were using the money thats throwing off to put it into loans thats always our first preferred place so youre picking up on the right thing its mainly the treasuries that are in there theyre swapped to floating that way we dont have any capital impact from rising rates and so youre going to see the securities yield just continue to pick up number one based off of the treasuries swap to floating as floating rates go higher and number two as the securities come due therell be fewer and fewer of them at lower rates and so youre going to see the pickup over time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and just as a followup whats our best benchmark rate to kind of watch that trajectory for how we can understand that helper from that swap portfolio alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp normally its sofr secured overnight financing rate ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great second quick one just on capital you had basis points increase in your cet1 you did billion or so of the buyback just wondering how youre thinking about capital return with the ph bar package of rules still ahead of us going forward thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think brian said the right things the strategy hasnt changed weve got to number one support our clients were going to number two invest in our growth then we plan to just sustain and grow our dividend and over time well balance building capital and buying back shares i think the difficult part with basel iii endgame right now is we dont have the rules bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 so we got to wait i think until we see those theyll go through a comment period at that point well offer much more perspective but ill say the obvious banks have got plenty of capital we were asked to take basis points more in june theres a lot of procyclicality already in things like the stress test and stress capital buffer and in cecl and i think look weve shown our ability to perform and build capital in this case basis points in two quarters so well deal with whatever the ultimate rules come out with ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you alastair operator our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning have you guys thought about how to better insulate yourself against potentially lower rates and not just kind of a little bit of a decline but if we get something unusual and rates drop a lot i know its easier for some of the smaller banks to do it but we have seen some regional banks essentially trying to lock in a corridor of the nim so that kind of medium term its more about growing the balance sheet versus the rate moves up and down and clearly with your deposit rates low if we do get fed cuts theres just not much levers to bring down those rates alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so i dont know that weve thought about it in terms of like a corridor of nim but we definitely think about balancing earnings and capital and liquidity through the cycle so i dont see us making significant changes to our core were trying to make sure that we operate and deliver in all rate environments that can be high or two years ago it can be zero rate environment so the changes were you can sort of see our changes at the margin you can see were taking securities out and replacing them with loans and you can see everything restriking higher so weve got a smaller more efficient balance sheet we at the margin may consider fixing some rates here depending on how things develop over the quarter but its weve had a pretty id say good strategy thats allowed us to drive net interest yields you can see those on page theyre up over the course of the past year and drive the nii thats up billion yearoveryear so we feel like weve struck that balance thats what responsible growth means to us and at the margin well probably still maintain a little bit of asset sensitivity matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you thats it for me operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning can you hear me alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes we can betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great two questions one just a little more color on the loan growth outlook i heard you on expecting that loan growth will be slowing as you go through the year and i just wanted to get an understanding of is that more just demand slowing base effects or is there also anything in there from you on proactive credit decisioning as normalization comes through the rest of the year brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so betsy a couple of things if you look in the fourth quarter if you can see the cards come up which is seasonal and thats going to come down and thats one of the things that people tend to pay those down the usage of those cards frankly are still at low levels the pay rate the other way to think about that is still in the so thats sort of one thing thats been kind of consistent through the pandemic the customers are paying down the card balances and youd expect at some point those will get back to more normalized paydown rate in the mid the second is line usage frankly has also come back down its not gotten ever back to where it was pre pandemic and it moved up and it dropped by or so basis points which across a lot of lines is a fair amount of loans so that you saw and so how corporates manage their borrowing and cash and demand cycle seems to be flattening out a little bit then obviously acquisitions and things are way slowed down so there wasnt much activity there so i think you put it together then you have in the securitiesbased business customers took down leverage paid off a fair amount of loans in the wealth management business even though theyve grown i think for 50some quarters in a row now or something like that in loan balances it just happens mortgages obviously are low but what we think is as the rate environment settles in youll see that normalize and that well get back well be back on the midsingledigits we just wont have the loan growth yearoveryear because that is ph faster than the economy and faster than we do we have not changed credit underwriting standards and you can see that in the consistency of the origination standards back in the pages of the appendix where we show sort of our cars and home equity and things like that its just the demand side is a little soft because people are reading the same headlines were all reading about a recession is coming and what should and they should be careful betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it and then on the expense side i know we talked a lot about the nii and the puts and takes as you go through the year that youre looking for what about stability on the expense line to manage through any worse thanexpected outcomes on the nii what kind of levers do you think you have to pull there brian bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp well we always have the variable compensation stuff will drop because assuming that the reason why rates are being cut is because economic activity is worse than people thought and then you have the general just efficiency movements in the house that we are weve been pretty good at and then you have to remember we try to get people to go off of nominal expense to operating leverage and so we have six quarters of operating leverage as the nii growth slows down we have to manage the company to produce operating leverage and so wed expect that fees might stabilize and absorb the billion downdraft in quarterly investment banking fees and start to work up from there in other types of things so i think we feel very good about the ability to find ways to manage expenses always have we slowed down hiring as we came into the fourth quarter not because were because frankly wed gotten our hiring to match the great resignation earlier in the year and it was sort of overachieving so we slowed that down and that allowed us to get back in line and start to bring the head count back down to where we want it to be but those are frankly are positions that are relatively have a relatively high movement rate ph and only because of the nature of the job so we feel good about between variable rate compensation between continuing to reduce head count for efficiency and frankly just activity levels in a down scenario well be able to pull the expenses down but meanwhile were going to invest billion in technology development in versus billion in we continue to add bankers we added wealth management advisors in the second half of last year our training program for those across all our wealth management businesses and other training programs we continue to hire young talented people so were trying to maintain that balance of continuing to invest in the growth opening in new cities were averaging these branches that were opening are extremely successful when you look at the size of them relative to anybody elses opening practice and so why would you stop that and yet the total number of branches comes down because were managing the expense side so were paying for the stuff as we go but and so you could slow some of that down and get leverage out of it but the question would be as were in that scenario is that the right decision for longterm value creation betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you operator well go next to vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you couple of clarifications on the same nii question i just want to understand in your assumption about the staying at billion through the year on a quarterly basis are you assuming deposits to continue growing or shrinking number one are you expecting further rotation out of noninterestbearing to interestbearing and do you expect the billion number even if there are rate cuts towards the end of the year is that number doable even with that what is it that youre assuming is it even with rate cuts bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so vivek we just said thered be less variability around that number due to the fact the market stuff has gone to zero has no impact on it that you saw over the last few quarters have impact so less variability all the things you cited are the reasons why we tend to say you have to be careful about saying whats going to happen in the fourth quarter of with great clarity what we did say is if at this level with less variability youll have nice growth over this year to next year but i think everything you point out whether its rates going up faster than people think because inflation indiscernible or come down because people think that theyve done a good job and they want to get behind the economy we base our modeling on the bluechip economic assumptions out there and then looking at our balances and stuff and so i think thats the reluctance so all your points are great points and theyre always why we are reluctant to say i can tell you to the three decimal places what its going to be three quarters out because it can move around on you and to mikes earlier point we grew billion and million in linked quarter and somehow people thought that wasnt good enough because theres math that would have gotten you different so stay tuned well tell you what we know when we know it and but its good organic customer growth million net new checking accounts starting at balances growth in wealth management and loans and deposit these are things that stick with you and will be good no matter what the scenario vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah another a different question slightly you gave the to deposit cohort brian in terms of where they are in the deposit balances in the past youve also given a cohort below that like a 1000type cohort where does how is that doing can you give any numbers on that brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp its similar theyre all moving down very slightly that average balance for that same group of customers taken out id say so its in the same sort of different sizing but its the same thing i dont have it right in front of the me but ill have lee get it to you but its moving down slightly the interesting part of that vivek honestly is in the highest average balances you actually have seen them down from prepandemic which means you saw them reposition that in the market so going to the earlier question we may have seen a lot of that already take place but i think its been down slightly quarteroverquarter in that cohort vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator we have no further questions in queue at this time id like to turn the program back over to brian moynihan for any additional or closing remarks brian t moynihan chair chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 thank all of you good quarter to finish and thank you to our teammates for producing it we continue to grow earnings yearoveryear we have good organic growth and operating leverage for the sixth straight quarter those will continue in the asset quality in the company continues to remain at historic lows relative to any normalized time period in the companys history including the strong credit performance we had just leading into the pandemic so our job is now to drive what we can control which is the organic growth of the franchise the investments that we make are bearing fruit and also to keep the expenses in good control and we plan to do that in thank you and we look forward to talking to you next quarter operator this does conclude todays program thank you for your participation you may
