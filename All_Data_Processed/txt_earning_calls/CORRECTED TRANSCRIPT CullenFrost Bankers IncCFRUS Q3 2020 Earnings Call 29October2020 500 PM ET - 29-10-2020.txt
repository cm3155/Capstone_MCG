thanks for joining us today ill review third quarter results for cullenfrost and our chief financial officer jerry salinas will also provide additional comments before we open it up to your questions in the third quarter cullenfrost earned million or per share compared with earnings of million or per share reported in the same quarter last year and million or per share in the second quarter of this year overall average loans in the third quarter were billion up by from billion in the third quarter of last year which included the impact from ppp loans however even excluding this impact loans managed a increase from a year earlier average deposits in the third quarter were billion also up by from the billion in the third quarter of last year and the highest quarterly average deposits in our history we understand that the banking industry has seen broad increases in deposit levels as authorities implemented comprehensive fiscal and monetary responses to the pandemic however its also been our experience that frost has historically been a safe place in times of uncertainty and i believe this will always be a part of our growth in challenging times for the first time our total assets have surpassed billion up in the last years and all of that representing organic growth and speaking of organic growth ill discuss our houston expansion in more detail later in the call but id like to point out that we were pleased to see our deposit market share in houston has now moved up to number up from 10th place a year ago even with the challenging environment we and others in our industry have seen pressure on profitability our return on assets in the third quarter was just below at and we were pleased to announce yesterday the action of our board to increase our dividend for the 26th consecutive year we saw a reduction in credit cost expense to million in the third quarter down from million in the second quarter of this compared with million in the third quarter of last year net chargeoffs for the third quarter were million down sharply from the million in the second quarter and included no energy chargeoffs annualized net chargeoffs for the third quarter were basis points of average loans nonperforming assets were million at the end of the third quarter compared to million at the end of the second quarter and million at the end of the third quarter last year the third quarter increase resulted primarily from the addition of an energy service company overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the third quarter were million or basis points of period end loans those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to what weve experienced in the past several years regarding payment deferrals in total we granted 90day deferrals to more than borrowers for loans totaling billion at the end of the third quarter there were around loans totaling million in deferment or about total problem loans which we define as ph risk rate and higher were million at the end of the third quarter compared to million at the end of the second quarter energyrelated problem loans were million at the end of the third quarter compared to million for the previous quarter and million for the third quarter last year to put that in perspective the yearend total problem energy loans totaled nearly million energy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to of our nonppp portfolio at the end of the third quarter as a reminder the peak was back in oil prices have stabilized from the volatile levels that we saw earlier in the year and we continued to moderate our companys exposure to the energy segment through the first nine months of this year the pandemics economic impacts on our portfolio have been negative but manageable during our last two conference calls we discussed the nonenergy portfolio segments that have had an increased impact from the economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic namely restaurants hotels entertainment cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 and sports and retail the total of these portfolio segments excluding ppp loans represented billion at the end of the third quarter and our loan loss reserve for these segments was new relationships are up by compared with this time last year largely because of our strong efforts and reputation for success in helping small businesses get ppp loans the dollar amount of new loan commitments booked through september is up by about compared to the prior year regarding new loan commitments booked the balance between these relationships has stayed steady at large and core so far in the market remains competitive and in fact seems to be getting more or so for instance the percentage of deals lost to structure increased from this time last year to this year its good to see that in this environment our weighted current active loan pipeline in the third quarter was up compared with the second quarter of this year consumer banking continues to see growth although it slowed somewhat by the effects of the pandemic overall net new customer growth for the third quarter was down compared with the third quarter of for consumers samestore sales as measured by account openings were down by through the end of the third quarter when compared with the third quarter of in the third quarter of our account openings came from our online channel which includes our frost bank mobile app and online account openings were higher compared to the third quarter of our investments in enhancing our mobile and online experience proved timely during the quarantine the consumer loan portfolio was billion at the end of the third quarter up by compared to the third quarter of last year our growth is being driven primarily by consumer real estate loans our houston expansion continues on pace with five new financial centers opened in the third quarter for a total of of the planned new financial centers we expect to open two more in this quarter with the remaining three opening in early the fact that weve been able to continue our expansion plans through the pandemic and see very promising results is due to the dedication and skill of frost bankers and theyve done a miraculous what merely seems extraordinary tends to be taken for granted but i want to acknowledge the commitment to the frost philosophy and culture that our people have maintained during what has been a very unusual year of course we realize the pressures impacting the banking industry in light of the current and projected economic and interest rate environment and the importance of operating as efficiently as possible while providing the level of worldclass customer service frost is known for im proud of our efforts over time and in particular what weve accomplished this year which jerry salinas has been reporting on as we move through next year will be no different and were committed to improving our operating efficiency further in that regard ill note that our executive team is committed to reduce our own salaries by effective january as well as reducing my teams bonus targets by and mine by for the coming year were taking these actions despite the recognized success frost has had managing through the pandemic and supporting our customers and communities they represent managements desire to contribute to the current and future long term wellbeing of the company and reflect our commitment to our unique culture all of us at frost and all our lines of business will face these challenges together and our company as always will emerge stronger than ever now ill turn the call over to our chief financial officer jerry salinas for some additional comments cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 jerry salinas group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you phil looking first at our net interest margin our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter with down basis points from the reported last quarter the decrease primarily resulted from lower yields on loans which had a negative impact of approximately basis points on the net interest margin and a lower yield on securities which had a basis point negative impact combined with an increase in the proportion of balances of the fed as a percentage of earning assets which had about a basis point negative impact on the nim compared to the previous quarter lower interest costs in the quarter reduced these negatives by about basis points the taxable equivalent loan yield for the third quarter was down basis points from the previous quarter the decrease in yield was impacted by decreases in libor during the quarter as about two thirds of our loan portfolio excluding ppp is made up of floating rate loans and about of our floating rate loans are tied to libor the ppp loan portfolio also had a negative effect on our loan yield as compared to the second quarter during the third quarter we extended the expected term of the ppp portfolio somewhat which results in a yield on the ppp portfolio of during the third quarter as compared to in the second quarter this had a basis point negative impact on the comparison between the second and third quarter reported total loan yields looking at our investment portfolio the total investment portfolio averaged billion during the third quarter up about million from the second quarter average of billion the taxable equivalent yield on the investment portfolio was in the third quarter down basis points from the second quarter the decrease in the portfolio yield was driven by a decrease in the yield on our taxable portfolio the yield on that portfolio which averaged billion during the quarter was down basis points from the second quarter to as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency mbs securities given faster prepayment speeds and lower yields associated with recent purchases our municipal portfolio averaged about billion during the third quarter flat with the second quarter with the taxable equivalent yield of up basis point from the prior quarter at the end of the third quarter of the municipal portfolio was prerefunded or psf insured the duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was years up slightly from years last quarter regarding noninterest expense for the third quarter ill point out that the salaries line item includes about million in reductions in salary expense associated with truing up our incentive plans based on current expectations of projected payouts for the year as phil mentioned in this environment we continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending and looking for ways to operate more efficiently looking at the full year our previous guidance on expenses was at adding back to deferred expenses related to ppp loans we expected an annual expense growth of something around our current expectations would reduce that to something around the range with that ill now turn the call back over to phil for questions phillip d green chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you jerry okay well now open it up for questions cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of brady gailey your line is now open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its brady good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i wanted to start with the dynamics of the ppp loans i know last quarter i believe i remember you recognized about of those ppp fees it sounds like if youve extended the assumed duration of that portfolio maybe it was less than that in the third quarter but how much was realized in the third quarter of the ppp loans jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think the number was pretty comparable we did put some additional loans on during the third quarter and we did extend the expected life there just a little bit more than we expected originally but i think that the amount that weve recognized in the second quarter associated with that fee was in the million range so really pretty comparable with the second quarter brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i know you guys have been talking about the full year nim exppp coming in a little above youre three quarters of the way through so were getting close is that still the right way to think about the full year nim for you guys jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think at this point thats kind of what were at based on what were seeing so far i think that third quarter probably gives you a pretty good feel its kind of the projection for the rest of the year given just that weve got one quarter left and thatll get us i think thats kind of the range that we guidance that weve given for this for the quarter excuse me for the year cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then finally for me we have seen some companies especially some smaller banks there in texas re engage in the buyback was that as deferrals come down and maybe you guys feel a little more comfortable is that something that youre thinking about doing reengaging in the share repurchase plan phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady right now its not something thats on our radar screen immediately as you know it has been over time and i suspect at some point it will we will reengage but right now in the environment were focused on dividend protecting that providing capital for the growth that were seeing so but at some point yeah it will come back brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dave rochester your line is now open david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey good afternoon guys phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc how you doing jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good good on the expense guide that the growth thats from the million reported in is that right less the roughly in deferred expenses you mentioned jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah its from the reported number right and so were adding back the million in deferrals that we talked about in the second quarter cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc to our number so yeah i think youre thinking about it right dave david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got you okay i just want to make sure there and then on nim is the thinking that effectively the nim will probably continue to distrust lower from here ex the ppp fee amortization assuming the curve persists maybe even through next year as loans and securities continue to reprice and then what does that ultimately mean for the nii trend over time do you guys think that you can grow nii with that kind of a nim headwind jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think as far as you know your view of the nim i mean thats really kind of where were at right now obviously theres not a lot of opportunities to invest weve got i think between billion and billion at the fed on any given day and earning basis points and theres just not a lot of opportunities out on the yield curve right now we continue to say were going to be opportunistic and we pay attention but weve got quite a bit of liquidity and thats probably true for a lot of our competitors but just not ready to stick our toes in the water as of yet so there would be some potential there phil mentioned that loan pricing is still obviously competitive as a structure so i think your view that its going to be a tough road especially in given this sort of a rate environment i think that i have to agree with you that there is some potential to grow the net interest income like we said to the extent that we decided to invest some of that liquidity david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah where are you seeing reinvestment rates today i know you mentioned they were lower and that makes perfect sense just curious where they are right now jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc oh man im almost embarrassed to grab my files to be quite honest with you yeah i think the mortgage back ill go to the mbss that we purchased during the quarter just to give you a range there bear with me a second here so i think we were buying a mortgage backed or see here the agencies that we bought were at and i dont think we could get that today to be quite honest with you and as you heard me say theyre prepaying pretty quickly i think on the muni side we were looking at some 10year stuff thats probably in the pe sort of range so thats not too good david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 yeah no i hear you i mean is there a thought to just keep the securities book stable from here or maybe grow it a little bit over time just to support nii a little bit to the extent that maybe loan growth doesnt come roaring back jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i think thats kind of the view that were taking again we keep saying that were going to be opportunistic we wish that we had other opportunities but youre right i mean we will do something well kind of hold our nose if you will and decide to spend some of it but we really dont feel like its a place we want to be in right now to be quite honest with you david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah and maybe just switching to the one pipeline that was positive to hear that was up since last quarter where are you guys seeing the increase in activity there and then youve again mentioned the pickup in competition was just wondering which areas youre seeing competitive pressures the most and if youre actually seeing spreads compressing phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah well if you look at the that on a linked quarter basis not annualize its spread pretty evenly commercial real estate activity is up in terms of pipeline and commercial ci is up by the dollar amount of both of those is pretty comparable and so thats really where were seeing on it in terms of competition you are seeing pricing pressure return were not losing a lot of pricing because once we get to a customer that we think meets all our criteria that we want to have a long term relationship we dont want to lose it for a few basis points i think its one real interesting area to me that weve seen is the increase in deals that weve lost to structure if you look at ill give you two numbers one is if you look at large ci loans which we define large as over million of the deals weve lost have been to structure and if you look at commercial real estate deals to prospects we are losing the deals were losing were losing interestingly the same number to structure there as well so no i think its been a bit of a turnaround quarter for us from the second quarter obviously that was a really tough quarter but to see the growth in pipeline was good also another thing we look at is what we call our loan to book and our ratio there if you look yeartodate compared to last year weve looked at about more deals that is we had opportunities to look at a loan request and actual request and were up in terms of booking by so were doing a pretty good job of booking the deals that were seeing so its a tough market any time you see that much loss to structure mix you worry a little bit its mainly guarantees its advance rates its amortization periods all those kinds of things but even with all that im pretty happy with our success rate that were having david rochester q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great all right thanks for all the details guys appreciate it cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc absolutely thank you jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc thank you operator and our next question from the line of ebrahim poonawala your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to follow up one on just expenses and investments so jerry i think your guidance implies expenses go back around million plus or minus in the fourth quarter just talk to us in terms of when we look at the investments that you have ongoing in terms of the financial centers obviously the tightening on the comp side how should we think about expenses going into next year where youre going to continue to have the margin pressure just whats the best way to think about it internally how is management thinking about that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure i think that phil gave you a little bit of a view of how management is looking at it and ill defer to him a little bit let him talk and ill follow up after his conversation phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i mean i gave the example where our management teams decided to cut our salaries back and the bonuses target levels what i mentioned no we did that as because weve recognized that we need to be take a leadership position with regard to efficiencies theres work really the industry needs to do we certainly need to do on top of what weve done already and thats just the beginning of the process were beginning our planning for next year for the budget and this is one of the early decisions that were making i think it was really interesting and i was really proud by the way i should mention this of yesterday in our board meeting when i mentioned that to the board that that was our decision and their time when they have at the end of every meeting where they have their private session they decided unilaterally to decrease their cash compensation by to which i thought was a really frost thing to do so i think youre seeing leadership at the top including our board and our commitment to see increased efficiencies cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no thats commendable i guess maybe ask differently do you think you mentioned focus on positive operating leverage do you think the efficiency ratio can actually improve in this backdrop or do you think thats going to be challenging jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i missed the part where you said you at the very end to your question you said it did i think ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah do you think the efficiency ratio can improve from your in the current backdrop jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i mean i think as phil mentioned we are starting our process and obviously weve had a lot of conversations and so we know what weve committed to the board and so weve got a lot of work to do there we dont have all the plans in place so id feel a little uncomfortable giving too much guidance well give more color obviously in january what we want all of you to know is were taking it all very seriously and we understand the revenue pressure that were under and were looking for all the efficiencies that we can and some tough decisions will be made and well have to make them and well just continue to move forward there as far as what were doing in houston weve committed to doing that phil has said that all along and were making significant progress there theyre performing better than expected so well continue to move there were not going to slow that down at all we may open a couple of locations here and there but were obviously going to be very very prudent in what we do from that standpoint theres going to be cost so we have to spend whether thats from a technology standpoint whether its infrastructure whether its security related to technology so we know we have some costs to spend there but we also understand that in order to do that weve got to do things more efficiently and thats the sort of conversations that the executive team is in the middle of right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just shifting to phil give us a sense of so you talked about like loan pipeline there are some signs things look encouraging just give us a sense of whats the ground reality in terms of the economic outlook once we get to the elections next week as you think about next year are you more optimistic today in terms of what growth could look like relative to the headlines that we see or are you more cautious phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc id respond two ways with two items to that question one is i think that the election getting it behind everyone is going to be a real positive whichever way it goes its just going to add more clarity in the calls weve done with customers theres been more uncertainty around that than anything else and so i think once we can get past that i think attitudes will steal themselves and well move forward i think the thing that makes me most optimistic cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 going for cullen is that i dont want to blow past that number too fast and weve seen new relationships up by almost compared to where it was last year i mean we go along at about im going to guess something like a quarter in the commercial side for the last two quarters theyve been in the high and well all those not all those relationships by far are borrowing money because theres lots of uncertainty today whether its from politics whether its from elections whether its from covid for sure and the health situation i mean those relationships are what generate growth for us going forward and so thats the thing that makes me most positive another thing im positive about is just when you look at houston again weve been spending money and our shareholders have been patient and its a longterm strategy and all but when i look at our loan pipeline our active pipeline the houston market is higher and their loan pipeline than any of our other markets and the other markets arent doing bad so were just seeing payoff for that investment in that market and im encouraged about that as well well finish up that plan for that first we had hoped to be through by the end of this year i mean whats a two or three are going to bleed over into the early next year but its understandable given that covid environment everything else so well be through that weve hired some great people and im just really excited about whats going on there so i am optimistic about our prospects going forward i mean look rates are terrible and were big weve got a big investment portfolio lots of liquidity cant do anything about that but as far as the part we can do something about i am optimistic on how things are going right now now that said the virus has got to weve got to win on the virus right and as a nation as world we got to win on it and if it gets worse or they shut things down things will get worse hopefully we wont see that and well be able to move past that next year if we can do that then i am optimistic for the coming year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and im sorry if i missed it so did you mention who you are losing these loans to on structure are these other banks or are these nonbank financiers who are stepping in phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc ebrahim i havent heard that its nonbanks i mean there are some of those out there usually when ive heard reports on this its everywhere right it could be small banks large banks banks our size it could be private equity i havent heard anything different so i think its pretty broadly based people are starving for yield and it doesnt surprise me that its getting more competitive ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking all my questions phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc youre welcome operator your next questions come from the line of jennifer demba your line is now open cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc hi your fee income was indiscernible from the second quarter do you think these indiscernible have a good run rate going forward and could you expect pretty healthy growth again in the fourth quarter or do you think that that incremental improvement is kind of slowing down jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that yeah we were glad and i think in the second quarter call we said that we were starting to see in july that some of those accounts especially as it related to service charges on deposits were a big component of that is od nsf and then the interchange fees and debit card fees there was trending up and we did continue to see improvement there in the third quarter a lot of it as phil mentioned really is going to depend on what happens from an economic standpoint with the pandemic i think the numbers that were seeing in october are a little bit softer than the growth that weve been seeing in the third quarter so itll be interesting to see how it plays out but numbers are better but again were not seeing that same sort of accelerated rate that we saw during the second quarter jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc right thanks so much phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc sure operator your next questions come from the line of peter winter your line is now open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks good afternoon phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 indiscernible peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you guys had a just a small addition to reserves i was just wondering if you could talk about what drove the increase to reserves and do you think at this point youre done at least on building reserves jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that really the increase in reserves a big portion of it i think was related to the energy book the models indicated that we needed some additional dollars there and then also some of the work we did in management overlays in the oilfield services side of the book showed some increases there so i think our specific reserves in energy for example were like million in the second quarter up to million so i think thats where we saw the bulk of the increase and it was really related like i said to specific work associated i think with primarily with the oilfield services phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc right peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and would you say youre done you think at this point building reserves jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc i think that obviously that really has a lot to do with kind of what happens but i will say that obviously we feel very comfortable with where were at today we when you looked at our provisions you can see that were down from the second quarter you saw the chargeoffs were down to million thats basis points on average loans thats much closer to our normalized levels that we typically like to run so i think were certainly feeling positive about it but still cautious to be honest i think anybody that didnt say theyre cautious in this environment would be somewhat misleading so we feel good obviously of where we are but continue to be cautiously optimistic going forward phil any other color you want to add phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc no i would agree with jerry the weakness i think were seeing in the energy sector is around service because its theres not a lot of activity there the weakness is the rate that rate of that weakness has slowed the equipment utilization number is down but its not down by near as much as what it was before but still you got to service people that are under pressure weve by and large and historically performed pretty well in service and really its not that big a part of our portfolio its under million again probably under million but its something that were watching i think the bottom line is kind of what weve been saying and what jerry said earlier its whats going to whats demand going to do and whats covid going to do to demand if we end up locking the place down again youre going to see demand numbers go down and youll see price prices reduce and you could see problems increase but we weve been able to manage fair amount of stability recently and were and i feel good about the people that weve banked and our structures and the work that our people are cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 doing working with our customers so indiscernible just have to see how it goes from now unfortunately like everything else i think at some level it all still revolves around the virus and how we do there peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thats fair enough and then if i can just follow up on expenses you guys have come in better on expenses now two quarters in a row and then the guidance that you gave implies that there is going be a big jump in the fourth quarter can you talk about whats driving the increase i know you mentioned the million on the incentive accruals but whats driving that jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc right yeah so there are certain things that happen in the fourth quarter for some stock compensation awards that occur in october that vest immediately and so we deal with those expenses in the fourth quarter so were dealing with that weve also got some decisions that need to be made as it relates to marketing expenses for example related to advertising and how much do we want to do and we want to be sensitive to that even while managing expenses obviously we think that we want to be dutiful and diligent in how we spend those dollars weve had a lot of success in houston so we want to make sure that we do what we need to do so some of those decisions are still being made as we talked about the executive team is looking a lot at open positions that would be filled in the fourth quarter and whether those need to be filled in so those project that projection is really based on our best information but we continue to spend time not only on looking at how we can be more efficient in the some of that will go in to the fourth quarter of this year also but right now the guidance weve given is based on the best information we have peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc were going to do things that we need to do obviously weve talked about as many others have about branch locations do we need to make decisions about closing branches that may be not as profitable or necessary were building new branches obviously in houston and have others in the plan and so we just want to make sure that things that we do make sense to us organizationally so well do what we need to do and some of the work that were doing will affect the fourth quarter but at this point we dont have those commitments tied up peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thats really helpful thanks operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc audio gap cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so first i had a big picture question so when i think about cullenfrost ive always thought about you guys as a company that plays a long game right you invest in the franchise take great care of your employees your customers et cetera im somewhat surprised by the expense initiative can you talk about what prompted that phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc which initiative are you talking about steve are you talking just generally are you talking about something specific i just want to make im answering your direct question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc no i mean well you talked about reducing your own salaries right improving efficiency phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc for next year i mean weve been through periods before where youve had revenue pressure and i dont recall a message like this before it seems somewhat new and im curious what prompted indiscernible yourself from the board like what prompted this it seems to be a bit of a shift strategically phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc yeah i wouldnt i dont think of it that way first of all it didnt come from the board this is coming from our management team like i said i had i talked to the board about it yesterday i convinced them this is the right thing to do and they came back and reduced their own so were all of one mind on this i think one of the things thats different about lets take all right we had the financial crisis we were not in mortgage we had the opportunity because we had liquidity we had earnings we had taxable income we had the ability to go into the municipal market which was not a part of qe at that time and get some incredible yields in investments during that period of time and really through the 8plus years after that years or so after that those kind of opportunities are not available we see this as a longer period of time for the banking industry where youve got not just low shortterm rates which has happened in the past but youve got low longterm rates and youve got the covid environment and the uncertainty around all that and we just were just doing our job we are protecting our earnings stream we are doing what were asking our customers to do which is make sure that your business is running efficiently and youre able to take care of your obligations so its just part of our culture its a part of integrity caring and excellence cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 we do what is necessary to play the long game and believe me this is a long game its so long that i remember back to the so when you go back there you look at some of the things that we had to do this is nothing compared to that i was essentially cfo during that period of time and my job was to sell everything indiscernible down that could generate any capital because there was a big red line drawn around texas and there was no capital for nobody in this state and dick evans and the lending guys his job was to work out loans over time so as i recall i think i got one raise in six years back during that period of time so its you go back to the great depression or the money panic of the early you name it this organization has responded and done what we need to do so our view on this is its consistent with what weve done over the longterm and its also consistent with the longterm view of the company because we need to show we need as an industry to continue to be more efficient to apply the lessons that weve learned and the things that we have been able to do some of them on the fly that have made us very efficient we need to make sure that were applying those lessons going forward and look its part of our culture to do the right thing to not just say what to do but indiscernible and if youre not able to show with your actions what you mean then its really just empty words so thats what this is about steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and when you think about next year whats the right measure that youre after is it to actually improve the efficiency ratio yearoveryear is it to show ph pre pre growth like how are you going to measure how much needs to get done phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc its directional and what were seeing as jerry has talked about is were seeing pressure on revenues and so if your revenues are under pressure and if the feds telling you that they could be for some time then what you need to do is you need to make sure that you rationalize your expenses around those revenues and thats what were doing and its a directional process and its beginning and its something that were always careful on on expenses as weve talked about we are culturally careful on that weve got a conservative corporate culture but we just were in a situation where revenues we think will be under pressure for the industry for a possibly a couple years and we indiscernible strategy steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats very helpful and just finally and weve seen other banks undertake efficiency initiatives quite a few of them have done it with the help of outside consultants are you bringing somebody in from the outside to help out with this phillip d green a chairman chief executive officer cullenfrost bankers inc oh heck no weve in my years here that weve done that before my experience with those has been theyre very shortterm in nature they are theyre expensive to shareholders and they end up telling you taking your watch and telling you what time it is what were talking about doing is really doing deep dive thinking we call it we want to be smart about our business we want to do the right thing do things that are lasting longterm and with the view in all this to make to keep and improve the customer experience thats were not cullenfrost bankers inc cfr corrected transcript q3 earnings call 29oct2020 interested in doing anything that devalues our value proposition and our customer experience because thats really what is so key to our growth and success so and my experience with consultancies around expenses dont have that same view steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah ive had the same experience

about increasing the corporate tax rate from to if that pans out do you have any idea what the impact would be to cullen cullenfrost tax rate at a corporate tax rate jerry salinas a group executive vice president chief financial officer cullenfrost bankers inc brady of course all thats going to be dependent on what taxable income is right the simple way to do it if youre modeling it for us its really pretty simple its just a third increase if you think its going to be youd raise it by a third to its really almost as simple as that but obviously its going to be dependent on what the forecast
