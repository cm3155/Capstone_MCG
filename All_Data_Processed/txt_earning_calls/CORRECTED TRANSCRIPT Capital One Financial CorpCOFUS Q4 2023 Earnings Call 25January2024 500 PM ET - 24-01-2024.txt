presentation in the fourth quarter capital one earned million or per diluted common share for the full year capital one earned billion or per share included in the results for the fourth quarter was a million accrual for our current estimate of the fdic special assessment net of this adjusting item fourth quarter earnings per share were and full year earnings per share were on a linkedquarter basis growth in our domestic card business drove periodend loans up and average loans up periodend deposits increased in the quarter and average deposits were flat our percentage of fdic insured deposits grew to of total deposits in the fourth quarter revenue in the linked quarter increased driven by both higher net interest and noninterest income non interest expense was up in the quarter operating expense increased with roughly half of that increase driven by the fdic special assessment the full year operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments improved basis points to provision expense was billion comprised of billion of net chargeoffs and an allowance build of million turning to slide i will cover the allowance balance in greater detail the million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to approximately billion as of december the total company coverage ratio is now up two basis points from the prior quarter largely driven by a higher mix of card assets ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide outside of interest rates most of our economic assumptions are largely unchanged from the third quarter and we continue to assume several key economic variables modestly worsened from todays levels in our domestic card business the coverage ratio decreased by basis points to the allowance balance increased by million the predominant driver of the increased allowance was low loan growth in the quarter in our consumer banking segment the allowance was essentially flat at roughly billion coverage increased by four basis points to driven by a decline in auto loans in the quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 and finally in our commercial banking business the coverage ratio declined by three basis points to the allowance decreased by million primarily driven by the chargeoff of office real estate loans in the quarter we have included additional details on the office portfolio on slide of tonights presentation turning to page ill now discuss liquidity total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased by billion to about billion the increase was driven by a higher market value of our investment securities portfolio partially offset by modestly lower cash balances our cash position ended the quarter at approximately billion down billion from the prior quarter you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the fourth quarter was up from in the third quarter the increase in the lcr was driven by holding more of our cash balances at the parent company versus our banking subsidiary turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our fourth quarter net interest margin was four basis points higher than last quarter and basis points lower than the year ago quarter the quarteroverquarter increase in nim was largely driven by a continued mix shift towards card loans and higher asset yields partially offset by higher rate paid on deposits turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at approximately basis points lower than the prior quarter asset growth common and preferred dividends and the share repurchases more than offset net income in the quarter and with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew good evening everyone slide shows fourth quarter results in our credit card business credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide top line growth trends in the domestic card business remained strong even with growth moderating somewhat in the fourth quarter purchase volume for the fourth quarter was up from the fourth quarter of last year ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear average loans increased and fourth quarter revenue was also up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans the chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear to the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased basis points from the prior year to on a sequential quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points for the month of december the chargeoff rate was including a onetime impact of basis points described in a footnote in the monthly credit 8k adjusted for this impact the monthly chargeoff rate for december would have been pulling up on domestic card credit we believe that normalization has run its course and credit results have stabilized the 30plus delinquency rate has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 since august our monthly delinquency rate has been moving in line with normal seasonality and at stable ratios relative to the same month in and and at this point we have a pretty good window into january as delinquency entries in december indicate continuing delinquency rate stability in january weve always said that delinquencies are the leading indicator of where chargeoffs are going chargeoff rate tends to follow delinquency rate by about to months based on the stability weve seen in our delinquencies since august and extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and flow rates we believe the chargeoff rate is stabilizing now and settling out to about above levels i give this window because investors have been asking for quite some time when will chargeoffs level off so this is the point where we see that happening meaning chargeoffs should move more or less with seasonality in the coming months this window comes from modeling the flows in our delinquency buckets which have stabilized and our recoveries which have also stabilized and started to rebuild this isnt designed to be longerrun guidance but rather to indicate that chargeoffs are finally moving more or less with seasonality over the near term in the longer run there could be additional forces such as potential pressure from economic worsening and potential benefits from the depletion of deferred chargeoffs from the pandemic and recoveries picking up over time from increased inventories noninterest expense was up compared to the fourth quarter of with increases in both operating expense and marketing expense total company marketing expense of about billion for the quarter was up yearoveryear our choices in our card business are the biggest driver of total company marketing we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business and in the fourth quarter marketing also included higher media spend and increased marketing for franchise enhancements like our travel portal airport lounges and capital one shopping we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise as always were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks slide shows fourth quarter results for our consumer banking business in the fourth quarter auto originations declined yearoveryear driven by the decline in auto originations consumer banking ending loans decreased about billion or yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis ending loans were down we posted another strong quarter of yearoveryear growth in federally insured consumer deposits fourth quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about billion or yearoveryear compared to the sequential quarter ending deposits were up about average deposits were up yearoveryear and up from the sequential quarter powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digitalfirst national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong consumer deposit growth and gradually increase the percentage of total company deposits that are fdic insured consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about yearoveryear largely driven by lower auto loan balances and higher deposit costs noninterest expense was down about compared to the fourth quarter of lower operating expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing to support our national digital bank capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear compared to the linked quarter the chargeoff rate was up basis points while the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points both of these linked quarter increases were in line with typical seasonal expectations monthly auto credit began to stabilize even earlier than domestic card credit results on a monthly basis auto delinquency rate and chargeoff rate have been tracking normal seasonal patterns since the first half of and continued to do so through december slide shows fourth quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about average loans were also down about the modest declines are largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit ending deposits were down about from the linked quarter average deposits were down about the declines are largely driven by our continuing choices to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances reducing these less attractive deposits also drove the 14basispoint linked quarter improvement in our average rate paid on commercial deposits fourth quarter revenue was down from the linked quarter noninterest expense was also down about the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate for the fourth quarter increased basis points from the third quarter to the commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was up basis points compared to the linked quarter the criticized nonperforming loan rate was down basis points to commercial banking credit trends were largely driven by continuing pressure in our commercial office portfolio slide of the fourth quarter results presentation shows additional information about the remaining commercial office portfolio which is less than of our total loans in closing we continued to deliver solid results in the fourth quarter we posted another strong quarter of top line growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loans domestic card and auto delinquency trends were in line with normal seasonal patterns a continuing indicator of stabilizing consumer credit results we grew consumer deposits and total deposits and we added liquidity and maintained capital to further strengthen our already strong and resilient balance sheet our annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments for the full year was in we saw incremental opportunities and made choices to grow revenue and tightly manage costs to achieve a 99basispoint improvement in our annual operating efficiency ratio the actual improvement was better than the modest improvement we had been expecting over the last decade weve driven significant operating efficiency improvement even as weve invested to transform our technology and we continue to drive for efficiency improvement over time for the full year we expect annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be flat to modestly down compared to capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 our expectation includes the partial year impact of the proposed cfpb late fee rule assuming that rule takes effect in october pulling way up our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our businesses we continue to drive improvements in underwriting modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term we remain wellpositioned to deliver compelling longterm shareholder value and to thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice president finance capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have any questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call amy please start the qa question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you and rich thank you for the color on the chargeoffs i know you cited the pluses and minuses from here from stabilizing chargeoffs but im curious if you feel like the consumer positioning leans towards improvement here as inflation declines real income growth has resumed and should interest rates come down this coupled with the recoveries could benefit the chargeoff rate correct and im just thinking sort of how to think about the reserve rate going forward richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so sanjay yeah so first of all my comments i just i wanted with my credit comments and my sort of extrapolated look at our delinquency buckets i really wanted to share where our chargeoffs are settling out which is about above levels and we should also note by the way that in any year first half losses are seasonally higher than second half losses so within any normal year the first half is the peak now as i said were not really giving longer run guidance but lets think about the dynamics about how things could go from here from an economy point of view were certainly in a strong economy unemployment at a pretty remarkable place so i think if anything unemployment could have more downside than it has upside perhaps inflation has more upside than it does downside but i dont have any more insight to those than anybody else does i think i also would want to reinforce your point there are two good guys that should play out over time and weve been talking for a long time about the delayed chargeoff effect from the pandemic and when you think about that the pandemic had such a just absolutely unusual experience for consumers with all of the stimulus and capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 the forbearance and so on that we certainly have believed that chargeoffs that were otherwise going to happen at that time some got averted permanently but i think some got delayed and so this phenomenon that we call delayed chargeoffs i think its not a really quantifiable effect but i think its very much been a part of whats happening with in the normalization and something that intuitively will run its course and the other thing is recoveries so recoveries our recoveries while the rate per chargeoff dollar remains strong the number of chargeoff dollars in inventory thanks to the pandemic were at a really depressed level and so we have bottomed out there and theyre starting to now inventories are starting to increase of course as credit has normalized and that should also gradually be a good guy also when i look at our origination strategy and the underwriting choices we make these are consistent with longer term losses that are lower than where we are now so we consciously focused our credit commentary to really focus on where things settle out and then theres a list of forces that could work in either direction but i think you certainly point out some of the good guys sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay just a followup maybe andrew could you just talk about the reserve rate on a goforward basis and how we should think about it should it stabilize can it come down and maybe just also on the nim with rates coming down how we should think about the movement over the course of the year thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure sanjay let me compartmentalize those two things the nim will be a whole separate answer but with respect to allowance well let me first start with just a tactical housekeeping item which is a reminder that in q4 we have some seasonal balances that quickly pay off in the first quarter and therefore have negligible coverage so the coverage ratio in q4 is modestly lower as a result of that dynamic and it reverses itself in q1 but again a real modest effect there longer term though projected losses are really going to be the biggest driver of coverage and as weve said before delinquencies are the best leading indicator of that and rich just provided a fulsome description of all of the forces at play there so from a reserve perspective every quarter were just going to be looking at the next months of projected losses with the first six more consequential in the calculation but also far more predictable given the visibility that we have through delinquencies and then the remainder of that window really informed by economic assumptions and then the reversion to the longterm average and so over the last few quarters things have played out consistent with or slightly better than what weve expected and youve seen the coverage ratio in card roughly stay flat so i think its important to note that even in a period where projected losses in future quarters are lower than today and might otherwise indicate a release we could very well see a coverage ratio that remains flat or only modestly declined as we incorporate some of that uncertainty into the allowance but eventually in a scenario like that after a period of coverage stability like weve seen you would see coverage coming down in the release of nongrowth related reserves richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp nim capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp nim sure theres a lot of factors at play with nim and maybe ill do the same housekeeping with nim just to remind everyone that in the first quarter with one fewer day were going to see roughly a 7basispoint headwind there but let me then also enumerate here the puts and takes to nim on the tailwind side growth in card balances as a percentage of the balance sheet and even within those balances possibly higher revolve rate certainly a tailwind and thats something weve seen over the last couple of quarters and then also a lower cash balance weve talked about this before but cash balances today in total of billion i think the number is with about billion at the fed is quite a bit higher than prepandemic i dont think well get back to where we were prepandemic but i would expect over time that will come down from todays level so that would also be a tailwind to nim on the headwind side even though the fed has stopped moving up in july we continue to see some deposit product rotation and it creates a bit of upward pressure to the deposit betas and then even if the fed starts decreasing rates were going to see the assets reprice more quickly than the deposits and the competitive environment and the backdrop of qt will potentially have an impact on betas on a downward cycle so that would create a bit of margin pressure and then a couple of other things that i would just highlight as potential headwinds the uncertainty around potential regulatory changes that could impact interest income as well as just the path of credit youve seen suppression go up over the last few quarters as losses go up so that also creates some pressure to nim so i know that that was a list of puts and takes but i partially go into that level of detail to say its kind of hard to say where nim is going to go in the near term especially because the path of interest rates remains fairly wide at this point but kind of gives you a sense of all of the forces at play but over the much longer term i would say theres nothing really structurally different about our balance sheet from where it was prepandemic that leads me to believe that nim will be materially different than where it was based on at least what we know today jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp hey ryan andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey ryan capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc rich when i look you put about billion of marketing expense for the second straight year and youre continuing to drive strong growth were hearing about some others with a little bit of a more cautious tone on growth so maybe just talk about are you leaning in and do you expect marketing to increase and really where are you seeing the best opportunities in the market and how are you thinking about growth looking ahead thanks and i have a followup richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thanks ryan we feel very good about the opportunities in the marketplace so we are leaning in were definitely leaning in the you can see obviously there was quite a lot of marketing in the fourth quarter but we continue to see opportunities across the board especially in the card business so just pulling up there are a few key factors driving our marketing that we want to continue to emphasize first of all were just really excited about the growth opportunities across our business we have over the last number of years made some what we call sort of adjustments around the edges and trimming around the edges lately theres really even not a lot of trimming around the edges were in a very stable place with respect to the business were going after the results were getting and the zeal that we have to capitalize on that and i think our technology transformation of course has really been beneficial but it allows us to leverage more data and more machine learning models to identify basically more attractive opportunities for investments and to create better and more customized solutions for customers along the way so just the overall opportunities continue to be very strong the second part of our marketing investment of course relates to our quest to win at the top of the market and weve been going after heavy spenders now for almost years and that needs sustained high levels of investment and you can see those out in the marketplace in flagship products in groundbreaking experiences like things like bestinclass digital customer experiences really highlevel elite customer servicing online travel portal and in the intersection of risk management and the quest to go to the top of the market the incredible importance of advanced fraud defense is to ensure that the card always works and increasingly were also just rolling out exclusive services and experiences that arent available in the general marketplace such as airport lounges and access to select properties so we continue to lean into growth here and obviously that quest towards the top of the market involves quite a bit of marketing investment and a lot of upfront investment for annuities that are just wonderful longlasting fabulous annuities and the third vector of real marketing investment is our continuing efforts to build our national bank and just as a reminder we have a smaller branch footprint and so we lean more heavily on our technology investments our digital experiences our cafe network and our brand and marketing investments to continue to organically build this national bank and we are really pleased with the traction there and its been a lot of years in the making but we are definitely leaning in there and love the results capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 so ryan those are the window into how were thinking about it and the compelling opportunities across the board that we see and we are continuing to capitalize on the opportunity as we see it ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and rich if you put late fees aside for the first part of my question you talked about stable to modest improvement which exlate fees would imply continued improvement on the operating efficiency do you think were back exlate fees on a sustained journey of improving efficiency like you were talking about before the pandemic and then second just how are you thinking about the timing of offsetting late fees thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah thank you so our story about efficiency i think has been a very consistent story for a bunch of years and its i think a lot of companies drive efficiency by just continuing to cut costs on their way to greatness and we certainly put a lot of energy into the cost side of our business but really its been about building a business model powered by technology and the customer experiences were building to drive revenue growth and efficiency and both at the same time and weve talked about how so much of this is powered by technology and we continue to see the benefits of that so we at the on the one hand keep leaning into technology and keep investing there and on the other hand see a growing opportunities to drive efficiency as a beneficiary of the technology investment so pulling way up while any particular year can be different from overall trends we continue to believe that an important part of the value proposition with investors and the benefit of the years of investment were making is to continue to drive greater operating efficiency so did you have a cfpb question yes so let me turn ryan to talk about that so the cfpbs late fee proposal as currently contemplated would reduce late fees by approximately while the cfpbs proposal has not been finalized we expect the cfpb to publish a proposal soon and once the cfpb publishes its final rule we expect there to be industry litigation that could delay or block the implementation of the rule this litigation will likely delay the implementation of the rule until at least the second half of this year and maybe longer you saw we talked about an estimate of october if the proposed rule is implemented there will be a significant impact to our pl in the near term relative to what our path would have been however we have a set of mitigating actions that were working through that we believe will gradually resolve this impact a couple of years after the rule goes into effect and these choices include changes to our policies our products and investment choices now some of these actions will take place before the rule change takes effect and a few are already underway many will come after the rule change takes effect jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from the line of arren cyganovich with citi your line is open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 thanks i was hoping youll talk a little bit about the auto business you continue to pull back a little bit from that side thinking about how youre feeling about potentially increasing some originations still a healthy amount of originations at billion this year but just wondering when you might make a pivot there richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks arren so weve been cautious in auto for a couple of years now we noted over this period of time a number of headwinds in the business so lets tally them up margin pressure from the interest rate cycle normalizing credit vehicle values normalizing from their alltime highs and affordability pressures stemming from the combined effects of elevated interest rate and still high car prices now as you know we dont work backwards from growth targets and we remain disciplined in our originations setting pricing and terms that were comfortable with and then take what the market gives us so back in we raised price tightened our credit box at the low end of the market and took other steps to manage the resilience of our lending as a result our run rate of originations has been lower than like two years ago but as a result of our actions weve been just very pleased with the performance of our auto originations the credit performance has been really striking which of course you can see so even as vehicle values continue to normalize risk on our most recent originations from remains below what we saw in our prepandemic originations probably is the result of our actions and vintage over vintage that risk remains stable the margins on new originations have improved as well particularly over the last couple of months as interest rates have come down from their recent peaks so we feel quite good about the performance of our auto originations so we continue to adjust our strategies where we see opportunities for growth or emerging risk but of course thats what we always do but when we think about some of the headwinds i think some of those headwinds are easing and the results that were seeing on our own book are really pretty striking and gratifying so that gives us a more bullish outlook still with a note of caution arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions this afternoon hey rich youve given some a framework for chargeoffs into one of the observations we would make is that delinquencies even through december on a yearoveryear basis due are trending are up on a yearoveryear basis even though that increase has slowed substantially capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 that suggests very consistent with your description that chargeoffs will continue to rise through the first half of the year what im curious about is given that delinquencies are still up basis points basis points yearoveryear in december when we look into the second half of the year i understand seasonally that they will be down but would you expect the chargeoffs in the second half of the year will still be up versus richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so i think the best way to think about this is to focus on the most stable benchmarks our focus here is about stability so were really looking at what are the most stable benchmarks that we can anchor to and that really leads us back to and so let me just sort of speak in that sort of doubleclick a little bit into my comments on that so our delinquencies are above prepandemic levels but theyve been tracking with normal seasonality for quite some time and now compared to since august were running around above the level for the same month of compared to since may were running at around above the level for the same month of and at this point we have a pretty good window into january of as well based on delinquency entries in december and that looks like its going to be another month of stability so we feel confident declaring that our delinquencies have stabilized and of course delinquencies are our best leading indicator of credit performance our chargeoffs have been catching up to the stabilizing trend in our delinquencies over the second half of but at this point what were declaring here is that our chargeoffs are leveling off as well now theres more monthtomonth volatility in chargeoffs than in delinquencies by quite a bit because every data point of delinquencies includes months of delinquency inventories and of course chargeoffs is looking at the relatively small number that falls off at the end of the last bucket and there was also some noise in the fourth quarter of that makes it less reliable as a chargeoff benchmark so we actually think is an even better benchmark for our chargeoffs for comparing our chargeoffs in this fourth quarter that just happened to a past stable year in the fourth quarter our net chargeoffs were about above levels and of course rolled into so thats an appropriate benchmark to look at as we head into and compare to now when we look ahead extrapolating from our current delinquency inventories and recent flow rates we conclude that our net chargeoffs are stabilizing at about above with of course some typical monthstomonths volatility and normal seasonality now of course the seeds of this stabilization have been planted for quite a long time now and partly driven by the choices that we made back in and coming out of the pandemic we were concerned about two trends fintechs were flooding the market especially the subprime market with credit offers creating the potential for credit worsening and adverse selection in our originations we also anticipated that pandemic era stimulus and forbearance would temporarily inflate consumer credit scores and that fees would revert over time so we tightened our underwriting in anticipation of these effects and we have continued to make adjustments at the margin since then and the result has been striking that with all the kind of changes the normalization all the noise over the last number of years that there has been strikingly stable performance on our origination vintages capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 basically in our postpandemic originations each quarterly vintage for a given segment has been more or less on top of each other and also relatively consistent with prepandemic vintages and over time this just created a lot of stability that increasingly moved into our portfolio and it contributed to the stabilization of our portfolio credit trends and as weve looked at this we said these are very good shoulders to stand on to have that much stabilization for so long we of course all still waited to see exactly the manifestations ultimately of the portfolio stabilizing another factor contributing to stabilization is our recovery rate and unusually low recoveries have been the largest driver of our overall chargeoff rate running above prepandemic levels and this is of course because of the very low level of chargeoffs over the past three years and therefore we had a low level of raw material for future recoveries and by the way just to capital one point here this is a larger effect for us than for most competitors because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries so they come in over time not all at once like in a debt sale and so weve recently observed that our recovery rate has stabilized and started to tick back up and now that our recoveries inventory has started to rebuild thats of course a good guy although its coming from a pretty low level and this also contributes to our confidence that our overall loss trends have stabilized so when you to your question where are you at compared to what we have really done is really anchor our benchmarking to the most stable years in recent experience and and since weve seen delinquencies and charge offs stabilize relative to like quarters in those benchmarks we felt the best language with which to describe where things are settling out is to do it as a multiple of those two generally stable years and so we are entering now with a real sense of stability and weve benchmarked where we are as a multiple of those two stable year benchmarks jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with td cowen your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks maybe rich just following up on that i think that a lot of the marketing dollars in the card space have been spent at the transactor business but given that stability that youre talking about and i assume the bulk of the dollars of loss delinquency and loss are coming from kind of the lower end of the card spectrum so does that mean that thats an area for expansion in like how should we think about that and i do have a followup richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp sorry moshe are you saying is the lower end an area for expansion moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 yes richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so we feel what we feel good about all of our segments across the credit spectrum in card and also the relative health of the consumer and youve known us for a long time moshe as long as we have for the decades weve been talking together you know that we have a long history of delivering sustained resilience and profitability at the lower end of the marketplace and we lets just reflect on this for a second if youre talking about subprime credit card this is a complex business that requires deep investment in informationbased underwriting and of course weve spent decades developing and testing tailored product structures and sort of honing the analytical and the operating and underwriting and marketing capabilities to attract and serve this franchise but also with the number one and two and three most important things to us has been resilience as we do this and whats really been pretty striking is how consistent our strategy has been over the years through the great recession and following that and if we and weve talked about how the lower end of the marketplace whether youre talking and by the way theres a whole when you talk about the lower end of the marketplace obviously we theres a whole part of the marketplace that capital one doesnt serve but in terms of the lower end of the marketplace that we serve if you look at either income or fico and look at the normalization thats going on weve seen very solid curing in that part of the market it in fact even started it cured a little bit earlier than some of the other parts of the market but the curing story the leveling off story were talking about today is absolutely across the board i do want to say though also moshe relative to your point youve had fintechs who we were very concerned about flooding that into the market some years ago they certainly have massively dialed back and i think that the continued when we see the success of our vintages the stabilization now the stabilization overall of capital ones whole portfolio and the dynamics in the marketplace i think that we like the opportunities we see there moshe and we will be leaning into that moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great and just as a followup i mean youve talked in the past about not just the financial impact of the late fee but also its deterrent impact so how do you think about that in terms of the resilience of that segment as we go forward post any changes to late fees and maybe just as a side point you did mention that you thought you could improve the efficiency ratio even with the late fee i mean that just seems like youd have to take a couple of hundred million dollars out of expenses to do that so if theres a way to talk about how that would happen and tack that on to the answer that would help too thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so moshe capital one has pursued a strategy for many years of trying to create and deliver to the marketplace strikingly simple products because from sort of a mission and strategy point of view we believe so much in this and we built a brand over having very simple products capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 and so things like for example on the banking side no minimum balance requirements no membership fees and even no overdraft fees so here we are a company that has really really reduced the fees but if we had one fee left i think the fee we would most hang on to is the late fee because to your point it plays a very important role in the deterrent value to a consumer and an analogy that we sometimes use is a speeding ticket i think that if a speeding ticket were lets say we had an speeding ticket im not sure that our highways would be quite as safe as they are now because if were really trying to deter behavior that we think is really consequential for people that really is the role of the fee weve been very active in giving alerts to all of our customers late payment due alerts with the goal of not trying to maximize late fees but actually trying to maximize the onpayment performance of our customers so moshe this is a question that weve been worried about your question about what could be the impact on credit performance of individuals and its something that were just going to have to if this cfpb rule goes into effect were all going to experience together this not controlled experiment but we certainly mark us down for having a concern about that but from a financial point of view obviously the late fees are an important thing on the pl and as ive talked about we have created a set of many actions across different types of things from policies products pricing structures investment choices to claw back the very significant economic impact some of those things are underway some of them just to mention it by the way by the time we get there when the rule is announced some of the offsets are going to by then be into the run rate of the company and a majority will still be waiting to happen with respect to the fourth quarter that ph is the big full year effect obviously something coming in late in the fourth something coming in in our estimate in the fourth quarter doesnt have as much impact on the annual efficiency ratio but it still does have an impact so essentially whats implied underneath it is quite a bit of progress on the efficiency ratio behind the flattomodestly down guidance that includes that fourth quarter effect jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi hi guys thanks for taking my call in the interest of time given its late in the call ill ask my twoparter all upfront here first on the marketing side i know you indicated you expect to continue to lean in on marketing this year what does that imply on how youre thinking about full year marketing expense i mean could that mean that youll see marketing come in above the billion level that you saw this year or could it be stable or a modest decline and then my second question is on the credit side on commercial real estate office cre i know you had some lumpy losses this quarter and some pressure still in criticized and nonaccruals if you could just give us a little bit more color there in terms of what you charged off and your outlook on that front thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 okay john thanks for your good questions here we dont typically give full year marketing guidance and the reason is because marketing depends of course a lot on the opportunities that we see when we get there so what i wanted to just share in response to ryan nashs question is a continuation in the positivity that we feel both about the realtime numbers were seeing of response and performance of our vintages and all of that and then also the sort of more structural investments that were making in the business particularly with respect to going after the heavy spenders so we dont have full year guidance but we certainly continue to like the opportunities that we see andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp and then john on the office side its virtually impossible to generalize office it is incredibly property specific weve talked in the past about us having a fair amount in gateway cities and having a mix of both a and b c properties but frankly the decomposition matters a whole lot less than the individual properties and so what we saw in the quarter was a little more than million of losses tied to office loans we continue to not originate there balances have come down to about billion i think down about million in the quarter its less than of our total loans but as we charged off in the quarter we had essentially reserved entirely for that amount and then we built back up a little bit for the remaining portfolio to maintain the coverage at around jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc rich youve made a lot of progress on heavy spenders as you look out where are we i guess on that expense cycle are we still looking at many years of acceleration or do you hit some type of level where theres some scale kicking in just trying to get a sense on where we are on that investment cycle richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well don its certainly i think the quest to the heavy spender to win in the heavy spender of the marketplace it will be a quest as far out as we can see in the same way it is for the players who the small number of players who are really going after that business the key part of it is were getting more and more scale along the way so youve seen over the years the growth in purchase volume what you dont see is the purchase volume growth rate by level of spender and any segmentation weve been looking at it monotonically the growth rates monotonically faster the more you go up towards the heavy spenders so its just indicating were getting a lot of traction there so i wouldnt want to say that that we just have to do a blitz and then were done with the investment the way that scale is achieved is by getting more and more customers in a business where all the players in the business even including the largest continue to invest in that business but were really pleased with the traction and thats why we continue to invest capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats all i had thanks jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich and andrew i appreciate all of the very clear commentary on what youre seeing in credit theres a view that if wed had a mild recession and experienced the purging of weaker credits that that would have provided a clear runway for growth coming out of that but instead the environment were in is arguably a little bit muddier and some would stay still late cycle could you speak to that dynamic rich and whether that weighs on how youre thinking about growth from here in any way and as a followup ill just ask it now for you andrew can you update us on how youre thinking about capital return from here andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure why dont i start bill look at this point there still remains a number of uncertainty around capital not the least of which is the endgame proposal were all aware theres been quite a bit of advocacy there and there remains a fair amount of uncertainty of where the rule will land including things like the impact of aoci and phasein and ops risk and other forces at play so were you know as much as we do and were waiting to see what the final rule holds there but in addition to that were coming up on ccar we dont yet have the scenarios for this year you look back at how impactful the scenario as well as the starting balance sheet is to those outcomes youve seen our scb fluctuate over the last four years from i think down to and now were sitting here at so waiting to get a little bit more clarity of what ccar will hold and then in addition we continue to see a range of outcomes in our own growth projections and finally ill just point to the economy theres the consensus view is growing of a soft landing but theres still quite a wide range of outcomes there and so given all of those factors weve chosen to operate for the last few quarters around we recognize that when we feel like were in an excess capital position that returning it is one way to create value and under the scb framework we have that flexibility to manage repurchases dynamically and well use that flexibility when we think its prudent to do so richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp bill a comment on our continuing to lean in given that some people might argue that the economic environment is late cycle so certainly a great question so there first of all the bottom line is we are continuing to lean in obviously we keep a wary eye out for things that could change but i sort of start with the health of the consumer capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 i think the us consumer remains a source of strength in the overall economy and the labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year really defying the expectations of many economists in the face of rising interest rates consumer debt servicing burdens remain relatively low by historical standards again despite rising interest rates home prices are back and doing a bit better and theyre generally near alltime highs in aggregate consumers across all income levels still have excess savings also from the pandemic although those numbers are declining inflation has moderated to the point that real wages are growing again after shrinking for almost two years student loan repayments now they resumed in october but theres the 12month onramp period and a new incomedriven repayment plan which will significantly reduce payments for lower income borrowers so on the whole id say consumers are in really quite good shape relative to most historical benchmarks then if we look inside our own portfolio we still see higher average payments compared to by segment by a really pretty sizable delta we and then we then look at the marketplace and youve seen in the auto business how at times we get alarmed by some of the practices or the pricing in the industry and we pull back in ways that we havent pulled back in the card business but i think we see a rational and stable competitive marketplace its very competitive but its rational and its stable and then most importantly the results themselves our vintages just continue to come in on top of prior vintages the trimming around the edges that weve done over the last few years have really i think allowed our results to have a stability to them that even has diverged from the sort of underlying not as good performance in the marketplace of things recently compared to the past but we have that real stability then we see the leveling off of our portfolio and really we talk about our chargeoffs leveling off at a level thats like above its interesting actually thats net chargeoffs but gross chargeoffs are leveling off very close to the gross chargeoff levels of and and actually the thing that creates the differential is the lower recoveries that weve had for as a in the wake of the inventory recoveries being so much lower inventory of chargeoff debt so pulling way up and seeing the traction in our business the success with our brand the things that for competitive reasons we dont share in the marketplace but the traction on the tech side in terms of enabling us to create better really unique customized customer experiences totally customized underwriting the reaching to marketing channels that we hadnt even tapped before all of this is putting us in a position to continue to pulling way up obviously in the credit business we always worry a lot but if i calibrate this relative to a lot of other times i feel really quite good about this and i actually said i felt a lot less good a couple of years ago because i felt that the pandemic well from a credit point of view who couldnt like those credit results i said it actually is so abnormally good the marketplace wont be able to help itself but create unusual practices unresilient underwriting et cetera so actually what weve had if i can borrow the softlanding term from the economy conversations is kind of a softlanding relative to the credit business and landing is really quite the right word relative to capital one which i think really as ive kind of declared today as sort of landed here and i know some competitors still havent fully landed but pulling way up on this i actually feel this is really quite a good time if i calibrate to all the times over the years in this exciting journey jeff norris a senior vice president finance capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2024 operator our final question comes from the line of dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is open dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thanks so much for all the color on the call today i actually have two questions rich what are you seeing do you think thats making the net chargeoffs stabilize above levels is there something in the consumer payment behavior thats changed is there something you think that shifted the consumer in general where the credit card industry may be seeing a higher through the cycle net chargeoff rate going forward or for capital one in particular and i just have a followup thanks so much richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so i actually believe that what were really seeing here is a credit situation thats very similar to prepandemic it is showing up right now and im going to speak through the capital one lens i think im not going to universalize for the industry but as i mentioned in the to the prior answer there that if you look at gross chargeoffs where theyre settling out for capital one now this is capital one that has done a lot of trimming around the edges over the last a fair amount of trimming around the edges i think we also did a very important choice that im not sure was universal it might have been an unusual choice but when we saw the incredibly strong credit performance of consumers much of it driven by stimulus and forbearance we sort of became alarmed about credit score grade inflation if you will and essentially intervened in our models to normalize so that we didnt get fooled by that but this is the end so as a result of that we have stabilized were probably one of the first players to stabilize and we stabilized at this moment at above say benchmark to levels already we said that that number from a gross chargeoff number is really very close to levels so the recoveries effect which is a temporary effect that our recoveries are so much lower because they just dont have as much inventory of chargeoffs to collect on thats a good guide that should help over time so i think also as we have talked about and weve talked about ever since the pandemic sort of we started coming out of the other side of the pandemic we said theres another effect lets call it the delayed chargeoff effect that if you think about all those chargeoffs that would have happened many of that would have happened in the pandemic but didnt some of them may have gotten a reprieve for the long run but a bunch of others we certainly have felt are going to charge off over time and that is a temporary effect that we think has been playing out over this normalization thing its not we have ways that we try to measure it but nobody can precisely measure this but this is also something that leads to an elevation of chargeoffs relative to probably whats an equilibrium so if i speak from capital ones point of view our guidance was to guide you to the leveling off because of the lower recoveries effect right now thats leveling off at a above the underlying credit dynamics seem very similar to me to what was there in the past i think there even as we keep a wary eye on the economy theres some just sort of actuarial good guys making their way through the business and all other things being equal that can help the credit metrics more and more show that they are strikingly similar to what was there before the pandemic so pulling way up i dont think and again ill speak i dont think things have shifted i think were seeing some trends playing out but for capital one were we feel great about where weve stabilized and we see really a good assessment of our future capital
