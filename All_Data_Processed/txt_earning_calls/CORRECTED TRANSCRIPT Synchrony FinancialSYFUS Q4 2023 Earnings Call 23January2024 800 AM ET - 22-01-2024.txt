ill turn the call over to brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 thanks brian and good morning everyone synchronys fourth quarter results demonstrated the power of our differentiated business and financial model performing as designed our diversified sales platform and spend categories enabled record purchase volume growth as our disciplined underwriting and credit management kept credit performance in line with our expectations our retail share arrangements ensured an alignment of economic interests between synchrony and our partners as credit normalized towards historical prepandemic levels and funding costs increased from higher benchmark rates our rsa payments were lower providing a partial buffer to the economic environment and enabling synchrony delivery of consistent attractive riskadjusted returns and our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to return capital to shareholders while investing in opportunities to achieve our longerterm strategic goals all while delivering for our customers and partners and their evolving needs today overall our prudent business management and differentiated financial model have positioned synchrony to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers partners and shareholders through an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop this past year and as we move forward in now lets turn to our fourth quarter results purchase volume increased versus last year and reflected the breadth and depth of our sales platforms and the compelling value our products offer combined with a resilient consumer in health wellness purchase volume increased reflecting broadbased growth in active accounts led by dental pet and cosmetic verticals digital purchase volume increased with growth in average active accounts and strong customer engagement diversified value purchase volume increased reflecting a higher in and outofpartner spend lifestyle purchase volume increased with stronger average transaction values in outdoor and luxury in our home auto purchase volume decreased as lower customer traffic fewer large ticket purchases and lower gas prices more than offset growth in home specialty auto network and commercial purchase volume across synchrony dual and cobranded cards grew and represented of total purchase volume for the quarter reflecting the broad utility and value that these products deliver for our customers as weve discussed in the past our outofpartner spend is split roughly evenly between discretionary and non discretionary categories and this trend held steady throughout the year in the fourth quarter we saw some shift in categories as consumers shifted from travel spend to clothing for instance and from gasoline and automobiles towards spend at grocery and discount stores but weve not seen any meaningful changes in the overall composition between discretionary and nondiscretionary spend the combination of broadbased purchase volume growth and approximately basis point decrease in payment rates drove ending loan receivables growth of our fourth quarter payment rate of still remains approximately basis points higher than our fiveyear prepandemic historical average net interest income increased to billion driven by growth in interest and fees the increase in interest and fees reflected the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates as well as a lower payment rate our net interest margin of declined basis points compared to the prior year the decrease largely reflected higher interestbearing liability costs which increased basis points to and reduced net interest margin by basis points synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 this impact was partially offset by basis points of growth in loan receivables yields which contributed basis points to net interest margin higher liquidity portfolio yield added basis points to net interest margin and our loan receivables growth improved the mix of interestearning assets contributing basis points to net interest margin rsas of million in the fourth quarter were of average loan receivables a reduction of million versus the prior year reflecting higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher net interest income provision for credit losses increased to billion reflecting higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve build which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables other expenses grew to billion the increase primarily reflected growthrelated items as we continue to see strong growth in volumes as well as a return of operational losses to prepandemic average levels as a percent of our purchase volume expenses in the quarter also included several notable items including million in employee costs related to a voluntary early retirement program million in real estaterelated restructuring charges as we continue to adjust our physical footprint in favor of a hybrid working environment million for the fdics special assessment million of preparatory expenses in anticipation of a potential late fee rule change and million of transactionrelated expenses related to the sale of pets best our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter improved by approximately basis points compared to last year to excluding the impact of the notable items in the quarter our efficiency ratio would have been approximately basis points lower in the fourth quarter all in synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of next ill cover our key credit trends on slide overall we see the consumer remaining resilient as they manage through inflation and higher interest rates the external deposit data we monitor also supports this view as it shows average savings account balances return closer to prepandemic levels during and remain relatively steady through the third and fourth quarters at yearend average industry savings balances remained approximately above levels from our disciplined through cycle underwriting and active credit management has positioned us well as we entered our delinquency ratios finished the year slightly above average levels from to prior to the pandemic at yearend our 30plus days delinquency rate was compared to in the prior year and basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of to our 90plus days delinquency rate was versus last year and basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of to and consistent with our expectations synchronys net chargeoffs reached in the fourth quarter compared to in the prior year and an average of in the fourth quarters of and we continue to monitor our portfolio and implement actions as necessary to proactively position our business for and beyond moving to reserves our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was down basis points from in the third quarter the reserve build of million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth turning to slide synchronys balance sheet continues to be a source of flexibility and strength our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with customers in the fourth quarter driving over billion of growth in total deposits in the quarter or compared to the prior year at quarterend deposits represented of our total funding while securitized debt comprised and unsecured funding total liquid assets and undrawn credit synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 facilities were billion up billion from last year and at quarterend represented of total assets up basis points from last year moving on to our capital ratios as a reminder we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies synchrony will continue to make its annual transitional adjustments to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately basis points each january until the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet additionally in the fourth quarter synchrony made a change to its balance sheet presentation of contractual amounts related to our retailer partner agreements at yearend assets of approximately million which were previously classified as intangible assets were reclassified to other assets and prior periods were reclassified to conform to this presentation this change in presentation had a corresponding impact to each of our regulatory capital metrics and resulted in an increase of approximately basis points to our capital ratios in both the current and prior years under the cecl transition rules and including this balance sheet change we ended the fourth quarter with a cet1 ratio of basis points lower than last years the tier capital ratio was compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year during the fourth quarter we returned million to shareholders consisting of million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends at the end of the quarter we had million remaining in our share repurchase authorization we remain wellpositioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan we will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow synchrony remains committed to our capital allocation framework which prioritize investment in organic growth and payment of our regular dividends followed by share repurchases and investments in inorganic growth opportunities where the rates of return meet or exceed that of our other potential uses of capital to that end as brian mentioned synchrony announced the acquisition of the ally lending pointofsale financing business which we view as a great opportunity to expand our leadership position in the home improvement and health wellness verticals while leveraging our industry expertise and scale to unlock still greater value weve agreed to purchase approximately billion of loan receivables at a discount upon closing the transaction and subject to completion of purchase accounting we expect our cet1 ratio to be reduced by approximately basis points inclusive of provision for credit losses of approximately million relating to initial reserve builds synchrony expects this acquisition to be accretive to full year earnings per share excluding the impact of initial reserve build for credit losses upon integration of our business conversion to our prism underwriting model and execution of our strategy we expect to achieve attractive internal rate of return with approximately 35year tangible book value earnback additionally the sale of our pets best business will result in approximately million gain net of tax in which will contribute to an approximately basis point increase to our cet1 ratio inclusive of the capital required we held on minority interest in iph excluding the gain on sale we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings were excited about the opportunities weve identified to continue to drive consistent growth and synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 appropriate riskadjusted returns and have established a long track record of execution across both strategic and financial objectives during we drove strong growth in purchase volume which combined with the payment rate moderation to deliver solid growth in loan receivables we were opportunistic in funding that growth and continue to expand our deposit franchise and in turn deliver attractive net interest income credit normalized in line with our expectations and our rsa functioned as designed and finally we fulfilled our commitment to deliver positive operating leverage turning to slide lets review our outlook for our baseline assumptions for this discussion include a stable macroeconomic environment full year gdp growth of approximately a yearend unemployment rate of and an ending fed funds rate of with cuts beginning in the second half of this outlook also assumes a closing of our pets best and ally lending transactions in the first quarter of and given the uncertainty of timing and implementation of a potential final rule regarding late fees weve not assumed any related impact to our financial outlook in the event that a final late fee rule is published we will provide an update with the associated impact to our financial guidance starting with loan receivables we expect our compelling value propositions and the broad utility of our products will continue to drive purchase volume growth we also expect payment rates to continue to moderate although we anticipate they will remain above prepandemic levels through together these dynamics should deliver ending loan receivables growth of to we expect full year net interest income of billion to billion net interest income should follow typical seasonal trends through the year adjusted for several impacts one higher interestbearing liabilities expense as our fixed rate debt reprices with higher benchmark rates two the impact of competition for retail deposits and pace of deposit repricing once rate cuts begin our expectation is for betas to trend near as rates begin to decline later in the year thereby reducing impact to interest expense during and three interest and fee yield growth partially offset by higher income reversals we expect net chargeoffs of to within our targeted underwriting range of to losses are expected to peak in the first half before returning to prepandemic seasonal trends following the normalization of delinquency metrics in we expect rsas of to of average loan receivables for the full year this reflects the impact of continued credit normalization higher interest expense and the mix of our loan receivables growth partially offset by purchase volume growth the reduction in rsa demonstrates the functional design of the rsa and the continued alignment of our interest with partners and finally we expect to reach an operating efficiency ratio of to for the year driven primarily by the optimization of our loan yields as credit normalization occurs this outlook excludes the impact of the pets best gain on sale which we recognize in other income we remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year and continue to invest in the longterm success for our business as demonstrated again this past year synchronys purposebuilt business and financial model is performing as designed through an evolving backdrop our diversified portfolio of products and platforms continue to drive growth our leading credit management ensures attractive riskadjusted returns our rsa provides a buffer against changes in economic performance and our stable balance sheet creates opportunity taken together our business continued to deliver value for each of our stakeholders in and its positioned well for synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian synchrony delivered another strong performance in we executed on key strategic priorities that expand the breadth and depth of our customer acquisition and engagement further diversify the products services and value we provide and enhance the quality of the experiences we power for our customers partners providers and merchants this focus on deepening our core strengths while continuing to evolve with the everchanging world of commerce has enabled synchrony to deliver strong financial results and returns to our shareholders while also preparing our business for the future we are confident in our ability to continue to sustainably grow and deliver resilient riskadjusted returns over time and are excited about both the near and longerterm opportunities we see ahead to deliver still greater value for our many stakeholders with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions as a reminder please limit yourself to one primary question and one followup question well take our first question from terry ma with barclays please go ahead terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc thanks good morning can you maybe just talk about the cadence we should expect for delinquencies in should the fourth quarter or first quarter be kind of peak delinquencies and then as we look forward out to can you maybe just talk about your confidence level that youll stay within this net chargeoff range of to brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial sure thanks terry when we look at our delinquency formation really in the fourth quarter first i think you have to recognize we normalize slower than all of our peers which is partially attributable to the fact that we didnt really adjust the credit box during the pandemic our advanced underwriting tool prism which we invested heavily in since and the data elements we bring in so that really helped the formation as we exit out of its important to note that when you look at both the 30plus and the 90plus days delinquency rate that is in the fourth quarter there are only basis points and basis points respectively over the threeyear average from synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 to so and then when i look at the mix of credit that sits in delinquency today its substantially similar to that of the credit mix so when i look at that i then look a little bit at the trending terry and performance of delinquency when you look at it the consistency of the growth monthonmonth yearoveryear and 30plus 90plus days has not shown deterioration its been very consistent a range between basis points and basis points each month 90plus days has been between basis points and basis points so its been very consistent relative to seasonality its been generally in line so i look at those factors as we kind of enter entry rate continues to be better than so now as i roll that forward what we expect from a chargeoff perspective is that your first half chargeoffs are going to be higher in the first half lower in the second half and should give you a range of to perhaps for the year so inside of our underwriting target again recall that we did take actions in the second quarter and the third quarter which we outlined those are beginning to cede and you should see the effects of those beginning in to affect delinquencies here in the first half of so with that we feel good about where credit is well continue to monitor the trends in credit whats rolling in but the positive entry rate which has a slightly negative effect on the floattoloss but that positive entry rate is really encouraging for us as we enter the year terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc got it thank you and then my followups on just an nii guide looks like you assume about two rate cuts can you maybe just talk about what we should expect if we get more than kind of two rate cuts for the year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for that question terry if i look at what were projecting we actually have three rate cuts really beginning in september of going through the end of the year which ill hit the point on betas its so if you think about having rate cuts that late in the year digital banks generally lag about to days with regard to when they start to move rates and then you also have to take into consideration the fact that its in the fourth quarter when you want to maintain a higher level of financing to fund seasonal growth so thats why the beta is a little bit lower if you were to get rate increases either more than that or earlier in the year you would get in theory some benefit onto the managers margin and lower interest on interestbearing liabilities terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks terry operator our next question comes from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 thanks everybody for taking my questions this morning really just want to talk a little bit about the relationship between ncos and rsas when we look at the guidance guidance from an nco perspective basically puts you at the higher end but within the range of nco targets rsa looks a little bit lower than what we would have seen on a prepandemic basis and im assuming thats really not a function of credit but more a function of interest rates and as we look forward if we assume net chargeoffs wind up in that to target range but interest rates start to come down will the rsa trend back up i just want to sort of get a sense of what we should be looking at in a normal environment for that rsa ratio brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial sure thank you rick the first thing im going to continue to point you to page of our materials this morning which shows the riskadjusted return and really the relationship between ncos and rsa which generally trend in line with each other you are right as you think about you do see some lift continuing on the net chargeoff line which pulls back through the rsa you continue to get headwinds as the interestbearing liabilities will reset we have of our cds will reset in of our debt will reset in so youre going to have a full year effect of the rate increases that weve seen in and flow through the book and again were expecting i think in the guidance we said listen payment rate does not get back to pre pandemic level so youre not getting the full interest and fee yield going back through you have higher interest bearing liabilities which will in theory benefit the company through a low rsa to the extent that interestbearing liabilities comes down faster through other resets you would see an increase to the rsa richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thats it for me thank you guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks rick brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks rick have a good day operator our next question comes from ryan nash with the goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc good morning guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc brian maybe as a followup to the first question i just wanted to flesh out the nii and nim guide a little bit more can you maybe just talk about one what gets us to the bottom end of the range to the top of the range obviously its a pretty wide range and maybe just explain a little bit further what is the beta is that a point topoint is that a downside i just want to make sure we fully understand that and lastly just given that youre liabilitysensitive on the way up do you still see a path to a nim and over what timeframe thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question ryan so let me deal with the beta comment first so when you think about beta this is really the beta in year for really effectively the end of the year i think if you think about betas over a longer period of time so think about what you would see in a rate decline cycle here i would not expect a beta of we didnt get one on the way up so we wouldnt get one on the way down when you look at our portfolio of liabilities we were approximately beta on savings beta on cds i would expect that over that cycle coming down so over time youre going to see it kind of probably mirror the way it went up it will mirror on the way down so thats how i would think about betas over the longer term when you think about the net interest income the question here becomes what is the assumptions if you go we have three rate cuts in the market has six some have as early as march so most certainly if interestbearing liabilities starts earlier and theres greater rate decline that could push your nii dollars up conversely if rates dont get cut off it could push you a little bit lower and the big other factor thats going to come through here is going to be what does payment rate continue to do we have been conservative i think on payment rates saying it doesnt get back to prepandemic levels i think its been slower than our anticipated decline here in so those are generally the moving pieces as i think how you would slide between the range of billion to billion ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe as a followup on credit you talked about starting to see delinquencies follow more normal patterns and also charges peaking by the second quarter brian if your outlook proves to be correct when do we start to see the allowance coming down when does it peak and come down and maybe just help us understand the potential magnitude that it could come down over the course of the year thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so were entering the year at on a coverage rate basis i would expect in the first quarter youre going to see a rise a normally seasonally rise as your receivables go down number one number indiscernible of just under million or around million for the ally lending portfolio that we bring over there will be some on the purchase account in march that will increase that coverage rate a little bit as well it doesnt go through the pl synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 so youre going to see a rise really in the first quarter call it seasonally we anticipate that it will be lower than the as we exit out of so youre primarily going to see growth builds as we move throughout the year but you will see rate declines some of the qas burn off or get realized and again if credit performs as we think it would youd be exiting down towards the day one we wont be at day one most certainly in but trending downwards as we move through the year ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color brian brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks ryan operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with td cowen please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks i know that your guidance doesnt contemplate the late fee ruling yet because it hasnt been issued but maybe could you you did mention that you spent million kind of in preparation could you talk about the things that you are doing in preparation and kind of any updated thoughts you have on the fact that were sitting here kind of towards the end of january and havent heard anything yet from the cfpb brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure moshe ill start on this were obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued but with that said while theres still some unknowns in terms of the implementation period and other things that well see in the final rule weve been working on this for almost a full year now at this point its very complicated our teams have done a lot of work in preparation for this weve spent a lot of time with our partners weve agreed on pricing actions and offsets that we would deploy when we see the final rule so its really all the work that has been going on over the past year i mean its systems work you have to issue a lot of cits change in terms and so its really that kind of stuff i will say that the conversations with our partners have been very constructive they fully recognize that without these offsets that a meaningful portion of their customers that we approve today and that we underwrite and give credit to would no longer have access to credit and thats something clearly we do not want they do not want so really no change to what we said in the past our goal is to protect our partners fully offset the impact of the final rule when it does come and we want to continue to provide credit to the customers that we do today moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks and just kind of as a second thought when you look at the different kind of verticals obviously you had strong growth in and a couple of them in home auto had been somewhat weaker particularly as you got closer to yearend as you look into any changes in mix in terms of the growth anything that youre seeing or launches and product refreshes that are going to drive in those various lines synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i think look generally we would continue to expect outsized growth in health wellness thats a platform where we have accelerated investment in the past year or two were seeing really good growth from our acquisition of allegro credit its a big market weve got a leading position this is dental vet cosmetic great engagement of partner network and so thats a platform well continue to invest in and we would expect to see growth there on the higher side relative to the other platforms the other one i would mention is digital thats where weve got venmo verizon paypal amazon and so i think youd continue to see some outsized growth there and then maybe a little bit softer in lifestyle and home auto i dont know brian if youd add anything to that brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial no you hit it youll see health wellness in digital will be above average diversified value will be around company average maybe a hair below and then youll see lifestyle and listen the home auto trend particularly in home what were seeing there is lower foot traffic in the store and we see frequency not necessarily terribly down but its more transaction values are people are if theyre buying a mattress theyre not buying a highend mattress theyre buying a little bit lower so we would expect that trend to continue into the start of moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen thanks very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks moshe brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe operator our next question comes from john hecht with jeffries please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning and thanks for taking my questions guys most of my questions have been asked and answered but i guess one of the questions i have is i think weve had depleted recoveries on the chargeoffs side part of that equation over the past couple of years im wondering brian to what degree does maybe a recovery in recoveries impact the nco guide brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 yeah thanks for the question john and good morning when we look at recoveries weve done a couple of things related to the pandemic number one we made a strategic shift to insource our recovery operations so where we used to have a lot of it externallymanaged we brought it inhouse which effectively drove rate increases on the ultimate recoverability of dollars written off so that was a positive as we moved through you are right when you look at particularly when youre doing some level of forward flow on a rate basis thats down and your total chargeoffs are down but i think the swing that we had of being more efficient by insourcing has helped offset that so i think on a relative percentage its been flat most certainly it should rise as we step out of for a couple of reasons number one youre right well get more volume just on a net chargeoff basis and then if you do see an easing of rates the cost of capital associated with people who purchase writtenoff paper should go down and youll get better pricing in the market so theres a number of different dynamics for us that it hasnt been much of an issue on our net chargeoffs and probably exiting out of maybe provides it a tailwind beyond john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay and maybe kind of a higherlevel question i think brian i think you mentioned you still you have non discretionary versus discretionary purchase activity was consistent im wondering i mean given inflation is stabilizing weve got student loan repayment turned back on are you seeing anything on the margin that would reflect changing consumer behavior or has it just sort of been steady as she goes given those changes in the macro brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah as we highlighted it john what were seeing is a little bit of rotation out of some of travel into some of the other items again that was a trend more in the fourth quarter we would expect travel to ease as you move into so thats a bigger shift we do not see the shift between discretionary and nondiscretionary we do not see a shift where the consumer is trying to really stretch dollars we do see our transaction values down and frequency up a little bit which means that as the consumer is making purchases they are trying to be efficient with the dollars but not really pulling back so as i look at that i dont see big overwhelming trends i would tell you for the first days and i always put that as a frame of reference sales have been a little bit softer than expectations as we entered into but thats only days of data and if i talked to some of my retail friends they would tell you weather did play a factor as you had several states that had been cold and significant storms but theres been lower foot traffic generally across the board as we started john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great i appreciate the color brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you john have a good day operator our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc oh good morning and thank you for taking my questions maybe to start with i wanted to ask about portfolio renewals and just portfolio movements and i apologize its a twopart question but firstly can you just remind us of your renewal cadence are there any large programs coming up for renewal here in the next months and then second part is just weve gone through a period of credit normalization you still have the rate late fee rule outstanding so i was wondering what the environment is like for renewals and rfps currently as you talk to retailers are retailers waiting for a little bit more certainty or i mean i know you announced jcrew this morning youre also buying the ally portfolio but like what about the other big retail programs dont you send like can you put your pipeline in context maybe like what it looks like and just put that into context for us relative to last year or a few years ago on a normal environment thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah yeah so i would say first ill take the second part first which is late fees and how thats impacting the pipeline i do think it does make pricing new business even renewals to some extent a little more challenging but weve been able to kind of work through that you mentioned jcrew were excited to announce that new program but youve got to spend time thats part of the negotiation right and theres speculation there and theres some uncertainty and so you kind of got to try and cover yourself for those possible outcomes which we believe weve done so it does make i think pricing new business or renewals a little more challenging i do think therell be some clarity here in the next month or two and thatll clear that up and make things a little bit easier from that perspective but it has influenced i think not only us but other market participants its a big part of the conversation once you get through the way i think about the kind of the bd or the sales process its a lot about capabilities technology data analytics data share all those things but then when you get to the financials this is a big part of the discussion thats crept in there over the last months just given the uncertainty the other thing just in terms of our pipeline for renewals the vast majority of our programs are out there and beyond with that said if we have an opportunity as always if we have an opportunity to renew early if theres something the partner wants to change in the deal or something we want to change well get together and see if we can kick the term out a few years so thats something were always actively trying to work on with our partners brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah mihir the only thing ill answer is or just add but youll see in february again well continue to update the revenue thats under contract in january and beyond so expect that in february synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc excellent thank you and then just switching gears in terms of the health of the consumer it sounds like stable still feel pretty good about it so i was wondering about your underwriting posture here clearly soft landing is becoming more of a consensus view i know you arent prone to big gyrations there but how are you feeling about that underwriting posture maybe just talk about like what your standards look like today versus maybe one year ago or even is this like like more of a normal year is there is it still a little on the tight side and the opportunity to loosen and drive growth just any comments there brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah mihir again its gotten a lot of issues and trouble as they try to underwrite growth in the and vintages which people are paying the price for now some refer to it as growth mass some refer to it as loosened standards and lower returns so were not going to use credit as a mere growth lever for us we are more prudent than we were a year ago again we talked about we do idiosyncratic actions on partners and channels i dont want to say every day but most certainly we watch it every day we took broaderbased actions both in and given the shared consumer and what other people have done from an underwriting basis we were slightly encouraged in the fourth quarter as weve seen at the bureaus that other issuers have begun to take credit actions which will benefit the industry in the latter part of but i think were going to be cautious as we move throughout the year were going to continue to watch the trends of the consumer again we havent seen the consumer stretch when we look at payment rates the payment rate movements by credit rate have been relatively consistent and probably the biggest mover has been in the to range then which youve see in a nonprime person so again we look at it and say okay i dont see the consumer stretching from a spending standpoint and struggling we dont see the payment rate changing were going to continue to watch the flow and the delinquency again entry rate continues to be better than which again the floattoloss gets worse whenever entry rate goes down but we generally were generally cautiously optimistic on credit and which is reflected in the guide of to mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks mihir have a good day operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning brian doubles you were pretty active on the transactions front with the sale of the pet insurance business and part of the business and then the acquisition of the ally lending business could you just maybe give a little bit more on sort of what drove those decisions and then what the pipeline for the other deals synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 look like i mean i think theres one big fish at least out there in terms of a portfolio so if you could talk about what the positioning is there brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah let me well why dont i start with ally because its the more recent of the two transactions i mean look i think were super excited about this acquisition i think its actually great for both companies these were conversations that ph jd and i started back in the first half of i think this wasnt a scale business for ally but on our side this is absolutely a scale business this is exactly the type of acquisition that we look for these are businesses and industries that we know really well we obviously have a presence already in home improvement and health wellness in fact as we got into this we realized that we serve some of the same partners so as i think about ally it really just complements and accelerates our current strategy i also think that and brian covered this its got a very attractive financial profile its etfs accretive its got a nice roa thatll be in line or maybe a little bit better than the company average we get new merchants we get new customers so theres really a lot to like here i mean this is a nice bolton acquisition for us and will be a nice add for both home auto but also health wellness and then pets best was really more opportunistic we werent looking to sell the pet insurance business its been a great business for us were obviously creating a lot of value in a relatively short period of time we did a great job growing the business from we grew the pets in force over we took the business to number seven or number eight to the number four pet insurance provider in the us and when iph approached us it was a great offer tough to turn it down its over our original investment were recording nice aftertax gain but i think more importantly than that it allows us to stay invested in the pet space and do it with someone a great partner like iph that has the scale that has the expertise and so we think theres not only a nice financial gain but a longterm strategic play here thatll benefit us so its a nice way to close out the year with two i think really great transactions sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc other deals what else is out there brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial sorry sanjay one more say that again sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah you were saying i asked sort of what else might be out there brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial oh synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one big portfolio out there i know yeah brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah look we got a lot on our plate id start with that we got to get both of these transactions closed which we hope to do in the first quarter we got a lot going on in for sure with that said we typically get invited into most rfps in this space and the things that are important to us havent changed we look for a good risk adjusted return we look for really good alignment with the partner i think thats probably the most important thing particularly when youre looking at large deals you got to make sure that both partners like the deal in good times and bad times that our interests are aligned around marketing and credit and underwriting and really all aspects of the program so well always be in the market for opportunities that fit that screen sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and just one followup i guess brian wenzel like in your reserve coverage what or for the year what are you assuming for the unemployment rate specifically brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the unemployment rate as we exit out of is sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it all right great thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks sanjay have a good day operator our next question comes from jeff adelson with morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions last year you ended up seeing your loan growth come in above initial expectations of that kind of initial to i guess im wondering if you think theres maybe some potential upside or a similar setup this year and then more specifically could you talk a little bit more about the specific drivers that you see getting you to the low end versus the high end of the range there in that to in terms of payment rate consumer spend new account growth and maybe even how additive you think that this installment opportunity could be to your growth it seems like youre maybe leaning in a little bit more here with the acquisition and the prequalification launch this year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah when i look at the growth rate jeff what gets you to the lower end of the range is a couple of things potentially right a softer consumer right the macroeconomic environment softens up number one number two payment rate remains more elevated than we anticipate you could be at the lower end of that range the credit actions weve taken deliver more of a sales impact than we expected and its not material in whole that could put you at the low end of the range conversely as you think about the high end of the range if payment rates declined faster than we think number one if you see the economy maybe be a little bit more robust than what were seeing on we gave you a gdp growth rate there but if the economys a little more robust and we see spending elevate you can see some more there with regard to most certainly the home specialty thats been a vertical inside of home auto that has grown nicely for us will continue to grow nicely forward its really not going to move the company average so its a nice acquisition the acquisition itself is not necessarily generally going to be material enough to move a lot of the underlying metrics youll get the pop they day one and most certainly it will grow as we create the synergies between our home specialty platform and whats a very attractive ally lending pointofsale platform so the combination will grow a little bit faster but it shouldnt move the overall needle of the company jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and just a followup on the new expense ratio guide i know in the past youve given more of a quarterly dollar amount it seems like you might be implying a very lowsingle digit type expense growth next year is that right and where do you think youre kind of gaining some efficiencies from here is it on marketing lower comp et cetera brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so first of all on the switch to really efficiency ratio jeff if you recall a number of years ago we were actually on efficiency ratio and thats where weve guided the long term we pivoted during the pandemic because of the implications to revenue because of the payment rate dislocation that we saw so were trying to be more helpful to investors and analysts by going to dollars now were just really migrating back to where we should be from an efficiency ratio standpoint and where the industry generally operates number one with regard to the expense dollars if i look at controllable dollars so if i take operational losses out again we can control them but take that out for one second and you remove marketing which is more contractual for us based upon volume we are growing expenses at a slower rate so were getting operating leverage inside the company weve made several investments as you saw in our notable items both on a voluntary early retirement program as well as some smaller but again meaningful impacts to our facilities that will drive a benefit in so i think from a controllable expense standpoint there are going to be youre going to see operating leverage when it comes to that with regard to operational losses weve invested in some incremental tools that have there some new strategies so we expect that growth rate to really flatten out as you move to jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 great thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks jeff have a good day operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just have a couple of followups on the late fee topic i guess in terms of the offsets can you just remind us what is likely to be the most material mechanism in offsetting the impact of the late fees is it incremental fees or the underlying interest rate that youre dialing in and then secondly can you talk about the competition who are negotiating the offsets that you indicated are in place how heavy is it in terms of competition are there competitors out there willing to eat the cost and could you possibly see any relationships move as a result of this brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah let me start with the second one first i think look were all on a level playing field here in terms of the new late fee proposal so as were in there trying to whether its a renewal or a new business the impact is the same i think it all comes down to what is the issuers required rate of return what are the things that are important to them so i dont see it changing the competitive dynamic much because it impacts us all equally it really depends on the type of portfolio whats important to the partner the sharing the alignment all the things that i talked about so i dont think itll have i dont see it having a big impact there and particularly at the point in which we have some clarity here around a final rule then i think it becomes even clearer in terms of what to bake in and brian why dont you talk a little bit about the aprs and fees brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so obviously john we have a set of pricing strategy changes that will come through some of which come through with a faster cadence in which will be feeoriented as well as some policy orientation and then there will be apr increases that build with some which youll see in if the rule gets issued and then build into so well be back if the rule does get issued well come back and probably provide a little bit more color with regard to how to think about that in the context of brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial some of these will have a bigger short term impact some of them will have a bigger long term impact and so well be in a position to provide a little more clarity when we have a final rule and we start to roll out some of these actions synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thank you and then secondly just around your purchase volume i appreciate the color you gave in terms of the drivers between the different verticals overall as were looking at whats your expectation for total card purchase volume or overall purchase volume as you look at the full year versus and the same for overall account growth thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so id say were not specifically guiding john on purchase volume obviously youve seen the rate of asset growth decline from there was some impact last year really around that asset growth stemming from payment rates decline which again we dont think it will have as big an impact in so i think youre going to see something generally consistent with probably last year i mean a good benchmark is sit back and say we do see gdp at we grow a multiple of that so again probably generally consistent with the last year or two youve got to remember too our purchase volume at billion for was a record high for this company so we are facing a difficult comp as we move into but again were proud of the sales platforms and the differentiation and diversification thats inside of those platforms john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john have a good day operator our last question will come from mark devries with deutsche bank please go ahead mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks wanted to ask about your thoughts around preferred equity issuance for this year brian does that need to be additive to the capital levels or does it free you up to replace some of that with or return some common talk a little bit about potential timing what you kind of need to see from a market perspective and also how much you might look to issue brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks for the question mark as we look at the capital stack we fully developed our tier we have about basis points give or take of capacity in tier which puts the max amount you probably can do just to reach the target level for tier of about million million to million ultimately that youd want to do we dont necessarily think of that relative to common equity as more as we want to develop most certainly the most cost effective capital structure that we want the timing of which is going to depend upon market conditions rates throughout were incredibly high and wasnt necessarily the best time to kind of issue it well look at how the market has developed in and whether or not theres desired investor demand for the products and well also look at the structure of whether or not thats a more retailoriented preferred stock or not so theres a synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 number of different factors that just really goes into how do i fully develop all the levels of the capital stack from a regulatory standpoint mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just to followup on kind of your updated thoughts on plans for how to deploy the capital created by the pets best sale brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i dont think our priority has changed i mean we generate some capital in by making some adjustments well spend about basis points of capital on the ally transaction well generate about basis points on the pets best sale and net of the investment that were taking back in iph so i think that kind of goes into the pie and we will look to the priorities of organic growth number one maintaining the dividend two and then three well look either at share repurchases or if theres other inorganic opportunities again i think were very focused when it comes to inorganic opportunities it has to be the right thing it has to be priced incredibly well which we feel we got with ally lending and so well be prudent when it comes to deploying that capital but again were not changing the strategy or the cadence because of the pets best transaction mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks mark have a good day brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mark mark devries q
