financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today once again regions delivered another solid quarter underscoring our commitment to generating consistent sustainable longterm performance we generated earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of despite recent events in the banking industry we remain focused on the fundamentals and things we can control weve spent over a decade enhancing our interest rate risk credit risk capital and liquidity management frameworks our relationship based banking approach coupled with our favorable geographic footprint uniquely positions us to weather an uncertain market backdrop further balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet have been a key focus for years as a result we are wellpositioned to withstand an array of economic conditions approximately of our deposits are retail deposits these deposits tend to be granular and less rate sensitive in fact approximately of these deposits are insured our strategy focuses on primacy and customer loyalty we want to be in our customers primary banking relationship this strategy is evident in the fact that over of our consumer checking households include a highquality checking account and over of consumer checking deposit balances are with customers that have been with regions for years or more our wholesale or business services deposits are also highly diversified from an industry size and geography perspective with approximately of deposits that are either insured operational in nature or collateralized in total approximately of our deposits across all business lines are insured or collateralized by securities and our deposits are with customers we know has over reside within our 15state footprint further supporting our highquality deposit franchise we had access to total primary liquidity of approximately billion at the end of the quarter sufficient to cover uninsured retail and nonoperational wholesale deposits by regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 more than a to ratio if you include access to the federal reserves discount window available liquidity increases to billion or approximately to coverage we have a strong team of bankers and the recent disruption has given us an opportunity to connect with our customers and top prospects to answer questions and reassure them of our stability weve experienced some deposit outflows as corporate treasuries look to diversify and sought higher interest rates for their excess cash however weve also experienced deposit inflows from new and existing customers importantly our total deposits at march were roughly unchanged from what they were prior to the onset of liquidity concerns in the industry a majority of the billion deposit decrease this quarter was as expected due primarily to further normalization in corporate deposits which had dramatically increased during the pandemic as well as a continuation of rate seeking behavior in certain wealth and higher balance consumer accounts from a lending perspective our focus on riskadjusted returns continues overall sentiment among our corporate customers remains positive while most are forecasting strong performance in they are expecting modest declines from levels seen in while current market conditions warrant heightened caution we believe our strong liquidity profile provides an advantage in terms of supporting our customers borrowing needs in closing despite all the industry turmoil we feel very good about our balance sheet and strong liquidity position and through our proactive hedging strategies we are positioned for success in any interest rate environment our granular deposit base and relationshipbased banking model continue to serve us well and were proud to continue supporting our customers banking needs now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans increased sequentially average business loans increased compared to the prior quarter reflecting highquality broadbased growth across the utilities retail trade and financial services industries approximately of this growth was again driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses average consumer loans increased as growth in mortgage and interbank was partially offset by continued paydowns in home equity and runoff exit portfolios looking forward we continue to expect ending loan growth of approximately from a deposit standpoint our deposit base remains a strength and competitive advantage with balances continuing to largely perform as expected previously we indicated that combination of rapidly rising interest rates and normalization of surge deposits would likely lead to billion to billion of deposit declines by midyear before we would begin to generate net deposit growth while the events in march created turmoil in the banking industry we continue to believe that range is appropriate however we may be at the higher end of the range as we approach midyear the preponderance of deposit outflows this quarter occurred prior to early march and were in line with our expectations approximately billion of the billion outflow came from corporate deposits reflecting normal seasonal activity the other billion came from a continuation of rate seeking behavior among certain wealth and higher balance consumer clients the same characteristics that contribute to our deposit advantage in a rising rate environment regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 are also helpful in a time of systemic volatility as john noted our focus on attracting and retaining a diverse and granular deposit base with high primacy drives loyalty and trust and instills funding stability so lets shift to net interest income and margin net interest income continued to expand with market interest rates in the first quarter reflecting our assetsensitive profile and funding stability net interest income grew linked quarter to a record billion and net interest margin increased basis points to as the federal reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lowyielding loans and securities generated through the pandemic at this stage in the rate cycle we expect accelerating deposit costs through repricing and remixing importantly recent trends remain within our expectation the cycle to date deposit beta is and our guidance for is unchanged a fullcycle beta by year end we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for regions when compared to the broader industry net interest income is projected to grow between and in when compared to the midpoint of the range is supported by the march market forward yield curve which projects nearly basis points of rate cuts in and stable fed funds level would push net interest income to the upper end of the range the balance sheet hedging program is an important source of our earnings stability in todays uncertain environment hedges added todate create a wellprotected net interest margin profile through forward starting receivefixed swaps will become effective in the latter half of and and generally have a term of three years activity in the first quarter focused on extending that protection beyond in addition to forwardstarting swaps we added a billion collar strategy selling rate caps to pay for rate floors to limit exposure to extreme market rate movements the resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of to over the coming years even if interest rates move back towards if rates remain elevated our net interest margin is projected to remain above the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice so lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income declined from the prior quarter as modest increases in service charges and wealth management income were offset by declines in other categories primarily capital markets and card and atm fees service charges increased slightly as seasonally higher treasury management fees offset declines in overdraft fees excluding the impact of cva and dva capital markets increased sequentially as growth in real estate capital markets loan syndications and debt and securities underwriting more than offset declines in ma fees and commercial swaps we did have a negative million cva and dva adjustment reflecting lower longterm interest rates volatility in credit spreads as well as a refinement in our valuation methodology card and atm fees were negatively impacted by a million increase in reserves driven by higher reward redemption rates with respect to our outlook and incorporating first quarter results we expect fullyear adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior quarter salaries and benefits increased primarily due to merit and a seasonal increase in payroll taxes fdic insurance assessment reflects the previously announced industrywide increase in the assessment rate schedules regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 in contrast to the prior two years we expect first half adjusted expenses to be higher than the second half of the year and we continue to expect fullyear adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to we now expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately from an asset quality standpoint overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected net chargeoffs were basis points in the quarter nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased while total delinquencies decreased provision expense was million while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at the amount of the allowance increased due primarily to economic changes and normalizing credit from historically low levels partially offset by a reduction associated with the elimination of the accounting for troubled debt restructured loans it is worth noting the outcome of the most recent shared national credit exam is reflected in our results ill take a few minutes to speak to our commercial real estate portfolio since we have deliberately limited our exposure to this space at quarter end our exposure totaled of loans excluding owner occupied and it is highly diverse this total includes billion of investor real estate and billion of unsecured exposure of which the vast majority is within real estate investment trust our reit clients generally have low leverage and strong access to liquidity with classified as investmentgrade importantly total office represents just of total loans at billion of note consist of class a properties with located within the sunbelt the office portfolio was originated with an approximate weighted average loantovalue of and we have stressed the portfolio to include a discount using the green street commercial property price index with a weighted average resulting loantovalue of the book approximating it is also noteworthy that of our secured office portfolio is singletenant while we are carefully monitoring conditions we believe our portfolio will be able to weather the weakness in the industry including first quarter results we now expect our full year net chargeoff ratio to be approximately basis points given the recent economic uncertainty and market volatility we may see a pickup in the pace of normalization towards our throughthecycle annual chargeoff range of to basis points over time from a capital standpoint we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio at an estimated reflecting solid capital generation through earnings partially offset by continued loan growth and approximately million or basis points related to the phasein of cecl into regulatory capital given current macroeconomic conditions and regulatory uncertainty we anticipate managing capital levels at or modestly above over the near term so in closing we delivered solid results in the first quarter despite volatile conditions we have balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet and are wellpositioned to withstand an array of economic conditions were in some of the strongest markets in the country and while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers pretax preprovision income remained strong expenses are well controlled credit remains broadly stable and capital and liquidity levels remain robust regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 with that well move to the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions please hold while we compile the qa roster thank you our first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ryan david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc david maybe a question on betas and deposit balances so you guys are one of the few that isnt increasing your deposit beta guidance given that youre at and i think expectations are for can you maybe just talk about where you expect the pressure to come from i think you noted in the remarks repricing and remixing how much will each of these contribute are you expecting more to be in retail given the push for insured deposits or is it on the commercial side and then second you noted that you do expect to see stabilization of growth in balances later in the year can you maybe just talk about what you see driving that as we move through the year thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so as weve mentioned before we had billion worth of surge deposits we didnt think those would stay with us as long as they actually have stayed with us and weve furthermore said as rates continue to increase that people would be seeking higher returns than we were offering at the time and so you can see our cumulative beta as you mentioned at well below everybody else we do understand that were going to end up theres going to be a shift to deposits into cds more expensive deposits and so we do also expect some continued runoff we have given you the guide of billion to billion and were now billion we expect to be at the upper end of that by the end of the second quarter and a lot of that is putting money to work and businesses but also some seeking higher rates and so its a combination of where we are relative to our deposit cost relative to the peers would imply that we would be increasing some of that over time and thats going to drive our beta and we still believe is the right number by the end of the cycle which were calling the end of this year regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe as a followup so you guys are now expecting losses at the high end of your previous guidance it looks like the increase this quarter was driven by ci and i think david i think you just noted you could see a pickup in the pace of normalization can you maybe just talk about one what is driving the incremental pressure and what are you expecting to be the higher driver of chargeoffs both for the rest of this year and then the pace of normalization that we could see thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well so as weve stated many times the chargeoff level is below normal and we said it would be normalizing over time weve furthermore set our normalized loss rate based on the risk profile we maintain a basis points to basis points as we get through the end of this year were trying to give you the message that that could kind of lead you into a run rate towards that basis points to basis points by the end of the year were already at basis points this quarter which would imply we expect a reduction in chargeoffs and the second andor third quarter but all in we still think were going to be at basis points which is below normal so we have a lot of confidence in that we had certain things that happened in the first quarter we dont think will repeat and so i think our basis points is a pretty good number john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah ryan id just add to the question about where were seeing the stress weve identified a couple of areas on previous calls where we are experiencing some stress in the portfolio that would be health care where were seeing rising cost and pressure on labor transportation particularly on the smaller end of the transportation sector where customers are competing in the spot market to move product consumer discretionary where consumers are changing their buying patterns and moving away from more discretionary items towards services where were seeing some pressure office obviously and then senior housing which is a sector that we believe is improving but still not returned to occupancy levels that we experienced prior to pandemic and again its a sector where labor is a factor and the operations of those businesses and driving cost up so those are all areas where we are seeing more pressure than in the rest of the portfolio and i would finally comment i think well see some additional movement toward normalization but we probably gotten there a little faster than i think we thought we would so we dont expect a whole lot of additional deterioration as we move toward normalization ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color john david john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is for david you continue to have that line about a longterm nim of to i think investors are starting to think about rate cuts in and im loath to always ask about but i think investors are thinking about how inexpensive bank stocks are really right trying to evaluate them on what could be trough earnings next year so if the fed cuts can you still stay within that range and i think nobodys expecting a cut to zero but perhaps walk us through the scenario of that range in the scenario of like a 200basispoint cut over one year david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so the bottom line answer is yes we do feel comfortable under any scenario as we mentioned that we would operate in that to range clearly our guidance is based on the market i mean on the march forward it has three cuts basis points worth of cuts after one increase so to the extent that were to happen we will still be within that range if it stays higher than that then wed be at the upper end of the range and we have some receivefixed swaps that actually come onboard in the second half of the year to protect us from lower rates were not saying that the rates will be cut thats what the market says i personally dont see that that will happen at that pace but we wanted to be able to center the discussion on what the markets seeing and thats why we gave you that and then we gave you some sensitivity around it so we feel very good about the range where we are in the range there are a whole lot of factors the pace the timing of cuts that would take us down even if we had a couple of hundred basis points of cuts in were still in the range so does that get you what you wanted erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes and as we think about perhaps a more measured pace of cut how would you anticipate being able to formalize your deposit costs in that backdrop david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp say that again how would we say it again erika regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yeah how quickly could you lower deposit costs in an environment where the fed is cutting in a measured pace im just trying to think about the other side as i think about sort of your longterm nim target range david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah well so you could see our deposit cost relative to our peers at a bear are lagging and so the ability to cut we have to be competitive we have to offer a fair price to our customer base and i think to the extent you start seeing a pause andor cuts coming from the fed the beta that we just mentioned could change and may not be as severe what happens is the increase in deposit costs lagged the last increase of that the fed is going to have so itll take some time for that to manifest itself so if you look at the retail side the retail side is very slow to react but on the commercial side its almost instantaneous as treasurers look to lock in the best yield that they can we have some index deposits that move with changes in fed funds so thatll react pretty quickly which i think is a benefit to us in that scenario erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yes good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi in terms of your maintaining the cumulative or throughcycle beta i hear you where youre trending out and youre confident but im just curious how the liquidity crisis through march and how it really impacted that outlook we saw a number of other banks increase their deposit beta their expectations given the intensifying pressure around deposit costs as well as broader funding costs so how has the liquidity crisis impacted your view and how does that not influence an increase in how youre thinking about the throughcycle data if you could just walk us through that thanks regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah john so our this is our competitive advantage is our deposit base and so we havent had to react at the pace of others so if you look at the incremental beta of our core peer group that was some this quarter and ours was so we just havent had to move at the pace and i still think based on how we fund ourselves the core retail of our deposits being retail really has helped us from being able to keep that beta where it is at so as we think about some of the larger customers that are seeking rates seeking returns thats where there has been more competitive pressure and we saw some of that being put to work in the first quarter and we called for some of that thats part of the billion to billion that were talking about as a matter of fact in our beta assumption we had all that coming out of noninterestbearing that wasnt quite what we saw but we assumed noninterestbearing because that was more conservative to give you the guidance and so if you take all that into consideration i think thats why you didnt see us change our cumulative beta to and being at theres a long way to go from to we understand that but if we miss it maybe its a tad underneath that which is why we gave you also some guidance on our slide number that would show you if beta was a little bit better than how much it might be john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks david thats helpful and then separately on the capital front i know you increased your target to and so just if you could or or just above i believe you said if you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the rationale and then could that allow for buybacks at some point how are you thinking about deployment and the pace of where you the timing of when you get to around that range david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so you saw our common equity tier increase from 96to and thats after absorbing about basis points due to the cecl impact for the first quarter so were generating to basis points worth of cet1 every quarter after loan growth we first and foremost want to be here as a source of strength for our customers and be able to make all creditworthy loans we can make and were open for business and ready to do that thats what our job is we want to make sure we pay our shareholders a fair dividend to of our earnings in the form of a dividend and we have been at the lower end of that and then weve used our capital for other nonbank acquisitions and mortgage servicing right acquisitions which wed like to continue and then to optimize our capital well buy stock back from time to time given the uncertainty thats in the market obviously theres a lot of review going on to what happened in the month of march and theres going to be some reports coming out from our regulatory supervisors on what may change and we just want to be prepared for that and we think it would be inappropriate at this time to be buying our stock back when we have this kind of uncertainty you lop on top of that the uncertainty in the economy and monetary policy so theres just a lot of noise which caused us to rethink well lets just wait let us accrete up to that maybe slightly over that and to the extent things settle down then well optimize capital and well use share repurchases as a mechanism to do so regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks david operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc how are you thinking about managing liquidity going forward obviously like with a very strong deposit base youve been less reliant on wholesale borrowing but both in light of current conditions and then just kind of the way the regulation might be moving what are you thinking about in terms of borrowings and then also both cash and securities and again like youve got a smaller afs book than others which has worked well given the move in rates but whats the outlook on both the funding and asset side thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we still believe in growing customer relationships core checking accounts and operating accounts of businesses its the basis of our whole business and well continue to do that from to help us from a liquidity standpoint clearly some things have changed weve given you a list of our total primary liquidity and also liquidity at the discount window should we need it what weve learned i think over this is that it can move much quicker than we all had anticipated the world has changed a bit and so weve had one of the largest cash balances of anybody in the peer group the lower securities but we did that intentionally because we were not clear on those surge deposits on the pace that they would move out so well probably maintain a bit more cash than we historically have been obviously theres a currently theres a new term bank facility that the fed created thats temporary i hope theres a thinking about how to maybe keep some of that in place but we did not use that as you could tell from our disclosures but we tested it after quarter end just to make sure the pipes were worked up and i think we borrowed and repaid it quickly but posting collateral to something like that that you can get access to quickly clearly the federal home loan bank is still our primary source we go to we have a little bit outstanding there at quarter end couple billion regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 dollars and so just having access to multiple levels if we learned anything its diversification and you need to make sure your funding side is diverse and within your deposit base it needs to be diverse so you cant if you end up with a concentration you end up with a problem so i think thats a big lesson learned for everybody and staying as diverse as we can a little more cash on hand i think is in order matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then specifically on the securities book how would you think about that relative to assets kind of near or longer term with the current framework david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp weve historically been in that range of earning assets and we dont see that changing dramatically i think we need to be careful theres been a lot of discussion about shortening up maturities and things of that nature and we need to be real careful because there could be broad implications of that the banking system is a big buyer of mortgagebacked securities and we need to support the mortgage industry and the housing industry and consumers that way so we are forced to go too short there are much broader implications for the economy so were going to be careful of that well see what the policymakers come up with and well adapt and overcome as we see fit but right now i think having a book about where weve been which is a little lower than others i think is the right spot for us based on our again our funding profile matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay understood thank you very much operator our next question comes from line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john and good morning david john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey good morning gerard david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john or david or both of you obviously regions has derisked its balance sheet dramatically from the time period and so i think you guys are in a good position to maybe handle this question specifically for regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 commercial real estate can you guys share with us the differences that you are seeing in the current commercial real estate market in your portfolio versus what it was like in now granted i know youve lowered the exposure so thats a major difference but in terms of the cap rates obviously have moved up the refinancing risk is here but can you share with us how you guys could handle that more im assuming more easily today than what happened in john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah gerard this is john i would say we rebuilt our business beginning in kind of the timeframe recognizing that its a very much specialized business and weve built it around professional real estate bankers who are working with professional real estate developers generally theyre either regional or national developers they have strong capital positions good access to liquidity strong track records theyre operating in some of the primary markets across the us we rebuilt our business with a focus on concentration risk management so its well distributed the portfolio is across different segments of the industry as well as across geographies we have built the business i think very conservative from a structural standpoint requiring good equity in projects and were constantly stressing our exposure its a relationship business for us were transacting with customers who maintain deposit relationships with us who use our capital markets capabilities were very close to those customers and as a consequence we have a very good handle on the exposure that we have across the business and we have the benefit of operating in some of the best markets in the country as well you look at markets like dallas and houston orlando charlotte atlanta nashville where were doing business and where the majority of our portfolio resides we have good good underpinning economy to help support the projects as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and maybe david on a technical question regarding the commercial real estate how does the elimination of tdrs now help or hinder your guys working out with some of your customers that may inevitably have an issue with their property david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well were not going to let an accounting change change our what we are going to do for our customer if we need to have a restructuring then thats what well do and well let the accounting it is what it is so i dont think thatll impact us at all gerard from moving forward just like we always have gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup question another technical one for you david can you just remind us about the cecl being phased into capital just the time range and how that may affect your capital ratios going forward regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah thats roughly the same number you just saw its almost a straight line number over i think is four periods so weve got three more of these coming its million in round numbers gerard in the first quarter of each of the next three years about seven points im sorry two more years and so itll be about a 7basispoint hit to us each of the next two years gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good that was very helpful thank you david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yes sir operator our next question comes from the line of peter winter with da davidson please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning you guys had pretty solid average loan growth this quarter and did maintain the periodend outlook can you just talk about loan demand and then secondly if theres any areas maybe where youre tightening underwriting standards or being more selective at this stage john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so we obviously in this economy we want to be thoughtful about any new relationships that we acquire and any new credit that we book i would like to think that were not changing our underwriting standards that theyre consistent across all economic cycles but at the same time when you think about allocation of capital and lending into this environment we want to be thoughtful and prudent we want to make sure that any new business we get as a result of calling activity thats been ongoing for some time we understand the relationship potential and opportunity that we have a good plan regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 the bulk of the loan growth that weve experienced in the wholesale business has been loans to existing customers and in the last quarter ebitda growth was in our industry verticals particularly in power and utilities energy and the industrial space were also seeing a little growth within our regions business capital business assetbased lending business during this period of time and then on the consumer side mortgage grew and interbank grew as a result of putting mortgage because were generating some arms during the period on balance sheet arms on a period like this i think loan growth clearly or loan pipelines i should say on the wholesale side of the business are down and i think that reflects caution on the part of customers as well as projects just the economy slowing a bit as a result of rising rates and increasing cost we still believe given some of our view of the future and known projects that are either underway or will get underway there is we have an opportunity to grow loans i think were going to about between now and end of the year and we should see growth in the same categories that i just described david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think peter ill add to that as part of the growth outlook it is because of the markets that we operate in weve been the recipient of a lot of migration of people and businesses into where we operate and so our economy here is a bit different than certain other economies around the country and i think that thats given us some confidence that our loan growth is reasonable peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it very helpful and if i could ask about the guidance on the deposit service charges still million question is how should we think about the second half of the year from the impact of that grace period will it step down to i guess around million and could you offset some of that with just account growth and cross selling treasury management services david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yes so you can see that our if you annualize where we ended up in the first quarter we would be above the million and thats an acknowledgment that our last change of 24hour grace actually goes in the beginning of the second of the third quarter and so youre going to see that step down more so in the third and fourth quarter than you have seen because we had made the change one of the things that weve been the recipients of is our treasury management investments weve made on people and technology have really helped offset to some degree at least the decline were seeing from the consumer service charges and we expect that to continue so were up some there in tm and if this continues at that pace we might have a better answer for you next earnings call but right now were calling for million and with a step down in the second half of the year peter j winter q analyst da davidson co okay thanks david regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah hey guys david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey jeff ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc good morning just a followup also on the fee side i know obviously its been a tough start to the year in capital markets and youre reiterating that million to million zones that kind of were in in the first quarter just maybe can you give us color on just how that business is feeling and acting in terms of pipelines and expectations and whether or not you anticipate there being a is there a bounce built into your expectation in the second half thanks john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah we do ken expect events to pick up in the second half of the year its still i would say indiscernible but the second quarter will probably look a lot like the first is our guess a good bit of our business is built around real estate capital markets and our real estate customers and that business has just been really really slow and if you look at the component parts of our business generally speaking whether its syndications revenue revenue generated from fixed income placement or derivative sales its been pretty good over the course of the first quarter but the real estate capital markets have been very soft ma was pretty good in the first quarter we expect that to be true through the balance of the year so i think were guiding to pick up in the second half of the year and we believe thats very possible david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and just for clarification to make sure ken that when john said you should expect the second quarter to look like the first quarter thats ex cvadva john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah yeah sorry david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp so were talking about the lower end of probably in the middle of the million to million range is about where we would expect that and we dont expect to have a cvadva adjustment quite as volatile as you just saw this quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc appreciate that yeah and second question just on the loans side as far as the outlook goes when you think about just the combination of either your supply of credit and the demand of credit and this changing environment that were in just whats happening on the lending side of things in terms of how the environment is changing that are you guys tightening up at all is it more about the end client thats changing their demand functions john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah well naturally in a softening economy if you will we are going to probably be a little more conservative even though i would say that we like as i said a few minutes ago we like to think that our underwriting standards dont change from economic period to economic period we are in some very good markets as david pointed out and while pipelines are softer we see people that are still have opportunities we want to be smart about client selectivity all the time probably even more so during periods like this we want to support our existing customers and some almost in round numbers of loan growth weve experienced in the last quarter was to existing customers so we are acquiring some new customers but being very thoughtful about that and then separately while our economies are good and we do see some opportunity pipelines are down because of i think customer caution related to still difficulty acquiring labor there are two open jobs in the southeast for every one person looking for a job so labor market is still tight and cost while moderating have risen fairly significantly including interest cost obviously which puts pressure on projects so i think for the balance of the year well probably see pipelines will have moderated and stayed fairly muted but we believe we can deliver the loan growth that were projecting despite that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator our next question comes from line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc in the past youve talked a little bit about the fact that youre not going to need debt financing for i dont know several quarters and i just wanted to see if you could give us an update on how youre thinking about that regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 especially as you even though your size doesnt come into the current tlac expectations there is the potential for that to happen over time and wanted to hear how youre thinking about that thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so from a debt financing standpoint we borrowed a little bit from the fhlb as you saw but the larger term financing we said wed push out probably till the second half of the year we dont know what the regime is going to be if there will be any change pushed down to us from a tlac standpoint at some point whether we have that or not we need some more term financing some term debt that well put on and so i think that we can make sure we deal with that over time betsy i would say that the changes that are at least being batted around right now you cant move too fast because we all cant go out there and raise a bunch of debt at the same time itd be tough for the market to absorb so i think any change that might be coming relative to that would be over time and i still think there is going to be some tailoring what that looks like what that means well have to find out see what our regulatory supervisors and policymakers decide but outside of something like that we have a little bit of term debt that we need to get done and thats really pointed towards the back half of this year and that said are included in our guidance betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and that was something that you had been talking about for a while just wondering if its feasible to give us a sense as to size if thats reasonable or not david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp no we havent done that yet so were still working out what that needs to look like and precise timing too but we dont expect it this first half of the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then separately could you just give us a sense on the expense outlook that youve got for the kinds of levers that you have to keep the expense guide in the range that youve got to and if there is anything in particular that you could point us to in terms of opportunities for efficiency improvement from here thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah its a great question we try to not try we gave guidance that our first quarter was going to be a high watermark im not sure that made it into everybodys expectations but it is what it is were now giving you guidance again that we think the first half of the year will be higher than the second half of the year we had some things that we knew were coming in the first half including we moved our merit month our merit increase up a month from april to march so youve seen that in our first quarter and in any event i think when you look at the way to work on expenses the first thing are salaries and benefits and making sure that youve got the right people right number of the right people doing the right things and i think regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 thats always a challenge and we continue to look at process improvement leveraging technology so that when we have attrition natural attrition perhaps we dont have to backfill those people if we can move that at the same time weve looked at our occupancy i do think return to work is still trying to find its way but we likely to have more square footage than we need whether it be in the branch base or the office space and so we have a team constantly working on square footage which is our second highest cost from a technology standpoint were having to make room to go through our transformation were working on right now and so those costs are going up and were able to have cuts in other places to pay for it vendor spend is another area where we really make sure that we limit our use of consultants or contracts with vendors we just make sure we get the best deal we can and we have a team working on that so there is a cost pool in this company thats not going to go through some type of challenge during this year because you dont have a tailwind in from rates so youve got to do start working on your expenses today to help and were doing that and so we have pretty good confidence in our expense number that to right now for this year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator thank you our final question comes from the line of stephen scouten with piper sandler please proceed with your question stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah good morning thanks i just wanted to ask a little bit about the adjusted revenue guidance obviously i can appreciate that would be down a little bit given the funding pressures industrywide but as i look at your results from this quarter it kind of feels like they were within guidance from last quarter and the nim was exceptionally high so it just feels like you might be ahead of schedule versus having to pare that guidance back so i wonder if you can walk me through the main drivers of that reduction david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well there are two primary drivers the first is we used in our guidance the march forward curve that had basis points worth of cuts in the year with one increase so youre down into the million range by the end of the year so we then try to sensitize that and we told you if that wasnt quite there how much that may mean and you can see that on page of the deck so that was number one number two we just had our capital markets was down quite a bit in the first quarter primarily driven by a portion of it driven by the cvadva adjustment we dont think that will repeat at that level but nonetheless its in the number and so youre already down that so we didnt carve that out as an adjusted item thats in our core number some people adjust and some people dont what we do is provide that and let you do what you want with it but when were giving you guidance its in our number in our core number regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 21apr2023 and so those are the two big drivers weve already given you guidance that our service charge number is likely to go down because were going to offer up 24hour grace and were not exactly sure what thatll mean but weve taken an estimate and weve given you the million for service charges and well update as we learn but those are probably the big three stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay very helpful david and then i guess just one maybe highlevel kind of question i mean it feels like your business model has really proven itself out right now youre in just a phenomenal position from a deposit perspective and youve diversified your loan book so much over the last few years i guess as you look at the environment today is there anything you would have done differently or anything you would have structured differently knowing what i guess weve learned since march or what have you or do you feel like youve done what you would have wanted to do regardless david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp stephen i think weve we really are our core of our franchise are our customers and the people that work here and we have a fabulous customer base deposit base weve said that for many many years even when rates were zero virtually zero and you didnt see the benefit of that rising rates and of course having a liquidity challenges all proved the business model out so we certainly wouldnt change that and we wouldnt change our focus on thinking of our customer on the right side of the balance sheet in the form of a checking account or an operating account thats really worked well for us weve brought on some really talented people in our company in particular our technology area we brought on some very good people in the revenue areas that are doing a great job for us and so i just think in sticking to fundamentals of banking is what weve done its what johns asked us to do were not trying to take big bets on anything were just trying to keep it down the fairway and to me steady as she goes has been the way and may not be flashy but it seems to be paying off for us and i think it would just stay on that soundness profitability and growth those are the three words john asked us to use in that order and if we stick to that were going to have a pretty good franchise its going to be less volatile than many of our peers and certainly less volatile than we used to be precrisis so i dont see a lot of change we need to get better and leverage technology in some areas where were using human capital and thats just thats on the todo list and were trying to get after it stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co fantastic thanks so much i appreciate it john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you well i know its been a busy week for everybody i appreciate your participation today and thank you for your interest in regions well end the call thanks very much regions financial corp rf corrected
