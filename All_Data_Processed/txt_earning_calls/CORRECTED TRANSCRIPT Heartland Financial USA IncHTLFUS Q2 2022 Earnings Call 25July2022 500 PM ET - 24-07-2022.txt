executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks and good afternoon as bruce outlined this was another solid quarter for htlf with earnings per share of loan growth of million excluding ppp strong revenue growth improved expense levels and continued favorable credit trends included in this quarters results were the following large items gain on sale of two illinois branches was million gain on sale of a small insurance sub was and a gain on the sale of our visa b shares was million against these gains were losses on the sales securities of million and charter consolidation restructuring costs of million altogether these items increased pretax income by just under million and increased earnings per share by about i will cover these in more detail throughout my heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 comments i would also remind everyone that both our earnings release and second quarter investor presentation are included in the ir section of htlfs website so ill start my comments as i usually do with the provision for credit losses which totaled million and was unchanged from last quarter this quarter the provisioning for loan growth was partially offset by favorable underlying credit trends more specifically nonperforming loans were down slightly compared to last quarter and loan delinquencies remained historically low at basis points of total loans and net chargeoffs were minimal at this quarter at quarter end the allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments increased million to million or of total loans in addition at quarter end unamortized purchased loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled million or basis points of loans moving to other balance sheet items investment balances rose just over million to end the quarter at billion representing of assets with a tax equivalent yield of in modified duration between five and six years and producing monthly cash flows of million to million during the quarter we took the opportunity to reposition some of the portfolio by selling just over million of securities that yielded and used the proceeds to repurchase new securities yielding the loss on the repositioning was largely offset by the million gain we realized on the sale of our remaining visa b shares the tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to at quarter end and reflects basis points decline due to the decrease in market value of investments and some balance sheet growth that was partially offset by a basis points increase from higher retained earnings htlfs regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier at just under and total riskbased at so the balance sheet continues to be very strong and wellpositioned moving to the income statement starting with revenue net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million higher than the prior quarter the main drivers of the increase were strong loan and deposit growth together with the impact of the feds shortterm interest rate increases and a low level of deposit price increases this quarter also included million decline in ppp interest and fees to million from million last quarter we exited the quarter with just under of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis rose basis points this quarter to due to the recent rate increases investment yields improved basis points and loan yields excluding ppp were basis points higher while interest cost also rose basis points this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which is up basis points from the prior quarter noninterest income was flat compared to the prior quarter at million however excluding gains and losses core net noninterest income was million up almost million and exceeded our projections the main components were first a strong increase in deposit service fees of million that does include our usual annual visa incentives of million and other noninterest income was up million due to a million increase in commercial swaps and syndication fees and the previously mentioned million gain on the sale of our remaining visa b shares these positives were offset somewhat by weaker wealth management fees and mortgage banking revenue due to rising interest rates so core revenue trends were positive for both net interest income and fees and we believe revenue can continue to trend positive through the rest of heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 shifting to expenses noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter thats down million from last quarter excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses our core expenses decreased million to million compared to million last quarter and came in a little better than projected almost all expense categories were flat to down this quarter with the most significant improvement coming in salary and benefits expense which decreased million due primarily to a decline in fte count of for the quarter as a result of the strong revenue growth and core expense reductions this quarter the second quarter efficiency ratio improved significantly to while looking ahead we believe second quarter results provide significant momentum that will continue into the back half of this is highlighted by first loan pipelines which as bruce mentioned remain strong and support our expected loan growth rate of to per quarter nontime deposit growth is expected to slow into the range per quarter assuming no additional fed changes net interest income is projected to grow in the midsingle digits on a percentage basis next quarter reflecting continued loan growth and a full quarter impact from the june fed rate increase with some offset from some lagging pressure on deposit pricing the expected fed increase of basis points in july is projected to increase net interest income by million to million on an annualized basis assuming our normal deposit ratio of about ph million provisions for credit losses should remain near current levels given the projected loan growth and assuming net chargeoffs remain below historic levels for the rest of however changes in economic projections could have a significant impact on future provisions should a stronger recession began to materialize core noninterest income excluding gains and losses is expected to normalize into the range of million to million per quarter with higher commercial deposit swap and syndication fees helping to offset lower mortgage banking and wealth revenue as rates continue to rise core expenses are expected to decline slightly into the million to million range over the next two quarters however inflationary pressures particularly wage inflation remain challenging ph other consolidation restructuring costs are expected to be in the million to million range next quarter and in total we estimate million to million of remaining costs over the next two years consolidation benefits have already begun to layer in and will continue to do so over the next two years we remain very confident that in total they will reach million on an annualized basis when the consolidations are completed in late and finally we believe a tax rate of to excluding new tax credits is a reasonable run rate and with that i will turn the call back over to bruce for some questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc latif we can open up the line now for questions heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a qa a questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of damon delmonte of kbw damon delmonte please go ahead damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybodys doing well today bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc we are thank you david damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just want to great great just want to start off with loan growth really solid quarter this quarter and the commentary implies that youre remaining on track and you have another good visibility to the pipeline and things look good could you just talk a little bit about what areas of the footprint are providing these opportunities and kind of just what some of the expectations are for the drivers of the growth over the back half of the year please bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah damon we really had solid growth across our entire footprint for the first time since i can remember maybe since ive been here at htlf all of our banks had organic growth we did have sort of outstanding growth in colorado in arizona and in california and a fair amount of that california growth was attributed to the agribusiness group but really everybody was had very very solid growth our focus has been ci activity and thats why you saw that be the most significant segment as you know the audio gap group is doing well as is real estate and i also do want to point out our consumer group just had a really outstanding quarter as well with their growth so were really pleased that its occurring throughout our footprint and in all loan categories and maybe the most important thing the credit quality of our new originations were very very pleased with and that the originations are in we have flipped from flipped to more of a floating rate mix damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then bryan as it relates to the margin the commentary kind of points towards a continued rise in the margin you think you could kind of replicate the amount of core expansion you saw this quarter or do you think that the cost of deposits kind of catches up a little bit with another 75basis point rate hike and could kind of way weigh in a little bit on the pace of expansion bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 yeah i think it could a little bit i think if i went back and looked what i would have said last quarter for a 75basis point rate increase it would have been a higher number than the million to million i said in my comments and thats because we are expecting the betas to be more normal however were going to try and do our best to keep those deposits within where the market is but well see it really is going to depend on what the market does but there could be a little bit of lag too i think i mentioned we had really good that june looked really solid with the first basis points coming in we only got a few really a few weeks of that increase and some of our loan growth came towards the end of the quarter so those couple i really feel good that we can raise the core or raise the net interest income line by that midsingle digits over what we posted this year or this quarter bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah damon maybe just to add to bryans comments our margin expanded in june more than it did for the average for the quarter so that gives us some momentum and then also we ended the period the quarter end period about million more in loans than the average during the quarter so just those two things alone give us a very positive feeling about expanding our margin in addition to the three quarters rate hikes that everybodys anticipating but as bryan said for the first time of all these hikes we really think were going to get into our deposit betas weve done a great job of really holding our deposit rates down over these first couple of audio gap damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay great and then just final question on the regards the capital and the tce ratio down to i know a good portion of that is attributable to the aoci impact and stuff but does that have any does that provide any concern for you guys as far as the pace of growth youre seeing with loans that maybe you need to slow down a little bit because of that level getting into the mid or do you feel like its really a temporary item and its not really going to be a constraining factor for you bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i dont think its going to be a constraining factor on our loan growth it may certainly well look at the investment portfolio and how we reinvest the cash flows and well see what deposit dollars flow in as well i think if we could wed probably manage to a flat to slightly up earning assets not hyper growth in the earning assets partially because of the keeping the tce under control but were not going to hold back on loan growth because of this this wont slow us down damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats the one i had ill step back oh bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and i would just add heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc just to finish that off we do have plenty of regulatory damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc capital and i was told i may have misspoke but our total riskbased capital is so damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay perfect thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from andrew liesch of piper sandler andrew liesch your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi guys good afternoon thanks for taking the questions i know some of the focus lately has been on larger loans and im just curious if thats kind of what drove the loan syndication fees to the level they were at now and i guess then similarly like what was the average size of the loans that were added to the portfolio this quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think the average still was relatively in that millionish ph style ill look this up but off the top of my head i think it was around million give or take which is slightly probably higher than our average bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thats about double historically our average andrew but youve got to balance off some of those larger loans and the syndicated transactions with a really strong quarter in small business and business banking loans as well were really focusing on all of them not just one area at the expense of another andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful so i mean i guess so whats your outlook for the syndication fees i guess whats the pipeline for the larger loans then heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah we feel pretty good about the third quarter with what we already have either closed or whats in our pipeline but the other area that we feel real good about the capital markets is on our interest rate swaps so between those two we feel that we can probably replicate maybe even another million or so in the third quarter above where we were in the second quarter but as bryan said thats really offsetting some wealth fees as well as some mortgage fees andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you youve covered all the other questions i had in your prepared comments so ill step back thanks bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks andrew operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hey jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi so yeah just wanted to kind of get a sense for the process of the citywide conversion what do you think the customer employee sort of reaction if any but just i think being the first one kind of as you got through that process any takeaways from how it shapes how you do successive conversions to come i think you said you got four left this year bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so jeff let me take a crack at this first and then ill let bryan follow so first of all weve done a lot of ma over the years i mean weve always felt that doing ma is kind of a core competency thats really what were doing here except were using all the same systems so what were doing here is really going from different instances into were going into one aba routing number which in citywides situation their routing number didnt change because thats the routing number that were using for htlf bank overall we have about duplicate accounts which means customers are going to need a new account theres a complete process in place to go through that it includes the bank leadership and that was really the first experience at citywide and it went very very well heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 the thing that weve learned over the years jeff is you just have to communicate communicate and then communicate more with both our customers and our employees but what i would tell you is that the citywide customers are very excited once we complete this project that they can utilize our branches in california and our branches in arizona as they travel or vacation or winter so they are very very happy about the expanded access to our branch network bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah and i would just add jeff i think behind the scenes from what i can see what i hear at least from my folks in finance and some of the operations folks is we got through pretty well you always expect a couple bumps and i think there probably were a couple bumps but they were minor and they were very the type that we believe are going to be something we can cover in future ones all that being said as bruce said this first one is a little bit easier right its the same charter and you know all of that the next couple are the ones we really have our eyes on we feel good about it lots of planning going on but i think the part that bruce said about the customer communication and how we handled the duplicate accounts if we can continue to have that work the way it did in citywide that will be a big positive because thats usually the biggest customer impact and we handled it well in this one if we can keep handling those well i think were going to have continued success here which we expect to and were planning to jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co right thanks switching gears a little bit just wanted to see if there was any update on kind of the may fraud events if there was any progress on recovery or any movement within that group of those two instances of any update on that front bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan you want to take that one nathan r jones a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah absolutely bruce well they were really we do look at them as onetime events and we have continued we took a conservative stance and quickly addressed them with the chargeoffs but we do continue to work on them ph from longerterm resolutions and have several positive things that have occurred that we are working very hard at along the lines of ph establishing additional collateral and then also working with one of the customers to work their way out of it through the general business operations so we do feel good about that just nothing at this point we can start to book any offsets at this point bruce or bryan anything youd like to add on top of that im sorry jeff go ahead jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co no i didnt want to cut anyone off but as a followon nathan just wanted to kind of get a sense that through those situations was there any procedural or structural changes that youve made or kind of you said theyre one offs but did it kind of lead to any changes or revisiting any practices from that end heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc it has we have we always use anything that occurs as to really sharpen our pencils and make sure that were as clean as we can be from a credit perspective so in both instances weve used it as a learning opportunity to really improve our overall processes and hopefully help protect us from any future issues that are similar in nature but we were able to use that as an opportunity to learn and grow from it and implement some enhancements jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co maybe one last one if i could just real quick on the fee income run rate i think bryan mentioned million to million that so that will exclude any securities gains or losses is that correct youd kind of treat that as a zero bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah it does i kind of took that with the million let me just find my number here so i can tell you how i thought about that yeah when you get to the core and then you back out the visa b gain so the core i was talking about was million which excludes all gains and losses but that visa b gain was sitting in other noninterest income which is a category i dont back out so if you back that out it gets you to million this quarter and if you take another million out because of the visa b share while thats recurring every year it doesnt recur every quarter so if you took that out youre in about the million range and as bruce said we expect that the syndication fees can offset the downdraft we might see in wealth management and whatever so thats how i came to kind of million jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc bryan thanks for all the all your thoughts on the financial outlook ive kind of run through my list there the one thing that caught my eye this cycle was the specialized industries it wasnt in the last quarter presentation so im just wondering how you manage the credit risk in some of those businesses and some over the last call it three heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 to five years have triggered some losses really across the industry the franchise finance and healthcare in particular so i guess maybe talk about the growth and more importantly how its kind of smart growth for your shareholders bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah terry im going to ill take that first and then ill let nathan follow up so these are first of all from our perspective its more kind of the middle market or lower end of the middle market its a specialized group that we brought in who this is what theyve historically done and they play what i would call above where weve historically played at the bank level and so we brought in people that do that are specialized in these various areas and more importantly we also brought in corresponding talent on the credit side to match it up so we didnt just take our existing staff and say we want to go after this market we brought in people and we grew the area very specific just like the agribusiness that we acquired where we acquired the staff out in california we acquired both on the origination side the underwriting side and the credit side we feel that if youre going to go into a new area you need the new expertise across the board also these larger type of customers are buying more of our fee services whether its in treasury audio gap whether its retirement plan services interest rate swaps the ability to do syndications so theyre really audio gap our corporate card business which was up pretty dramatically on a yearoveryear basis so we feel that that is the a segment of indiscernible grow wed love about a third of our business to come from sort of traditional bank activity about a third from the specialized group and about a third from the agribusiness group until that group builds its portfolio and then that would slow down nathan do you want to maybe address how you supported it on the credit side with additional analytics and talent nathan r jones a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah absolutely bruce and as bruce has kind of noted we do have a dedicated credit team within our organization thats really dedicated against our hsi or our specialized industries group and they are some of our strongest talent and most experienced but even on that weve really gone through and done very very exacting and detailed work to make sure that we have really strong supporting guidance and then providing the necessary support and analytics to make sure from what we feel is really top quartile so were really not leaning in hard from a credit perspective but more making sure were getting that top quartile so were not taking significant credit risk there and then what were taking we have a pretty significant analytics to supporting behind it along with a strong strong credit team thats able to evaluate and make sure that we understand the risk we are taking bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and the other thing i would terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 25jul2022 thank you both for that yeah bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah terry the other thing id mention is the risk rating of that portfolio and those originations the quality of the credit is better than the rest of our portfolio and thats really part of the strategy we wanted to go out market a little bit in part of our originations not ignoring anything else that we do we want to do really do it all but the credit quality is the key along with the dedicated credit staff that nathan described terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then bruce a followup where do you need to be in the charter consolidation before you seriously look at any ma opportunities i know ma is in the companys dna but also once the conversion is complete as you talk about theres just increased capacity to really drive that future growth bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i mean the reality is with where with the uncertainty in the economy right now i think any ma is really a 2023type scenario however what i would say is that the way that we have built the charter consolidation is that any strategic ma that we would have that would be on the bank side not a fee business of some sort we could stop the charter consolidation and work on the ma and then go back to the charter consolidation so i mean the reality is were going to be halfway through it by the start of and if an opportunity came up we would be ready to do it in an ma transaction terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right thanks again have a nice night bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you ph terry operator thank you as there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mr lee for closing comments bruce k
