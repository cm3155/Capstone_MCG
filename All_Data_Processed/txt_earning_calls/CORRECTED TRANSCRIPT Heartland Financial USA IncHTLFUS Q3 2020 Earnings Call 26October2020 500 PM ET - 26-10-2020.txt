under our pandemic management plan protecting our employees and customers while effectively running our business employees who can work from home do so while those who come into bank locations and offices run rotating teams to limit exposure heartlands diverse geographic footprint continues to be a strength during the pandemic only two of our banking centers are closed and we are operating in communities were serving customers in lobbies drivethrus or both as well as digitally weve demonstrated our flexibility closing and reopening bank lobbies as appropriate of our banking centers are fully open and operating as normal currently operate drivethru only or with restricted lobby access well continue to adapt to local conditions and are comfortable and confident in our ability to operate in this environment for the foreseeable future consumer behavior has changed as a result of the pandemic digital transactions continue to increase and branch transactions have decreased approximately yeartodate given this ongoing consumer shift to digital we continue to rationalize our branch footprint in the third quarter we approved six branch consolidations and an additional of branches are under review turning to deposits we delivered another strong quarter of deposit growth total deposits ended the quarter at billion and nontime deposits totaled billion increasing million or during the quarter of our banks delivered nontime deposit growth led by dubuque bank and trust with a increase and rocky mountain bank with a increase our deposit mix remains enviable with in noninterestbearing accounts and in nontime account balances weve also been diligent in executing our deposit pricing strategy and have reduced total deposit costs just basis points for the quarter down from basis points in the second quarter and basis points from the third quarter of last year heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 turning to loans our total commercial lending portfolio decreased slightly by or million from the linked quarter in our remaining portfolio agriculture decreased million from the linked quarter residential mortgage decreased million and consumer loans decreased million earlier this month the sba began to process ppp forgiveness applications to date of our borrowers have submitted forgiveness applications representing million of our billion in ppp loans on october the sba released a simplified forgiveness application for ppp loans under approximately of our client borrowers with balances representing less than of our ppp loan portfolio are eligible many ppp borrowers are still waiting to begin the forgiveness process in anticipation of additional rule changes and clarification of tax implications turning to key credit metrics our nonperforming loans decreased basis points from the end of the second quarter representing basis points of total loans at the end of the third quarter as a percentage of total assets nonperforming assets declined basis points from basis points to basis points over the same period other real estate also decreased to million at the end of the third quarter from million at the end of the second quarter the delinquency ratio continues to improve decreasing to basis points from basis points over the prior period due to the pandemic we anticipated a downward shift in risk ratings this has started but not to the extent expected nonpass rated loans increased from in the second quarter to in the third quarter the ratio remains at a relatively low level substandard loans comprised of total nonpass loans compared to in the previous quarter lastly net loan chargeoffs for the third quarter were reported at million or basis points compared to million or basis points in the second quarter this increase was driven by two commercial credits first a previously identified and reserved for chargeoff of million on a fracking sand company that operates in an industry thats been negatively impacted by the pandemic we do not have additional exposure to the fracking sand industry the second large chargeoff was a newly identified million loan in the wholesale wine industry in california excluding chargeoffs from these two large commercial borrowers chargeoffs would have remained close to flat from last quarter and we are encouraged with the overall improvement in our credit metrics during the pandemic as of september of the approximately billion of loans modified under covid relief programs million have returned to original payment terms and million remain in their original deferral status and only million or of total loans have received additional or second modifications of these second modifications are principal and interest deferments for days the remainder are primarily interestonly payments for days more information about heartlands loan exposure to customer segments we believe are more heavily impacted by covid19 is available in the table on page of our news release the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on heartlands financial performance will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic related restrictions on business and consumer activity and the availability of government programs to alleviate economic stress turning to strategic investments were investing for growth and to enrich the customer experience through our companywide initiative operation customer compass all while achieving an alltime low efficiency ratio we completed the upgrade of our atm network installing more than new atms across our footprint the new atms are state of the art and offer significantly more convenience and fraud protection new features such as image deposits will benefit our small business customers allowing them to

via video we will evaluate expanding the pilot program across our footprint based on customer feedback and acceptance we know more customers are preferring to bank virtually and were committed to transforming the banking experience taking a customer first innovationoriented approach we reached another significant milestone in september with the final transition onto the bestinclass salesforce crm and ncino loan origination platforms these tools enable commercial teams at each of our banks to better serve and meet the needs of our clients while supporting business development efforts were achieving our goal of delivering efficiency speed and an improved internal and external customer experience evidenced by a decrease in the time from loan application to funding weve introduced

our improved edeposit product a software solution that remotely captures and manages deposits giving clients greater security and compatibility from almost any device we launched integrated payable

communities where we live and work i will now turn the call over to bryan mckeag heartlands chief financial officer for more details on our record performance and financials bryan bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today by referencing the press release which shows reported earnings per share of this quarter this includes provisions for credit for losses of million an acquisition and integration costs of million excluding these items heartlands aftertax pre provision acquisition and integration costs earnings per share was heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 i would also point you to our updated third quarter investor presentation which is in the ir site on our website again this quarter core earnings and results were solid with financial trends and metrics also positive in almost all aspects as i mentioned the total provision for credit losses this quarter was million driven by a million provision on a ph new problem credit that was identified and fully charged off during the quarter and a million increase in subrated loans these were largely offset by million decline in loan balances and an million decline in unfunded commitments the updated consensus economic forecasts showed improvement however the economic outlook factors and components we use to develop the allowance will not change reflecting heartlands assessment that a significant level of economic uncertainty remains net chargeoffs this quarter totaled million with million attributed to loans that had already been fully reserved in the second quarter of and then the new million chargeoff of the previously mentioned loan in total the million quarterly provision plus the million in net chargeoffs resulted in a decrease in the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses of million at the end of the quarter allowance for credit losses on loans was million or of total loans and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was million or basis points of total loans together these two allowances result in the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses of million or of total loans when ppp loans are excluded the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses increases basis points to of loans moving on to the rest of the balance sheet total assets grew million ending the quarter at just over billion with a loan to deposit ratio of the tangible common equity ratio increased basis points to from last quarter as increases from retained earnings and the fair value marks on bond portfolio were partially offset by the impact of a million increase in assets heartlands regulatory ratios also remained strong with the common equity tier ratio at and the total risk based capital ratio at investments grew million this quarter as we invested some of our excess liquidity and preinvested some of the expected cash flow from the ppp forgiveness investments now comprise of assets with a tax equivalent yield of with duration of just under six years and generate approximately million of cash flow on a monthly basis borrowings increased million due to the preinvesting strategy and totaled million or of assets at quarter end at september our banking network had approximately billion of unused borrowing commitment capacity so heartlands balance sheet continues to be very strong with solid capital base healthy loss reserves ample liquidity and low leverage moving on to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter or million lower than the prior quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was or basis points lower than last quarter reflecting declines in loan and investment yields of basis points and basis points respectively that were slightly offset by a basis point drop in the cost interest cost on borrowings and deposits compared to last quarter this quarter the net interest margin improved basis points of purchase accounting accretion compared to basis points in the prior quarter noninterest income totaled million for the quarter up from last quarter as the gain on sales loans was up million on higher mortgage loan activity while total security gains ph decreased million compared to last quarter in addition service charges loan servicing fees and trust fees were all higher this quarter moving to noninterest expense noninterest expenses remained wellmanaged totaling million this quarter were flat compared to last quarter core run rate costs which excludes acquisition integration and restructuring costs also excludes tax credit costs and asset gains or losses decreased million million heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 compared to million last quarter more specifically salary and benefits were up slightly at approximately million and occupancy furniture and equipment costs combined totaled million down slightly this quarter these categories account for twothirds of our core costs and theyve been at this level for the past quarters in addition our ftes of also remained relatively flat this quarter and over the last quarters has declined by million or from a peak of fte in quarter two during that same time period assets have increased billion or these results demonstrate the leverage and increased productivity we have achieved as we work to restructure the company trim our branch network and implement the many customer compass productivity improvements weve identified over the past two and a half years all while continuing the companys significant growth one other expense item i would mention is losses and writedowns on the assets which totaled million this quarter and included million of writedown on branches as part of heartlands ongoing branch optimization program as this program continues to progress we expect additional branch writedowns to occur over the next one or two quarters so going forward excluding new acquisitions we would expect the following trends to continue over the next one or two quarters including muted loan growth excluding ppp and modest deposit growth ppp forgiveness timing remains uncertain but its likely to be slower than we have been estimating with more of the forgiveness moving into the net interest margin remained under pressure however declines should be much less than we saw in the third quarter and mortgage activity will seasonally decline but will be higher than it has been in prior years during the same period core expenses should remain stable at the million to million range with regard to the closing of our two upcoming ma transactions that are both scheduled to close in early december on a high level and on a combined basis these transactions will add billion to billion in loans and billion to billion in deposits and approximately million in goodwill and million in deposit intangibles and should provide an approximate to lift to our core eps after cost saves are realized and after adding almost million of additional shares for the aimbank transaction and lastly ma and conversionrelated costs of million to million should be a should come in the next two quarters with million next quarter and the remaining in q1 of in the interest of time i would also direct you to my comments from last quarter for additional details on these transactions and with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc very good thank you very much well now open up the phone lines for your questions heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co thanks good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc good afternoon jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co a question on the net chargeoffs you detailed what million in the two loans the remaining call it million where in those in categories that also covid at risk or that youd peg as any more detail on the remaining bucket even though it was just smaller balances just any detail on that bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah this is bruce and ill let nathan also chime in but i would say theres nothing in the remaining balances after you get past those two large chargeoffs that would i guess lead us in any direction of sort of normal activity for our portfolio side nathan any other comment there nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc no bruce you said it well its supposedly across the usual suspects youd see it diverse across numerous credits everything from development to indiscernible  jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay and the commentary about expected to remain elevated bruce i think youve mentioned that absent the two the ph fracking and kind of wholesale line credits you would have chargeoffs similar to the prior quarters just trying to gauge that elevated comment is it are we in the basis points to basis points or are we somewhere north of that just trying to gauge and what is maybe driving that elevated indiscernible i guess heading into as modification sort of roll off here lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 yeah ill jump in and then nathan you can add but i think youre picking the comment up from our earnings release and i think it just reflects the fact that theres uncertainty going forward knock on knocking on wood here as we went through this quarter we really took the charges that we saw there and there was i dont think any really big ones coming down the ph pike that we knew of at that point but things change fast i mean the million charge that we did take this quarter showed up quick and had to be dealt with so in this environment i think were always concerned that could we could get a surprise but i think were in pretty good shape nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah i think the other comment i might make is that while were very pleased with the credit metrics both the npa numbers the delinquency numbers are less than of our loan portfolio remaining with some sort of deferral we are seeing elevated increases in our nonpass credits theres a lot of uncertainty around covid there are spikes happening in about half of the states that we operate in so theres been sort of a little bit of a pullback from recent reopenings and theres a tremendous amount of uncertainty around a government stimulus program so i think were just trying to be cautious with that statement more than anything specific thats showing up in our numbers jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co got it okay that addressed that pretty well thanks maybe one last one just on the loan runoff and we got bryan get your comments on expectations for muted loan growth but in terms of absolute runoff in a quarter and what may continue to be a headwind is that im going to guess its a combination but is that lower demand andor youre sort of tightening credit appetite im just trying to get a sense for what is the force maybe which is greater your hesitation on new loans or demand is drying up bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so its a couple of things lets first take the residential mortgage portfolio and consumer that really is as you know other than in texas we pretty much exited the residential mortgage business we did have a portfolio with rates remaining very very low those loans are being refinanced away from us we generally are able to maintain the deposit relationship but the loan itself is being ph refied out as home values have been have continued to be steady or increasing so thats the story there the consumer book is a little bit the same way most of our consumer loans are home equity loans which in this low rate environment if people have balances their and home values continue to appreciate their refiing those balances into a longer term 15year fixed rate low interest rate mortgages so as long as rates continue to be low we would expect to see some runoff for those reasons and those portfolios were actually feeling fairly confident in our commercial book and the new activity with our renewed focus on ci operating companies where were seeing a decrease there is we are seeing our construction portfolio pay off as we anticipated many of the loans that we funded during the construction phase are going into the secondary market and there is some of the investment real estate that weve had on our books is being refinanced out not necessarily for credit reasons wed like to keep them but more for pricing reasons a lot of the community banks smaller community banks are taking those million million million investment real estate deals booking those in the mid million and we just dont think thats a good tradeoff and so there is some of that refinancing away from us happening heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay i appreciate the indiscernible jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andrew liesch with piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi good afternoon everyone bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi bryan i appreciate your comments on the margin but just curious kind of with this strategy youve taken on kind of prefunding some securities with expected payoffs of ppp like where do you think the margin sort of flattens out and how much pressure do you think remains in the coming quarters bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah obviously ive got to indiscernible with a lot of ifs because the andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co of course yeah bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc indiscernible things going on i think we probably have another basis points to maybe basis points of the dropping just given the mix change that weve seen with investments being a higher percentage that wasnt there for the whole quarter so theres probably a little bit of that i mean the ppp forgiveness well see what the timing is of that that could change things just a little bit but how much excess liquidity then shows up again this quarter with deposits and how much will loans grow certainly loan growth would help a lot we can get that to even switch out the cash flow from the investments into the loan portfolio would be great so i think before johnson and aim come in i would say youve probably got another basis points or maybe basis points if things get a lot of liquidity and everything but the size of the balance sheet is bigger so i would say heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 andrew even though you might see a margin go down i think net interest income is going to remain relatively flat to where it was this quarter so i think we can hold on there now johnson is going to come in and aim both have excess liquidity the good news is aims portfolio has a theyve been having the net interest margin thats north of and in fact almost so that will help the margin when that comes in even though well get some excess liquidity so there is really a lot of moving parts andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc indiscernible how we bring in those fees that could also cloud what the fourth quarter looks like andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co right right and then on the loans that have gotten a second deferral is there any sort of commonality among them and then i guess whats the tone out of there out of those borrowers and then eventually if they still need more deferrals after that whats the process of resolving some of these relationships if theyre still struggling at the time of that deferral payment ending bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan you want to take that one nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah the overwhelming majority is probably is being experienced by most other banks in industry as well is really located within the lodging portfolio really seeing the most indiscernible and needing the additional support of additional deferrals we are seeing some positive movement where were seeing capital gains as well as pretty significant austerity measures being put in place giving us some confidence in those customers we will have to continue to address them as we move forward but with so much still unknown at this point its really hard to give a determination of kind of where its going to resolve itself but we do feel good about those customers and where theyre at as of today bruce anything youd like to add to that bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc i think the only thing and this is getting a little in the weeds and maybe bryan want to jump in but if we have to continue to provide ongoing support then i think youre going to see us turn some of those loans into tdrs bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 and in fact we had a couple this quarter if you look at our tables in the back of the press release i think we had million indiscernible i had it on that table right in front of me i think there were million of additional tdrs and i believe if im not wrong here that those were a couple of lodging credits that did come up for their second renewal and based on the two and the credit we may end up being tdr so if that continues in the next that have yet to come through their deferral period and we do second there could be some additional tdrs bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc the other comment that i might make andrew is when this when the pandemic started we like almost all banks were fairly liberal in providing that first payment modification the second go round its a complete re underwriting and it goes through our complete process so weve had a lot of eyes on it as the second go round and if there is anything beyond that it probably will even be moved into our workout room bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc which we beefed up indiscernible bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc right andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you very much i appreciate that i will step back thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everyone bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi terry bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe first question on the branch optimization kind of the six branches what are your thoughts on the cost savings and maybe how much of that will be reinvested into like you said the atm upgrade and some other heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 investments you have on the tech side and then bruce you kind of said of branches are under review i guess i understand the meaning of that but out of those do you think a fair share of them will not pass through view and will be consolidated bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc let me take that question first terry and then bryan can talk about the cost save i think what were doing right now on those theres definitely probably half of those that we will either sell or consolidate i think the remaining its really how long do we want to give those because they might be in a growth market but we just over the last couple of years havent been able to grow our bank into them so its really not so its theyre in a good market but for whatever reason we havent been able to make them grow the way that we want to and we dont have another branch close or it doesnt make sense for us to sell that one bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and i think the question is in this environment going so digital will they continue to grow do you need that to grow among some of those markets as well so bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and we really want to part of our strategy as you know were much more commercially oriented with the small businessoriented and historically small businesses made decision based upon how close branches were we really want to give it a little more time than just three or four months during this pandemic to see whether that behavior changes bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and terry the other part of your question the six branches had a cost base kind of an annual base close to million people and the predominance is people and the real estate costs i think well probably get somewhere between and of that cost to go away well have to keep some of the people as we consolidate because well have a little bit more activity presumably going to the branch so thats yet to be figured out to see how that happens in this digital environment but i would estimate probably conservatively or so right in that ballpark we ought to be able to ph see about that for sure bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and terry as you know as we started to consolidate and prune our branch system a little over a year ago we have some pretty good historical numbers on when we consolidate branches weve been maintaining over of those deposits we modeled a much lower than that but weve been able to maintain right around terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great and then just as a followup question thanks for providing the nonpass rate that went from to im just curious that covid kind of sensitive portfolio i dont know if you have the details in front of you but what does the nonpass rated loans look like in say lodging or retail properties some of those that youve called out now for a couple of quarters how much higher are those specific portfolios than the portfolio average heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan you want to take that one nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah and i dont have it bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc keep asking nathan hes not in the room with us so nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc no problem yes thank you and while i dont have specific percentages as far as where they are individually for each one as far as their nonpass percentages again the larger the more impacted industries are the ones that are driving most of the decreases from a covid perspective with lodging being one of the largest ones of all ph so because you noted theyre the one experiencing struggle or struggling from an industry as well and its something well continue to monitor one of the things were doing proactively is were actually having monthly meetings where we go through and look at all the individual credits anything over of any size really over million and really ph going into an in depth both with their individual rms as well as senior management just to make sure were really understanding movement both pre going to nonpass and post just to make sure we understand where theyre at and how were taking all the necessary measures that we can terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc bruce anything that youd like to add to that bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc no i think it was fine bryan did you point him to the page bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc well and i was just going to say terry as youll recall weve always had kind of an outsized component relative to its portfolio size of ag loans that sit in the sub rated so i think thats continued to be one of the trends that drives that a little bit terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great thanks for pointing that out and thanks for everybodys help have a good night heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry bryan r mckeag a chief

a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc good damon damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good so first question just wanted to kind of circle back on the provision and kind of the outlook there but before that could you just explain a little bit why the reserve for the unfunded commitments was down to million this quarter is that just because of you had lower balances that youve released some of that reserve bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah its two things the loans coming down obviously that had some effect on the commitments we also as bruce mentioned had quite a few construction loans that moved out or that moved up into their permanent owneroccupied or cre category and those tend to have a little bit low once they move they have a little bit lower reserve we have a higher reserve rating rate on our construction loans and so that mix combination in the lower caused that to go down damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then as we try to think about the provision going forward just kind of given the commentary about potential for elevated net chargeoffs in the coming quarters and kind of ongoing economic uncertainties i mean its probably fair to assume were not going to see a provision as low as this quarter but do you think wed kind of go back somewhere closer to what we saw the first half of the year bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 i dont think its as high as the first half if you step back and assume that we dont get the million or so less on the investment or on the unfundeds we have close to million provision for the just the regular loans on the books i would suspect somewhere between there and million yeah million ph getting my decimal points right somewhere between that million and million is probably what were looking after the next couple quarters and then once you get past that and we do get to more normal times then its really just loan growth changes and hopefully not a lot of chargeoffs or changes in credit quality damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i think you said that the reserve or the acl i should say exppp loans was like this quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so thats the level youre comfortable with just kind of giving some of the weaknesses in across the footprint and just the rising spike of the virus bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc well i mean you never know right one of the things that i did is i looked back what was the worst year that we had during the great recession we never had a year of more than of loans for chargeoffs and it doesnt feel like were at this at as bad a spot right now so going in i think were in pretty good shape but obviously if we dont pull out of this if things continue to just trudge along and businesses cant keep going and there isnt enough stimulus then things could change thats part of the reason why what we didnt do damon was we probably if wed have just done the math on cecl with the forecasts coming looking a little bit better than they did last quarter we probably could have just taken more a smaller provision we dont think that was prudent given all the uncertainties we wanted to leave that those factors where they were which was on the high side just to make sure that we didnt get a false positive here and that this does get worse instead of really get better and that gives us more room to take some additional chargeoffs if that were to happen so and its kind of a longwinded answer but i really do think in the next quarter or two unless something changes that i dont see we should be i think somewhere in that million to million range damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then on the margin i may have missed this but can you kind of just walk me down the basis point quarteroverquarter decline i know you said ph you added liquidity but was that entirely liquidity was there a drag from ppp were there any other factors in there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think we had both and im just looking through ph a whole thing that i did another sheet paper so ppp loans the purchase accounting was the basis points again ppp loans was about basis points or it was basis points last quarter so it was about the same but that yield is so it does pull heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2020 down our net interest margin you have loans both the volume and rates were down in loans exppp and ex purchase accounting investments you have volume up but rates down and then ph there was left from the liabilities with rates down and volume up so combination of a lot of things i would say its mostly liquidity and the fact that we have had a shift towards a lower earning asset in the assets of that being investments ph from us damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay i guess that yeah that answered everything that i had so thank you very much appreciate it bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks damon operator thank you im
