reflecting the power of our technology enabled model the durability of our partnercentric value proposition and the early indications of a consumer resurgence with now more than a year of the covid19 pandemic moving into the rearview mirror i am proud of how our team has continued to execute on our strategic priorities our multiproduct multicapability strategy has enabled us to nimbly adapt and deliver bestinclass products and services to address our partners evolving needs while also generating appropriate riskadjusted returns for all our stakeholders lets get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter net earnings reached a record billion or per diluted share this reflected an increase of over last year as we marked the anniversary of the pandemics initial impact on our business and really the world we are deeply grateful for all of the frontline workers scientists and leaders have done to support our community and make progress toward an eventual return to normalcy purchase volume grew over last year reflecting a increase in purchase volume per account this increased spend was broadbased across our five business platforms this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions leading to a slight increase in loan receivables which were billion for the second quarter average balances per account were down about for the period while new accounts were up about net interest margin of was basis points higher than last year elevated payment rates and excess liquidity levels continue to have an impact on receivables and yield the efficiency ratio was for the quarter primarily reflecting lower net interest income expenses were down about compared to last year and down yeartodate as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned we remain on track to remove about million from our expense base by year end even as we continue to invest in our business credit continued to perform very well net chargeoffs were for the second quarter down almost basis points from last year turning to our balance sheet deposits were down billion or versus last year reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity position deposits represented of our funding mix at quarter end a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of some of our debt during the second quarter of during the quarter we returned million in capital through share repurchases of million and million in common stock dividends we also continue to reinvest in our business one of our greatest competitive synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 differentiators remains our digital capabilities we continue to invest in innovative products and services that enable our partners to meet their customers wherever and however they want to be met that where and how of course can change fairly quickly as can the objectives that our partners seek to achieve so we need to stay nimble and ahead of the curve we have continued to win and renew key partnerships including our recent renewal with tjx companies this has been a very valuable partnership for over years now and we are excited to continue to provide innovative financing products to tjx customers we also renewed other programs during the quarter including shop hq daniels and sutherlands and added four new programs including jcb and ochsner health our gotomarket strategy utilizes innovative and scalable ways to reach and serve customers effectively across a broad spectrum of industries and financing needs and over the course of their lifecycle we have built a technology platform that harnesses our proprietary data analytics cutting edge digital capabilities to offer a customized suite of products specifically designed with our partners and their customers in mind all while delivering appropriately aligned economic outcomes our recent business reorganization which included the creation of a growth organization and the redistribution of our partners from three sales platforms into five will allow us to better leverage these company resources and deliver swifter more optimized products and capabilities for our partners and sustainable profitable growth for our business in fact the growth we expect to achieve within each platform will be driven by utilizing our suite of products to expand lifetime value deploying more of our digital capabilities to expand customer reach or adapting our value propositions to harness organic trends as the landscape evolves in the case of our home and auto platform a combination of all three in particular our home partnerships have been a focus of synchronys going back to our business inception when we started providing financing for appliance purchases over the years weve significantly broadened the scope of this platform and expanded our customer reach today synchrony has penetrated across all distribution points in each sector of the home market from big retailers to independent merchants and contractors and oems and dealers our home platform provides financing solutions to about merchants and locations across a broad spectrum of industries including furniture and accessories mattresses and bedding appliances windows roofing hvac and flooring our partnerships are deeply rooted in industry expertise datadriven strategic objectives and mutually beneficial economic outcomes the average length of our top partners is over years because we are able to deliver a breadth of financing products innovative digital capabilities and seamless customer experiences that are customized to each partners needs as they evolve over time our data insights and analytics expertise when combined with the partners own data empowers each merchant as they seek to optimize their marketing customer acquisition and sales strategies and the value that our suite of products provides to their customers is clear about of our sales are repeat purchases whether customers are looking to upgrade their living room couch or suddenly find themselves in need of a new washing machine we enable our partners to consistently support those needs through a variety of financing options that are best suited to the customer and the particular purchase theyre considering so whether weve been entrusted to enhance customer loyalty drive transaction volume or ph usher a retailers adoption of digital assets our strategy has enabled steady growth across the home market for the four years prior to the pandemic synchronys home receivables grew at a cagr as consumer spend within home synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 improvement furniture and decor and electronic and appliances sectors each grew by between and annually certainly the pandemic has brought with it both challenges and opportunities as consumers quarantined in their homes the desire to renovate their homes or upgrade their furniture and decor intensified as people start to leave crowded metropolitan communities for suburban neighborhoods home improvement spend increased in alone the home industry represented an approximate billion market opportunity synchrony serves a fraction of that today even as we normalize toward a prepandemic cadence the consumers desire to invest in their living space is as strong as ever perhaps reflecting a secular shift in favor of more remote work we have positioned our home platform very well to capitalize on these trends we have opportunities to deepen the scope and reach of existing partnerships while also implementing a number of strategic initiatives to better leverage our core competencies and deepen our market penetration for example we have begun using more data and advanced analytics to enhance our acquisition marketing and drive higher repeat sales weve also launched our directtodevice capability which puts the simplicity of our financing application and the power of our underwriting in the hands of the contractors and customers as they seek to install a new hvac system replace their windows or repair an oven this directtodevice technology is also being deployed in retailer locations which helps shorten checkout lines and delivers a completely digital solution to apply and buy when in store in short we are excited about the opportunities for growth that we see in our home platform there are certainly some natural tailwinds in the industry that should feel home spend even as life normalizes in a postpandemic world we are actually more excited about the ways in which were leveraging our technological innovations to extend our customer reach enhance the value of the products and services we offer and deepen our competitive differentiation as we continue to execute on our longterm strategy we are driving even greater customer lifetime value for our partners better experiences for their customers and strong returns for our stakeholders with that ill turn the call over to brian brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone as brian mentioned earlier the strong results we achieved during the second quarter reflected a number of factors first healthy consumer with significant savings and pentup demand to spending leading to broadbased purchase volume growth second continued strength in credit quality across our portfolio we continue to closely monitor our portfolio as industrywide forbearance begins to expire across the broader consumer finance landscape and for some customers as rental forbearance also expires finally the strong positioning of our business combined with consistent execution by our team while we maintain focus on efficient delivery of customized financing solutions and digitally enabled customer experiences across our diverse portfolio partners merchants and providers focusing on the healthy consumer who has robust savings and desire to spend in an environment with improving economic trends synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 during the second quarter consumer savings rates remained strong unemployment continued to improve and consumer confidence reached a month high as a result discretionary spend seems to be making gradual return to prepandemic levels in fact a conference board survey from june indicated that there is also healthy interest among consumers to spend on longlasting manufactured goods over the next six months including homes cars and major household appliances which we expect to be a positive tailwind for our home and auto platform in particular across our diverse set of platforms strong consumer spend trends contributed to higher purchase volume compared to last year primarily reflecting stronger purchase volume per account when comparing these trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter and excluding the impact of walmart purchase volume was higher in the second quarter and purchase volume per account was higher this demonstrates strong consumer demand translating the higher spend relative to prepandemic levels dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the purchase volume in the second quarter and increased from last year on a loan receivables basis they accounted for of the portfolio and were flat to the prior year average active accounts were up about compared to last year and new accounts were higher totaling more than million new accounts in the second quarter and over million new accounts yeartodate loan receivables reached billion in the second quarter a slight increase yearoveryear as the periods strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by persistently elevated payment rate this marks the first quarter of the yearoveryear growth since the start of the pandemic payment rate was almost basis points higher when compared to last year which primarily led to a reduction in interest and fees on loans rsa has increased million or from last year and were of average receivables the increase relative to last years second quarter was primarily reflected in the significant improvement in net chargeoffs as a reminder our retailer share arrangements are designed to share in programs performance and when the portfolios are performing better on a riskadjusted basis our partner share in this performance so the rsa is performing as it is designed and the elevated levels weve seen over the last few quarters are reflection of synchronys particular financial strength through the pandemic we continue to expect rsas to decline as net chargeoffs begin to rise with an improved credit performance and a more optimistic macroeconomic environment we reduced our loan loss reserves by million this quarter other income decreased million generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter other expense decreased million due to lower operational losses partially offset by an increase in employee marketing and business development and information processing costs moving to slide and our platform results we saw a broadbased purchase volume growth across all five platforms as consumers have become increasingly confident and remaining local restrictions are being lifted both our health and wellness and diversified value platforms experienced more than growth in purchase volume in health and wellness this primarily reflected lifting of local restrictions on inperson interactions and consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing elective procedures the lifting of state restrictions was also a primary driver of the significant purchase volume growth in our diversified value platform as consumers increased their discretionary spend in categories like clothing and synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 assorted household goods meanwhile purchase volume grew by in our digital platform in home and auto and in lifestyle loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected stabilization or modest growth versus the prior year as the higher purchase volume was partially offset by the elevated payment rates the one exception being our diversified value platform which was also impacted by store closures in average active account trends were mixed on a platform basis up by as much as in digital and down by as much as in health and wellness the active account growth in digital generally reflected the combination of a shift in the timing of an annual promotional events and the ramp up of some of our recent partner launches the active account decline in health and wellness was primarily associated with the continued strength in consumer balance sheets interest and fees were generally down across the platforms with the exception of lifestyle due to lower yield as a result of elevated payment trends weve been discussing ill move to slide to discuss net interest income and margin trends during the quarter the continued combined impacts of the market stimulus and high savings balance built during the pandemic led to higher than the average payment rate across our portfolio as slide shows payment rate ran approximately basis points higher than our five year historical average and about basis points higher relative to last years second quarter its worth noting the gradual moderation in payment rate from april to june at which point the payment rate was and basis point decrease for the march monthly peak of we expect continued gradual moderation in payment rate as consumers continue to spend the excess savings they accumulated resulting from the combined impact of stimulus and slower discretionary spend during the lockdown interest and fees were down about in the second quarter reflecting lower financed charge yield from elevated payment rate trends and continued lower delinquent accounts resulting from our strong credit performance net interest income decreased from last year the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of a basis points yearoveryear improvement driven by favorable interestbearing liabilities cost and mix of interest earning assets partially offset by the pandemics impact on loan receivable yield more specifically interestbearing liabilities cost were a yearoveryear improvement of basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates this provided basis point increase in our net interest margin the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by basis points from to driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter this accounted for a basis point increase in the margin the loan receivables yield was during the second quarter the basis points yearoveryear reduction reflected the impact of higher payment rate and lower interest and fees which we discussed earlier and impacted our net interest margin by basis points we continue to believe that in the second half of the year liquidity will continue to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payment rates should result in a higher interest and fee yields leading to increasing net interest margin synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 next ill cover our key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics for the quarter ill start with the delinquency trends our plus delinquency rate was compared to last year our plus delinquency rate was compared to last year higher payment trends continue to drive delinquency improvements focusing on the net chargeoff trends our net chargeoff rate was compared to last year our reduction in net chargeoff rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trends as customer behavior pattern improved over the last several quarters our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was as far as our credit outlook is concerned were monitoring trends in our portfolio closely as the accounts enrolls a multiple forbearance programs rolloff but have not seen any indication in our portfolio todate our best expectation at this time is that delinquencies should begin to rise sometime in the back half of leading to peak delinquencies in mid2022 this would translate a net chargeoff peak in late moving to slide ill cover expenses for the quarter overall expenses were down million or from last year to million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs and remain disciplined in managing our expense base specifically the decrease was driven by lower operational losses partially offset by increased employee marketing and business development and information processing costs the efficiency ratio for the second quarter was compared to last year the main driver of the increase of the efficiency ratio was a negative impact from lower revenue that resulted from a combination of lower receivables and lower interest and fee yields this is partially offset by a reduction in expenses moving to slide given the reduction in our loan receivables in and early and the strength in our deposit platform we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity while we believe its prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate as a result of this strategy there was a shift in our mix of funding during the quarter our deposits declined billion from last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by billion this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year with securitized funding comprising and unsecured funding comprising of our funding sources at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets down from last year before i provide details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which had two primary benefits first it delays the effect of the cecl transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment with this framework we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points above last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio increased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis was compared to last year reflecting the impact of the retained net income during the quarter we returned million to shareholders which included million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of per share during the quarter we also announced the approval of a billion share repurchase program through june as well as our plans to maintain our regularly quarterly dividend synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 our business generates a considerable amount of capital thanks to the scalability of our digital capabilities utility of our diversified product suite and the prioritization of growth at attractive risk adjusted returns we will continue to take an opportunistic approach to returning capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions as we exit the pandemic and the environment normalizes were confident in our capabilities and positioning of our business we are emerging from this period as a stronger and more dynamic company and were excited about the opportunities we see to drive strong financial results and shareholder value i will now turn the call back over to brian for his final thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian while the pandemic has presented our company in the world with never before seen challenges synchrony has continued to rise to the occasion facilitating the evolution of many of our partners as a new operating environment has been ushered in we have a truly unique understanding of the partners we serve and the customer needs they seek to address we have an almost year history in consumer financing we have continued to invest in our comprehensive product suite amass our proprietary data and leverage our advanced analytics to achieve targeted outcomes for each of the merchants we work with we have been consistently investing in digital innovation for years and have demonstrated how effectively we can adapt to deliver the value of our partners have come to expect while also driving strong financial results and attractive returns for our shareholders with that ill now turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin our questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question is from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning so brian doubles you mentioned an early indication of consumer resurgence im just curious which macro data points and micro ones give you the most encouragement and then i guess the question im getting quite a bit is what the setup is for loan growth with us moving away from stimulus and there being other benefits coming from the government like the tax credits and obviously infrastructure maybe you could just help us think through all of that thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah hey sanjay so look i think no matter where you look we feel pretty bullish around what were seeing in the economy consumer confidence continues to build the trends on retail sales and spending all of that is translating into really good spend on our card so as we look across our five platforms it really is broadbased purchase volume growth yearoveryear really strong across all five platforms the fact that we were up versus i think is a really good indication so its not just that were comping against a weak it really is broadbased growth across the company and then as you look at kind of per account purchase volume per account was up so thats another positive indicator and then this is a little more anecdotal but as we talked to our partners no matter what segment were in theyre seeing a lot of pentup demand to spend the providers in carecredit theyre booking appointments now three four months out theyre opening the practices on saturdays and sundays to keep up with the volume so i know thats a little more anecdotal but as our teams are out every day talking to the partners theyre in the stores theyre just seeing and feeling a lot of pentup demand to spend and i dont know brian if you want to add to that a little bit on brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the only thing i would add sanjay to that is as we look at savings rates you clearly see the consumer who increased their savings in the beginning part of the pandemic when stimulus happened that came back down in line with historical averages towards the end of ph egen saw that lift here in the end of the first quarter into the second quarter with the stimulus actions we begin we see now across the largest banks that beginning to trail down a little bit so some of those will come back in line clearly with the spending behavior patterns as well as the increase in the financial obligations as mortgage forbearance auto forbearances and the enhanced unemployment benefits began to fade here in the back half of the year brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 yeah i think sanjay you touched on receivables growth that will absolutely come we had four out of our five platforms had receivables growth the payment rate is a little bit tough to predict but we dont see anything that is permanent inside of the portfolio so i do think we will see a reversion to the mean around payment rate and based on the spend that were seeing on our cards receivables growth will absolutely come and were starting to see some positive signs there in like i said four out of our five platforms this quarter sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thats a perfect and just a followup theres a couple of portfolios that have been out there mentioned to be for rfp im just curious how you are seeing your pipeline develop in terms of deal portfolio acquisition except from maybe you could just touch on that and just one clarification brian wenzel the framework for key drivers from last quarter i mean it sounds like most of them stand but i just wanted to clarify that they still stand thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so let me start on the pipeline question sanjay so i would say across all five platforms weve got a good pipeline of new opportunities one of the benefits of the reorganization is our teams are getting even deeper and aligned by industry and weve got some fresh set of eyes on certain things and were looking at opportunities for new programs and startups that are a little bit unconventional a little bit creative and i think thats a great sign and kind of part of what we are trying to achieve with the reorg i would tell you most of the opportunities that were seeing in the pipeline are startups or new programs with a couple exceptions of things that are out there that were looking at that that have existing portfolios but again strong pipeline across all five platforms brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah sanjay to your framework question so the lack of the page i wouldnt confuse with the fact that were changing that framework again i think when you look at what we put out in the first quarter we highlighted the continued high payment rates that will impact loan growth in the first half of the year thats going to continue we do think it begins to abate in the back half of the year so i think from the purchase volume and receivable growth standpoint its the same clearly the elevated payment rate and persistency of that will provide a little bit of headwind and net interest margin as we move into the back half of the year from a credit perspective the higher payment rate really has given us what id say almost pristine type credit so i think youll see in the back half of the year and really for the full year for the company were going to be sub4 on a loss rate perspective which is remarkable for this business given the high margins and then the rsa following those trends will be a little bit more elevated in the back half of the year which again is working as its designed to share in the upside performance of the company so thats how i think about its largely consistent with what weve said back in the first quarter so sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks sanjay brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks operator thank you our next question is from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions good new customer activity maybe can you tell us how much of that was say from the new work channels like venmo and verizon maybe just give us kind of an update on call it the maturation of those two new programs brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john so we obviously cant break out any specific performance on the programs but i can just talk generally about both venmo is doing really well were in full launch mode i would say performance is better than our expectations so far we are getting really great feedback from the customers around just the val prop and the fact that we maximized rewards in those spend categories they love the card design they love the qr code the ability to split payments and share and so that programs off to a great start its still early but all of the key indicators that we look at are performing really well and similarly on verizon this is another program for us that will be a top program in the future performing ahead of our expectations i think great feedback on the val prop its definitely behaving like a top of wallet card which is what we intended that was the goal and so were seeing really good spend on verizon products and even and outside as well so off to a great start on both and like i said i think these can both be top programs for us in the future john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay very good thanks and then brian im wondering just maybe if you could give us a high level kind of quick discussion again on the state of the market and really what im kind of interested in is youve got some new kind of emerging market participants in the buy now pay later product and so forth and im kind of getting wondering what your sense is for kind of underwriting quality across the spectrum and kind of competitive factors across the spectrum given the changing elements of the market brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john its a great question i think obviously there are always new entrants in the buy now pay later space i think its pretty clear at this point that every financial service provider out there will offer a buy now pay later synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 product equal pay financing is a big part of our business already we highlighted we do over billion of balances currently on equal pay products we offer those products over locations so our goal at the end of the day is to have a multiproduct multicapability solution i think ultimately thats whats going to win and thats what were offering to our providers in terms of the competitive dynamics its hard to tell how others are underwriting like what i can tell you is weve been in this business a long time it is really important to stay disciplined which means you dont go a lot deeper in really good times and you try not to contract too much in bad times because we know that our partners really value that stability the consistency of our underwriting and they get used to a certain approval rate and we try to protect that in both good times and bad times and as we all know if youve been in this business a long time if you do take on substantially more risk and youre winning business by lowering your underwriting standards and thats a losing strategy over the longterm and so thats not how we operate and weve got a very experienced disciplined credit team and look we want to win business based on our products and capabilities based on our technology our partnership model we never want to win business based on just going deeper and taking on more risk john hecht q analyst jefferies llc really i appreciate the update thanks very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks john brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john operator and we have our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes brian can you talk a little bit about the child tax credit digging a little bit more for example do you think that will lead to higher payment rates in july versus june and how do you think about the overall materiality of it versus prior stimulus brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks don obviously an influx of billion of cash on top of whats already out there is clearly not going to be beneficial that being said being its targeted to folks that earn less thats a pull forward really from im not necessarily sure it will have a material impact necessarily on our payment rates as we look in the beginning part of july we have not seen a real elevation of the payment rates are more consistent with what we saw as we exited out of june so i dont really see any data yet that says that thats going to be a potential synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 problem more certainly well watch and see whether or not that becomes a permanent credit and a permanent pull forward as legislation gets enacted later on this year so well continue to watch it don donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you im all set brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don have a good day operator and we have our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc ive a couple questions just the first one you talked through the nim and the loan growth and how its being impacted by the payment rates et cetera but could you speak to how much the loan growth and potentially nim is impacted by some of these new entrants that weve been seeing and discussing here be it either bnpl or other kinds of payment schemes that enable people to really shift some of their spending away from what might have been their primary payment device im just wondering if thats had any impact brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah betsy ill let brian chime in here but what were seeing is really attributed to the higher payment rate just because consumers balance sheets are stronger than theyve ever been and i think that is the primary driver i dont think this is competitive pressure in any way but ill let brian add some color to that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah ill just point back to a couple of things betsy first when you look at our new account origination the million new accounts up versus so were not seeing and even when we look down at the providers that may have alternative type of products at least buy now pay later products were not seeing a real impact relative to new accounts synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 we also dont really see it in the payment rate where were kind of going through it really is as brian pointed out the accumulated savings rates that youve seen and stimulus that has flowed through the consumer thats really driving the pressure against purchase volume and headwind on to net interest margin which is producing tremendous credit which we sometimes put in the back mirror but the credit is really terrific right now so we will continue to monitor but we dont see an impact from the alternative players betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc great okay now i got it and clearly credit is a part of a mass here so its a little bit surprising when people only look at like a ppop instead of including the credit in there i agree i guess the other question i have on this is with regard to deposit products that you might be planning or thinking of offering because when you think about the bnpl the pay in the pure pay in i know there is different bnpls but the pure pay in should be financed or funded with a checking account right i mean you shouldnt be paying for your pay in with a card balance but i just wanted to understand how youre thinking about that when youre developing your own products and whether or not we should be anticipating more in the way of deposit products coming out from you thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah no i mean betsy its a great question and we agree you shouldnt pay out one credit product with another credit product so we agree with that i think were looking at some alternative kind of savings products as part of our broader product strategy buy now pay later is obviously top of mind right now across i think all issuers like i said i think everybody will have a version of it we have billion of balances today as i said and were rolling out some new capabilities and features in the second half of the year so nothing i can get too specific at this point but more to comment definitely part of our multiproduct strategy that i touched on earlier betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks betsy have a good day operator thank you our next question is from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 hey everybody thanks for taking my questions this morning brian you did a great job highlighting the impact of home and auto on the portfolio im curious with the changes in the composition over the last several years how important you think backtoschool is particularly in light of the challenges for backtoschool spending last year brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah backtoschool hasnt been a big driver for us for a number of years rick which is kind of surprising we just we dont see a ton of volume there and i think its not as much of an event as it was probably an event you and i were growing up it was more of an event i know even for my girls they dont there isnt a backtoschool event where they all go get new clothes and stuff for school so we tend to see that spend space out over a longer period of time and its less of a spike for us so i think that trend will continue even in the new paradigm richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it i appreciate that im chuckling because you know me well enough to know that my clothing budget is not that great either even when i was a kid thanks guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks rick operator and we have our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks brian im hoping that you could kind of talk a little bit about the kinds of conversations that you have with your large retail partners about bnpl in other words i have to believe that they are quite invested in the success of your programs given they earned a significant amount of money whereas on bnpl theyre kind of paying a significant amount of money and so kind of maybe could you just obviously not asking about any specific partner but what are those conversations like brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah its a great question moshe i think a lot of our partners are still in kind of the evaluation phase where they look at the buy now pay later product and they obviously see a customer desire for that product right and a customer demand for it but one of the big questions is as you pointed out its around economics and its still early there and i think some retailers are willing to pay what is a pretty steep merchant discount rate if they believe that they are attracting new customers and theyre getting sales that they wouldnt otherwise get but when they look at that comparison they look at compared to some of our products where not only do we not charge interchange were also paying them quite a bit through the rsa and they look at that and they say okay clearly economically they would prefer that the purchase goes on the private label card or cobrand card because its much better for them financially and so to the extent that they stop believing that theyre actually getting incremental purchases or new customers then the economic tradeoff is very clear and so i do think down the road theres an economic reckoning that will happen as this plays out and its still early in terms of these products and how theyre offered synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 the other thing i would mention is that the other advantage and the things that we hear from our partners is they like the lifetime relationship that a card provides they can do lifecycle marketing they can do promotions and offers over number of years and one of the things that we talk a lot about with our partners and one of the things that we measure across all of our partners is repeat purchases and we talked to you guys a lot about that as well because that has been a big focus for us over the last five years and one of the things that frankly our partners look to us for is that ongoing customer loyalty we measure that we look at it by customer when was the last time they made a purchase okay lets send them a customized offer or promotion so they really like that ability to do that lifecycle marketing so i think its a combination of economics and thats still kind of a tbd and how all this is going to shake out but the other thing that we hear across the board is they want to have a longterm relationship with the customer they really value the loyalty that a lot of our products provide moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you and my followup question for brian wenzel i mean you kind of highlighted the impact of late fees along with the payment rate could you just talk a little bit about how that comes back like what is the timeframe is it kind of early stage delinquencies how should we think about that normalization of that factor brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah great question moshe i think the way we kind of think about credit outlook now delinquencies build towards latter part of this year heading into so late fees will begin to come back as you see the entry rate in delinquency begin to rise so that will come first before you get into the chargeoff so if you believe that the latter part of this year youll begin to see the yield impact benefit coming from higher late fees in the portfolio moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe have a good day operator and thank you our next question comes mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks i had the question about the nim can you help us think about the lift that you may get from both the normalization of the payment rate to kind of the longterm historic average and also maybe the normalization of liquidity as a percentage of assets brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 yeah so the way i would think about lets take liquidity first in the portfolio so clearly weve been able to burn off some of that liquidity here in the second quarter both through the billion in asset growth that we had as well as the acceleration of some of the maturities in the funding profile so were running over billion continued excess liquidity as we enter into the back half of the year if you take out all the excess liquidity from here theres probably another basis points out to the net interest margin that youd see a lift from again weve highlighted before you probably have to basis points from benchmark rates so put that off to the side the residual comes in probably two fashions one is late fees which youre probably to basis points of lift going back to a normalized late fee load so not even at a ph loss rate higher than but your normal load and then you have the residual which will be the revolve when ph payment rates come back in line so the one thing id say is we do not see anything in the portfolio today that gives us any indication that the net interest margin in that realm is not going to be the mean that we go back to and well be continue to watch it but theres nothing fundamentally or structurally that we think is different its just really the timing to get there given the excess liquidities that the consumer has and that theyre going to deploy here in the short term mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thats helpful and then just a followup question on brian on your comments about your partners really wanting to kind of stimulate the longer lifecycle with customers do they find that using the revolving product where theyve got incentives on spend is the best way to do that as opposed to offering some type of or maybe a lower rate kind of fixed loan product on balances brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah mark i mean it really does vary by partner but i would say the majority particularly the larger partners they see the value of the value prop right the rewards the loyalty that that drives when they go into one of our large partners and a lot of times theyre saving that is really meaningful we do that at amazon we do at lowes we do at number of places now and thats a great way to incent that repeat purchases i think the other thing that weve been doing for a number of years now is and most of partners we store the card as the default payment type right and so you dont even have to think about it it just goes right on the card you get your and thats something that our partners have been very focused on as well to drive that again the lifetime relationship with the cardholder and the loyalty that comes with it mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay and i assume they also get the fastest checkout using the revolving products correct brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah i mean its just incent right its stored as i know for amazon for me its stored as my default i get my i dont even think about it it just automatically goes on the card so its certainly the easiest fastest way to check out for most of our partners synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mark operator and thank you our next question is from mihir bhatia with bank of america nathaniel richamodoi q analyst bofa securities inc hi this is nate richam ph online for mihir bhatia thanks for taking my question im curious about how program costs are trending and i know you dont typically comment on specific portfolios ph but are your rewards for consumers increasing for ph newer portfolios like for instance ive noticed what prominent rewards ph promotions for venmo im just curious thats additive or representative with a broader portfolio and trying to get new customers brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah your quality wasnt that clear are you asking about the loyalty cost trends nathaniel richamodoi q analyst bofa securities inc right is that increasing for the newer portfolios like ive seen venmo had like more promotions and rewards im wondering if thats additive or representative with broader portfolio for new customer acquisitions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah the way i would think about the loyalty cost first our volume is up significantly yearoveryear and up versus so youre going to see a general trend in loyalty cost higher more certainly the new programs of verizon and venmo will have those costs that are in there it probably slightly higher percent of the asset because the assets just beginning to build but its not significantly different than our overall portfolio not necessarily the drivers really the increase purchase volume across the entire portfolio thats driving our value prop and loyalty costs nathaniel richamodoi q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you thats it for me synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial great thank you operator and we have our next question from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey thanks so much for taking my questions can you we obviously have the new segments that youve broken out the new platforms can you talk about the differences in each of the platforms that have made you decide to break them up this way and as far as the marketing teams the gotomarket strategy and if they are actually running a software thats different among them thanks so much guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure so the reason to reorganize and align more by industry was a couple fold first in terms of to your point the products and capabilities that we offer tend to align better by industry and even more important than that how we integrate in the products and capabilities and how we integrate them into the digital environment or the store footprint tends to align as well by industry so one example for our purely digital players paypal venmo amazon were integrating through our api technology or through sypi technology right inside of their app and thats a different than what we would do in home and auto where for some of our larger partners were integrating both in their digital environment mobile online but we also have tools and technologies to apply and buy instore and so because of the product suite tends to be catered more towards the industry because of the types of products that theyre selling as well as whether or not they are purely digital or have a store footprint it just made more sense to align by industry id say the second piece of this and we saw this in carecredit over the last years it really is an advantage to get really deep domain expertise in an industry and one of the things that i think has been a secret to our success in carecredit is that domain expertise our teams get they build lifetime relationships they get really deep in the different domains that we support dental that et cetera and were trying to replicate that in these other platforms so those were the two primary reasons i can tell you its been great just a couple of months in having these teams in place looking at these segments differently its seeing kind of natural synergies and ideas for new products and capabilities as were out talking to partners and thinking about it more within industry than to it so far the progress has been really great dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thank you for that detail and then this might be a longshot but can you talk about the tender share by each of those and if not specific numbers because i know thats unlikely maybe just perhaps which one of the segments is at the average tender share below and above average of the whole company and then when we think about the rsa in the second quarter is that the high watermark if you think about ncl rate stay roughly fairly in line with where they are for the rest of this year is that the high watermark on a percentage basis for the rsa thank you very much i really appreciate it guys synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah let me start on the kind of the penetration question i would say across each of those platforms weve got significant room to grow penetration inside of each of those platforms we have we have startup programs where were relatively small percentage of the payments inside of those programs and we have very mature programs where we can be pen what i can tell you is we measure our teams on increasing that penetration rate regardless of where they are at so even for the more mature programs our teams that are embedded inside of our partners they get measured based on growth and driving that incremental tender share so even in our mature programs we are very focused on that the penetration rate i dont know brian if you want to take the second piece of that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so rsa as you think about rsa in the back half the two factors really to focus on is one the purchase volume right because as rsa is not only sharing there is volume oriented purchases so the strength in purchases you see in the back half of the year and then how the net chargeoff and provision line continues to develop i mentioned earlier in the call we expect the ncl rate for the full year to be below but if there are incremental acl releases that could impact it so well remain elevated in the back half of the year from where we are historically but it should be dramatically larger than what we saw in the second quarter dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks so much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you kathryn harmon miller a senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial operator we have time for one more question operator and thank you our last question is from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning as you look to further out do you see the normalization of the payment rates providing a tailwind to the normalization of your revolve rates such that we can see a loan growth starts to outpace your spending growth if you could speak to that dynamic brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah clearly weve said that we believe payment rate will move back to the mean that will accelerate loan growth and more certainly if you had a slowing purchase volume market that could push the loan growth ahead of the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2021 purchase volume growth again the way weve thought about the back half of the year and it hasnt really changed in the back half heading into that you are going to continue to see elevated purchase volume one from pentup demand that we see and as we talk to our partners merchants and providers that youre going to see the consumer who has the wherewithal with the savings to continue to spend so i think over the next months youre going to continue to see elevated purchase volume bill and then youre going to combine that with a moderation of the payment rate to the mean over time so the two will work in concert bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and then separately on capital there has been some skepticism around your ability to get on to pure levels of capital can you speak to what gives you confidence that you can get there and i might have missed this but any commentary on the potential for increasing the authorization above your current plan brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah bill im going to first point you back to a little bit of the history right as we separated from ge we had an capital level we had worked that down to over a couple of years three four years so weve demonstrated the ability weve demonstrated the ability just before the pandemic to take that capital i think billion in the nine month period before the pandemic happened so i think we have the ability and demonstrated capability to do that so i think were confident in our ability to get down there now with regard to the current authorization right we talked about this a little bit in the first quarter that is a backwards looking authorization right so the data which we used through on our stress scenarios under our processes and governance mechanisms were based off of december and early january assumptions right so thats where we had the capital plan put together and approved by our board if things continue to change well evaluate whether or not there is a desire for the broad leadership team to increase that authorization level and well revisit that but right now we have billion remaining weve executed million so far this year which were slightly regulated by the restrictions put on by the fed and we will be aggressive with regard to our execution against the billion and again if the environment warrants well revisit that bill carcache q
