over to bryan mckeag htlfs chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today by referencing our earnings release which outlines our strong quarterly results with earnings per share reported at million of nonppp loan growth improved credit metrics and continued deposit growth but before i go into my detailed comments ill like to remind you that you can find additional information on the quarter in the second quarter investor presentation which is available in the ir section of our website so ill start my comments today with the provision for credit losses which totaled a million benefit this quarter primarily driven by an improved economic outlook and included the following favorable trends first as weve already noted total loan balances grew million exppp second i believe this is the first quarter since early that loan upgrades exceeded downgrades and at the same time nonperforming loans declined million or third consensus economic forecasts have improved the past two quarters as a result the economic outlook factors used to develop the allowance were upgraded to incorporate a portion of the forecasted economic improvement but the factors still retain a measure of caution and uncertainty that management deems appropriate for lingering economic headwinds that are yet to be resolved and last net chargeoffs were manageable this quarter at just under million or basis points of total loans these chargeoffs were on loans that had previously been identified and had established reserves and therefore had minimal effect on the quarters provision so at quarterend the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments stood at million or of total loans when the ppp loan balances are excluded the total allowance stands at in addition at quarterend unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaled million or basis points of total loans excluding ppp heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 moving to the rest of the balance sheet investments grew million this quarter and comprise just over of assets with a taxequivalent yield of duration under years and generate about million of monthly cash flow borrowings decreased million to end the quarter at million or of assets the tangible common equity ratio increased basis points to at the quarter end the tce ratio rose basis points due to the increase in market value of investments and gained basis points from retained earnings net of balance sheet growth this quarter htlfs regulatory capital ratios also remained strong with common equity tier at just under and total risk based at just over so the balance sheet continues to be very strong and well positioned moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million higher than the prior quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was thats down basis points compared to last quarter during the quarter investment yields declined basis point and loan yields declined basis points these are offset by a basis point drop in interest costs the margin was positively impacted by a increase in ppp fees recognized primarily due to a full quarter of ppp loan amortization and increased the net interest margin by basis points over last quarter we exited the quarter with just over million of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books also this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was down basis points from the prior quarter noninterest income totaled million for the quarter thats up million from last quarter total mortgage banking revenue was down million but largely offset by security gains which increased million compared to last quarter in addition service charges were million higher and trust fees were up representing an and increase respectively compared to last quarter shifting to noninterest expense noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter up million from last quarter excluding acquisition integration restructuring and tax credit costs and asset gains and losses our core expenses increased million to million compared to million last quarter the increase was primarily attributable to professional fees where automation and other digital technology project costs were higher on the positive side both employee and facilityrelated expenses were lower as ftes declined by and the remaining cost saves from our aim integration were realized so as we look ahead to the second half of and start to develop some views about we believe htlf will continue to deliver strong results highlighted by strong loan pipelines leading to an expected loan growth rate exppp in the to range per quarter going forward as the economy continues to strengthen remaining round one ppp forgiveness will happen largely over the next one or two quarters and ppp two forgiveness will occur mainly over the next two or three quarters we anticipate that ppp reductions will be replaced by nonppp loan growth and some bridge investments and as a result modest growth in earning assets is expected going forward nontime deposit growth is likely to slow and could even show some slight run off in the back half of the year with moderate to low low to moderate growth expected in the net interest margin will continue to be pressured however net interest income excluding ppp fees is projected to grow to per quarter going forward as earning assets grow and our mix improves provisions for credit losses are expected to remain low and could be negative again in the next quarter or two and then return to more normal levels as loan growth continues and the economy stabilizes in noninterest income excluding investment gains or losses in total is expected to increase modest modestly over the next two quarters from the million this quarter core expenses are expected to remain flat in the heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 million to million range per quarter in the back half of as professional fees are projected to remain at current levels as we continue to invest in and complete projects and initiatives we believe a tax rate is a reasonable fullyear run rate assuming we get no tax law changes and lastly we expect the tce ratio to climb back above by yearend as we get about basis points increase from retained earnings per quarter however a return to higher interest rates would weigh negatively on the ratio with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc well now open the call up to questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting the questionandanswer session operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thank you good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeffrey bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co on the loan growth front kind of more than doubled your expectations just wanted to kind of see what happened in the quarter is it payoff subsided new demand a bit of timing and then so thats kind of part one and then part two just if you could color that with any geographies that were particularly productive andor kind of within segment thanks bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah jeff i think that we did in our minds kind of overachieve what our forecast was but it really was the culmination of our pipeline and a lot of those new relationships which i referenced about new relationships thats been a focus going forward and were just very fortunate as we won new business and won market share almost across the board in all of our markets and we were able to get those loans closed during the quarter but with that we have a very strong and almost equal pipeline to what we had going into the second quarter some areas where we saw that growth that was in core manufacturing healthcare distribution were key areas and we heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 saw the growth really both in the midwest and in the west we especially had solid growth in colorado arizona california texas and in the midwest really the dubuque in iowa kind of led that group so it was very kind of consistent across all of our markets and as i went through the various portfolios we had solid growth really across the board jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it thank you and maybe ill circle back to bryan on the expense line you talked about professional services staying perhaps elevated you talked about kind of the expenses flat to million or million whats the difference there did you have some onetime in the expense that we should back out bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah well i think obviously projects and consultants are in there so as we do projects some of that moves around but i think that that line was higher than when id given guidance last quarter part of that is we did think about upping our timing of some of our projects moving things forward given that we had the fee income benefit that was going to come from ppp so itll be a little bit higher than i thought for the last half of the year were still working on what its going to be for next year but we will continue to fund projects that we think have good paybacks and work on digital technology and tools and applications so maybe a little bit down next year than what we spent this year but were going to continue to invest bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah jeff this is bruce i would just say and i mentioned several of the investments that are ongoing for us we made a conscious decision to accelerate some investments that we had planned on in into and thats why were seeing those elevated expenses but i would say theyre all around customer experience and improving how the customers interface with us from a digital perspective jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and sorry i just have one last one on the ma front and you guys have been pretty active on the ma discussions and i think youve really signaled california was there was quite a few conversations there obviously weve seen some deals just wanted to kind of check back in and see any territories in particular that youre eyeballing or seem to have some momentum lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc yeah jeff this lynn fuller were seeing a lot of activity some of the activity were just simply passing on because its too small or its not a good fit and weve lost a couple deals because where our stock is trading for a larger transaction its a little difficult to make those work and still stay committed to our financial performance metrics but were still looking at deals in colorado denver area and arizona and the phoenix area kansas and in the kansas city area texas west texas specifically and california and well be making a number of calls this week in california and last week i was in montana so theres no shortage of opportunities its just a matter of finding the right ones and kind of sorting through them heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate it thank you operator and your next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc good afternoon terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc bryan thanks for all the financial outlook thats always very helpful maybe ill start the rollout of htlf was it in april we talked about it last quarter im just curious three months into that whats been the early feedback and are you hearing what you were expecting and has it been effective bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc terry this is bruce its met our expectations i guess is how we would say it we think that htlf is more contemporary its easier for some of our customers to understand and every one of our markets uses the kind of financial strength of htlf a little differently and some of our tag lines are rocky mountain bank powered by htlf to try to explain a little better than we have historically the billion of resources and assets behind each one of our member banks and i think that were starting to see that in a positive way as weve gone upmarket and attracted new customers from a commercial loan standpoint terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and maybe ask a question on slide which is the htlf digital strategy somebody put a meaningful amount of time into that slide bruce whats the key takeaway from that slide and then from an expense standpoint theres still a lot of work in progress icons there where are you and maybe using the baseball analogy what inning are you in it in terms of the expense side to then kind of checking all those boxes off so to speak bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah im going to let bryan take the kind of what inning were in but i think that the big takeaway here is that we are focused on the customer and the customer changes or their behavior and were trying to get out in front of heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 what the customer expectations are clearly our industry is being disrupted on many many fronts and we want to become one of those disruptors and make it easier for all of our customers to do business with as i mentioned when i was talking about the consumer loan growth i think it was of all the loans that we originated were done online a year ago we didnt have that opportunity for us so those investments are beginning to pay off for us and thats whats enabling us to prune our branches as well as attract a different type of commercial customer than we ever have in the past so bryan from an inning perspective bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say were probably in the middle innings here i think weve got lots of things that you can see that are under flight that were working on a few weve got ticked off i think the ones just generally on the top part of that page are the ones that were excited about those are going to really help our growth in our account acquisition so some more to go which is why i think i probably and when we talked last quarter probably didnt have this factored in correctly and why our expenses are up a little bit and some of these will go into next year as well so theyre not short just quick hit projects these are bigger projects that have that take a little bit of time were excited about them and i think were really committed to them and really enhance our capabilities bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and terry i think bryan said it right the top half those two are really again customerfacing the bottom half is much more about infrastructure necessary to support the top half and one of the reasons those consulting expenses went up is internally based upon what we already had in flight we were pretty much at capacity we wanted to accelerate these so we had to bring in outside resources to help accelerate them terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great appreciate the color thanks guys have a nice night bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks operator your next question will come from andrew liesch with piper sandler bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey andrew heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc andrew are you there operator andrew your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi sorry oh my god i apologize for that my phone was on mute there bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc indiscernible andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co so youve covered most of my questions just one on the utilization rate on page or slide obviously trailing five quarters have been depressed just given the environment but where can that eventually get back to and any sort of timing on what you expect it could return to bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc was it line utilization is that your question andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co yeah the in the second quarter i mean the trailing five quarters only goes back to but thats kind of early on in the pandemic so i guess what would it have been before the pandemic hit and any expectation on your timing on when it could get back there bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i think we would have been in the mid to upper if you would go back and look at say the end of and honestly andrew this has been one of the things that weve been i guess wrong on in the last couple of quarters because we thought that commercial balances in particular would not necessarily continue to grow we would start to see some additional utilization but thats just not the case right now so i dont know that we can give you good guidance on when its going to start going up we do think that weve sort of hit bottom but we dont think itll continue to trend downward andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 got it okay so then presumably it sounds like a lot of this any commercial growth you have going forward is going to be continued market share gains bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc that is true andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co cool yeah youve covered everything else thanks so much bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks andrew operator operator instructions and your next question will come from damon delmonte with kbw damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys i hope everybody is doing well today bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc were doing great hey damon damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great most of my questions have been answered but just kind of curious on the outlook here for the reserve level going forward i think bryan you had mentioned that it could be potentially negative or very low for the heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2021 upcoming quarters i think youre at right now right now whats a comfort level for you guys how far down would you let that go bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc well i guess i would answer that if you kind of look and i dont know what page it is in our deck bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc ill get the page bryan bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc but if you look back when we implemented cecl day one we were at about basis points and that was as you might recall under really good economic circumstances we hadnt kind of hit covid covid was still only in japan really or china we hadnt really had any big impact here then if you look at the next quarter it was coming in yeah its on page bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and if you look at the first quarter when we started to have give impact to that the covid and the economy was starting to have some worries that bumped up to really basis points bruce and i and nathan and nathan you can jump in i think were thinking somewhere in the range of exppp we should be in the to 125ish range under pretty decent economic conditions damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thats helpful thats good color and then just one other kind of question here i think bruce you may have mentioned about a longerterm reduction in branches of around over time was that like a hard and fast decision you guys have made already or is that something youre just saying in general given the usage trends of customers you could see yourselves reducing branches by another bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc ill answer it two ways we definitely feel that we will be reducing by we do have a process thats ongoing and we expect to have it completed here in the third quarter on sort of specifically how many and we should be able to provide you guidance at the end of the third quarter on exactly how many and when damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats helpful thats all that i had thanks a lot guys appreciate it heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q2 earnings call
