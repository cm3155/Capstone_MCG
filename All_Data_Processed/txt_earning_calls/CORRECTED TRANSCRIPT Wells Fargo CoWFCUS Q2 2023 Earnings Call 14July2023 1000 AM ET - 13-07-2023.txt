president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thank you john good morning everyone as usual ill make some brief comments about our second quarter results and then update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with some second quarter highlights we had solid results in the quarter with revenue pretax pre provision profit diluted earnings per share and rotce all higher than a year ago the revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income while our efficiency ratio improved and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives we had modest expense growth from a year ago net chargeoffs have continued to increase from historical low levels but overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy we increased our allowance for credit losses by million primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio while we havent seen significant losses in our office portfolio to date our detailed loan by loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out weve also considered a number of stress scenarios all of which inform our actions this quarter mike will discuss this in more detail but i want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio loss contents will be driven by a combination of factors including but not limited to property type location lease rates lease renewal notice dates loan structure and borrower behavior most importantly our cre teams remain focused on working with our clients portfolio surveillance and derisking to minimize loss contents both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed and weve taken some credit tightening actions credit card spending remains strong but the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw throughout debit card spending was flat from a year ago with growth in discretionary spend offset by declines in nondiscretionary spend average deposits were down from the first quarter driven by lower consumer deposits while the decline in commercial deposits slowed now let me update you on progress weve made on our strategic priorities starting with our risk and control work regulatory pressure on banks with longstanding issues such as ours continues to grow and as such our continued intensive effort to complete the buildout of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical ive continued to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so and that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required we have more implementation to do as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time as i said before we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete while were devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work were also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth our consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app we added over million mobile active customers over the past year and mobile logins increased from a year ago fargo our new aipowered virtual assistant is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers since launching at the end of april our customers have interacted with fargo over million times we continue to make important hires bringing new expertise to wells fargo in businesses we are looking to grow we named barry simmons as the new head of national sales in wealth and investment management he will be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisors grow their business wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 we also continued to attract veteran bankers in corporate and investment banking hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas including a cohead of global mergers and acquisitions cohead of financial institutions and new heads of financial sponsors equity capital markets healthcare and technology media and telecom we also continue to focus on better serving our communities we announced a 10year strategic partnership with td jakes group that could result in up to billion in capital and financing from wells fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across america the wells fargo foundation awarded million to habitat for humanity to build and repair more than homes nationwide weve worked with habitat for humanity for nearly decades and donated more than million since wells fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of unidosus home initiative to create million new latino homeowners by we provided the initial grant to start a fund launched by fintech hello alice to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups including women we continue to open hope inside centers to wells fargo branches including six during the first half of with plans to reach more by the end of this year the centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one on one coaching we published our diversity equity and inclusion report which highlights the progress weve made in our dei strategy and initiatives both inside our company and in communities where we live and work however we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require a longterm commitment looking ahead the us economy continues to perform better than many expected and although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters this years federal reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model this capital strength allows us to serve our customers financial needs while continuing to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders as we previously announced we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by to per share subject to approval by the companys board of directors as its regularly scheduled meeting later this month weve repurchased billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock regulators have signaled that the basel iii end game proposal which could be out as soon as this summer will include higher capital requirements that will be skewed to the countrys largest banks while theres some speculation that capital requirements could increase by we dont know what the impact will be to wells fargo however we do expect our capital requirements will increase while any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years we are considering the potential impact to be contemplating the amount of our future repurchases our balance sheet is strong weve increased and remained focus on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position we remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and are steadfast commitment to our risk and control buildout coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit first management allows us to support our customers through economic cycles i will now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the second quarter was billion or per diluted common share both up from a year ago reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance which ill highlight throughout the call starting with capital and liquidity on slide our cet1 ratio was down approximately basis points from the first quarter during the second quarter we repurchased billion in common stock and as charlie highlighted subject to board approval we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter our cet1 ratio is percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffers starting in the fourth quarter of this year while we expect to repurchase more common stock this year we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there is more clarity on new capital requirements that charlie highlighted our liquidity position remains strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately percentage points above the regulatory minimum turning to credit quality on slide overall credit quality remains strong but as expected net loan chargeoffs continue to increase from historically low levels and were basis points of average loans in the second quarter commercial net loan chargeoffs increased million from the first quarter to basis points of average loans approximately half of the increase was in commercial banking where the losses were borrower specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio the rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate primarily in the office portfolio ill share some more details on the cre office exposure on the next slide consumer net loan chargeoffs increased modestly up million from the first quarter to basis points of average loans the increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses decline while consumer credit performance remains solid overall and we continue to take incremental credit tightening actions across the portfolios we expect consumer net loan charge offs will continue to gradually increase nonperforming assets increased from the first quarter as lower non accrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial nonaccrual loans primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio our allowance for credit losses increased million in the second quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card balances weve updated slide which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio we had billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with billion of office loans which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented of our total loans outstanding the office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter as charlie mentioned our cre teams are focused on surveillance and derisking which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring atrisk loans this quarter we added a table to this slide that breaks down our cre office exposure from the context of our broader cre portfolio as the slide shows our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate and investment banking and that is also where we had the most nonaccrual loans and the highest level of allowance for credit losses last quarter we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate and investment bank which increased from at the end of the first quarter to at the end of the second quarter this quarter we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total cre office portfolio which was at the end of the second quarter up from at the end of the first quarter as weve highlighted last quarter were providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio but each property wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 situation is different and there are many variables that can determine performance which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loanbyloan basis for example we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals we also have properties that are well leased and performing but borrowers need help refinancing in those situations we are working with borrowers to restructure which in many cases include some pay down of the balance there are also situations that result in a sale or worked out of the asset we will continue to closely monitor this portfolio but as has been the case in prior cycles this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans were relatively stable from the first quarter and were up from a year ago driven by higher commercial and industrial loans in commercial banking and credit card loans ill highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago and basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment average deposits declined from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives while down from a year ago average commercial deposits were relatively stable from the first quarter and average deposits grew in corporate and investment banking as expected our average deposit cost continued to increase up basis points from the first quarter to basis points from the higher deposit cost across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates our mix of noninterest bearing deposits declined from in the first quarter to in the second quarter but remained above prepandemic levels turning to net interest income on slide second quarter net interest income was billion up from a year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates the million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances partially offset by one additional day in the quarter at the beginning of the year we expected full year net interest income to grow by approximately compared with we currently expect full year net interest income to increase approximately compared with there are a variety of factors that weve considered in our expectation for the rest of the year we are assuming modest growth in loans some additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest bearing to interest bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing including competitive pricing on commercial deposits additionally we are using the recent rate curve which is shown on the slide as a reminder many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense grew million or from a year ago at the beginning of the year we expected our fullyear noninterest expense excluding operating losses to be approximately billion we currently expect our fullyear noninterest expense excluding operating losses to be approximately billion the increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken and plan to take in as attrition has been slower than expected of note weve reduced head count each quarter since the third quarter of and head count declined from the first quarter and from a year ago as a reminder we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses turning to our operating segment starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 higher interest rates was partially offset by lower depositrelated fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year we continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business as customers migrate to digital including mobile weve reduced our number of branches by and branch staffing by from a year ago home lending revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations we continue to reduce head count in the second quarter down from a year ago and we expect staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year credit card revenue increased from a year ago due to the higher loan balances payment rates were down from a year ago but has been stable over the last three quarters and remained above prepandemic levels new account growth remained strong up from a year ago and importantly the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances personal lending revenue was up from a year ago due to higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from a year ago and increased from the first quarter reflecting seasonality we funded our last correspondent loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities the size of our auto portfolio has declined for five consecutive quarters and balances were down at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago origination volume declined from a year ago reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition as charlie highlighted debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago spending on fuel due to lower gas prices home improvement and travel had the largest declines compared to last year credit card spending continued to be strong and was up from a year ago growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down yearoveryear turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased yearoveryear primarily due to higher loan balances average loan balances were up in the second quarter compared to a year ago driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization average loan balances have grown for eight consecutive quarters though the pace of growth has slowed average loans were up from the first quarter with loan growth in assetbased lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels while middle market banking loans were flat turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue the growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected writedowns taken in the second quarter of on unfunded leveraged finance commitments commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances markets revenue increased from a year ago driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent which have allowed us to broaden our franchise and generate more trading flows average loans were down from a year ago and from the first quarter the decline from the first quarter was driven by banking reflecting a combination of slow demand and modestly lower line utilization on slide wealth and investment management revenue was down compared to a year ago driven by a decline in assetbased fees due to lower market valuations growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 cash in a higher yielding alternatives however outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so second quarter results reflected the market valuations as of april which were down from a year ago assetbased fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of july average loans were down from a year ago primarily due to the declines in securitiesbased lending slide highlights our corporate results revenue increased million from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses in summary our results in the second quarter reflect a continued improvement in our earnings capacity we grew revenue and had strong growth in pretax provision profit and as expected our net chargeoffs continue to slowly increase from historical lows and our allowance for credit losses increased we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate our capital levels remain strong and we continue to repurchase common stock we will now take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open sir mr usdin please check the mute button on your phone charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co why dont we take another one and then well come back to ken operator certainly the next question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you for taking the question hey it was great to see the higher nii guide and the performance this quarter that said it seems likely the dollars of nii will come down from here i guess just broadly speaking are you able to chat about what factors might be most important in just sort of your ability to arrest a downward move in nii in other words kind of when and why would it end up flatten out if were ideally getting close to the end of a fed tightening cycle michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah thanks scott its mike ill take that and charlie can jump in if he wants when you look at the assumptions that underpin that and i highlighted some of this in my script but ill kind of go back through them we got a little bit of modest loan growth in there so thats not a big driver of what were seeing and i think youre probably seeing that from others where were just not seeing that same demand that we saw a year or so ago on sort of on loans were also assuming that well see some additional outflows particularly in the consumer space as people continue to spend money and then well see some more migration from noninterest bearing to interest bearing deposits and then deposit pricing will betas will evolve over time i think its still very competitive on the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 commercial side and i think that will continue on the consumer side but it will evolve so i think youve got to look at those combination of factors and make some assumptions around when you think they start to stabilize but i think were assuming that those trends that weve been seeing now for the last couple quarters will continue at least through the yearend scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and maybe if we could drill down into one of those in particular just the migration from noninterest bearing to interest bearing theyve come down but are still above prepandemic levels i believe do you have a sense for where and why those would start to settle out michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean theres a few factors underneath that as you pointed out were about at the end of the quarter down from about i think the prior quarter and if you go back precovid they were in kind of the mid mid to upper depending on when exactly when you look at it and weve been trending downward part of that is excess deposits on the commercial side as people use up their earnings credits for the fees theyre paying youre seeing some migration there that stabilizes and then youve seen again on the consumer side people spending from their primary checking accounts so those are the factors that id look at on when that starts to slow down and stabilize but its been pretty consistent at least for the last quarter or two scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay all right thank you very much mike operator thank you the next question will come from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open sir ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch hey good morning so mike thanks for the details on the cre book i think charlie mentioned that youve gone through loan by loan in identifying and i appreciate the idiosyncratic nature of every sort of cre loan but given the reserve youve taken this quarter give us a sense of your visibility around how well reserved bank is today knowing what we know in terms of the macro outlook and also if you can comment on just the rest of the cre book particularly as it relates to san francisco or california and your level of comfort around just apartments et cetera within that market thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah thanks ill take that its mike broadly ill start on the broader point on cre and then ill come back to office i think weve gone through the multifamily portfolio in quite a lot of detail and i think no im talking about the broader portfolio first and so you talked about apartments in some cities and so i think when you look at the broader portfolio including multifamily its all performing quite well and i think youve seen certainly a slowing of growth rates in rent but theyre not declining in most cases youre seeing good occupancy rates in many of the new construction thats coming online and so overall it feels quite constructive still for multifamily and that same theme really applies to the rest of the portfolio wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 on office thats the place where were certainly seeing weakness and as you think about the allowance we put up we do have some very specific borrower loan level estimates of what we think could play out over the next quarter next few quarters and thats embedded in the allowance and then as you look at the rest of the office portfolio weve gone through a number of stress scenarios and feel like at this point were appropriately reserved to be able to deal with what could be a number of different scenarios depending on how it plays out over time ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch got it and i guess just a separate question you obviously have ample capital just charlie from your standpoint how impactful is the asset cap today given the squeeze on the rest of the industry i would think wells would actually be gaining market share but as the asset cap and regulatory issues im not asking you to give us a timeline but is that still a meaningful challenge in terms of your ability to take market share charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well i mean you can look at the size of our balance sheet and see where it is relative to the asset cap which is ph trillion i think michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co the asset cap yeah charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah thats the actual cap remember which is a daily average over a couple of quarters so relative to where were operating today we feel like we still have plenty of balance sheet to serve our customers and its not standing in the way of that it hasnt always been the case but i think thats where we are today but putting just the pure economics of the asset cap aside it is something that when we look at the work we have to get done the fact that its there is a statement of the reality that we still have more work to do and so its critical that we continue on our road to complete that work and so thats the way were thinking about it today michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and maybe ill just add one thing when you look at some of the growth opportunities we have charlie highlighted some of the investment banking hires were making in large part we already have the exposure out to the client base there so now its about making sure we got the right people to go after the fee opportunity not necessarily extending a lot more balance sheet the wealth management and the growth opportunity there same theme and even in the card space as we look at the refresh product lines doing really well weve got more to come there and i think weve got plenty of room to continue to support many of the growth opportunities we have even if we didnt put out more have more exposure to support it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch good color thank you wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 operator thank you the next question will come from steve chubak of wolfe research your line is open sir steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question just on the nii outlook certainly encouraging to see the guidance increase but you noted mike that it does contemplate a modest level of loan growth and just parsing some of your other comments where you alluded to credit tightening signs of slowdown in the broader economy what gives you confidence around some inflection in lending activity especially given the flattish loan growth that weve seen this quarter michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah well i think were certainly seeing growth in cards so i think we would expect that to continue and then in the rest of the portfolios we see a little bit of growth in the assetbased lending and leasing business in the commercial bank middle market is kind of flat at least this quarter and then you can see the consumer items so i think were hopeful that well see some growth as we go in the second quarter but as always steve what we try to do with guidance is give you guidance that doesnt necessarily require every assumption to go in our favor so the bigger drivers of uncertainty around nii for the rest of the year continue to be the same ones that weve been talking about now for the last couple quarters its really going to be deposits and deposit pricing the loan story will matter but not anywhere near to the same degree steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no its helpful color and just to follow up on expense you cited the head count reductions and higher severance cost driving some upward pressure this year but just wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the exit rate on expense once the head count actions that youd cited are fully captured in the run rate and whether theres any plans to maybe redeploy some of the nii windfall to reinvest back in the business as we think about some of the potential benefits in the higher nii guidance you cited michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think our focus on expenses really hasnt changed over the last quarter or two as we talked about now for a while were going to continue to be very disciplined around the expense base i think were very much focused on making sure we execute and achieve the efficiencies that weve talked about and as we get to yearend well sort of look at and after we do our work around the budget for next year well go back through all the ups and downs like we normally do and give you some perspective there but really the thinking around it hasnt changed wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and let me just add steve if its okay i think when we laid out our expense guidance we got a series of questions about how we think of the variability of that number and the environment and will the rest of our results impact that number and i think as we look at how were performing i think it wouldnt be hard for us to make a bunch of decisions to hit an expense number but the point is our results have been relatively strong and so we are doing a series of things i dont think about it as onetime expenses but there is a fair amount of subjective expenses that relate to business development product enhancements and things like that that we do have the ability to each year each quarter look at how were performing and decide how much we want to spend and so as we look forward i think were going to wait and see as we go through our budgeting process and we do a series of scenarios in terms of how things can play out next year and then make that determination but as mike said i think we do separate out the fact that we continue to believe that there are continued opportunities to drive efficiency throughout the company were not going to lose sight of that and that is separate from how much do we want to spend away from that and well talk more about that towards the end of the year steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions operator thank you the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open sir john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning want to see if we can get some of your updated thoughts on buybacks here cet1 of and you indicated the billion buyback in when you expect to continue to buyback from here but obviously basel iii end game is a factor and i heard that youre contemplating buybacks as you look out from here so can you maybe help frame that for us what that could mean in terms of the pace of repurchases thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co not really anymore than i think what we said is as much clarity as we want to give it this time i think we have substantial excess capital above the regulatory requirements and regulatory buffers and on top of the level of buffers that we have talked about running at and so we think thats prudent given the fact that its likely that capital requirements are going up but the reality to answer the just in terms of the timing and in terms of the ability to answer the question from everything that we read is the same thing that you read its likely that we will learn later this month or early next month exactly what the proposal is and based upon that it will help us inform exactly how much room we have for buybacks but in most of the scenarios that we see there is room for us to continue the buyback program in a prudent way and still build required capital for whatever levels we have to be required to build them at and keep the kind of buffers that we want to keep so there are a bunch of moving pieces here and so it just doesnt make sense to put any more numbers on it till we actually see what those proposals are john pancari q analyst evercore isi wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 okay thank you thats helpful and then separately on the nii side again appreciate the updated guide for the maybe can you talk about when you look at the forward curve what could be the forward curve implications for nii as you look further out into if we do reach a fed fund of around implied by the forward curve how much of a headwind to nii could that be for you and maybe also if you could just talk about the nearterm deposit trajectory i know you mentioned still continued decline so i dont know if you can help frame that and size it up thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah john im not going to give you much clarity on but i think the things you should think about obviously are going to be as rate on the commercial side rate betas on the way up are pretty high betas on the way down are pretty high and the consumer side really hasnt moved much at this point and so you sort of have to go into your modeling looking at each of the components a little bit differently and as we and i think many others have talked about over time like once rates peak theres likely some lag of continued repricing for a while after rates peak and so youve got to think about all of how that goes in your model and then i think as i said in my script i think weve seen pretty consistent performance across deposits over the last couple of quarters and were not seeing big shifts in behavior at this point and so well see how that goes over the coming quarters but theres still a lot of uncertainty in the assumptions that you go through that you have here and so youve got to make your best judgment on what you think is going to happen but as you get closer to the end of the rate cycle you have probably seen a lot of the mix shift and repricing happening already but well see how it goes charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and can i just add john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you yeah charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co just even just more broadly just to be clear about it we dont were not looking specifically at giving guidance in terms of yet but at the same time just more broadly speaking we are and have been out earning in nii and weve been very clear about that as we talk about getting towards our rotce targets its in a more normalized environment but at the same time there are a series of things that we expect to be able to do as we look forward a big part of it is growing the fees in the business as mike spoke about were not constrained by the asset cap theyre in our existing businesses and a lot of the things that were doing whether its in our wealth business whether its in the card business whether its in the corporate and investment bank or middle market as well we do expect to see the fruits of that labor at the same time we continue to stay very focused on expenses and then the other thing i would just remind everyone is theres lots of conversations around chargeoffs and things like that but remember we are all required when we think about cecl to be as forward looking as we possibly can you all know how we come up with the different scenarios and so the level of reserving thats been running through our pl i think this is the fifth consecutive quarter weve added to reserving which is whats wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 impacting the eps of the company has been based upon an environment which at some point will be very different than what the expectation is sitting here so i think you add all those things together and i just think its important you think about all those things as opposed to just nii itself next question operator operator certainly well move on to betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just two followups one on the reserve build in commercial real estate that i know you discussed a bit already i just wanted to understand how much of that was coming from really california we all know there was a property that traded on california street that sold at a discount so im just wondering how much of it is california office versus anything more broader based beyond that thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah betsy its not isolated to california i think you see weakness in a lot of cities these days and it really comes down to propertyspecific stuff and even in california weve got as many examples where clients are actually reinvesting in buildings even if lease rates are low or even empty in some cases as they are going into a workout so i think it really depends on building borrower and all the things which we had talked about in the script and its less focused on just california charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and i just want to reemphasize what mike is saying and we talked about this in the prepared remarks which is we have all spent a bunch of time going through a very detailed review of the office portfolio just the other day we went through just a whole series of things that were seeing and i just really want to make the point which i said in my script its not its a very big mistake to think about loss content by looking at just where the property is again we have examples in cities that are struggling where the structure of our loan is quite good the underlying property has very high lease rates for an extended period of time and then we can have a loan in a market which is doing well but for whatever reason that property theres specific issue in that property there are a bunch of potential termination dates in the shorter term and so thats the level of detail that we have used to look at to come up with what we think the appropriate level of reserving is and i think weve tried to be as diligent as we can in stressing the scenarios that we see play itself out so that when we look at ourselves and we understand what cecl reserving requires us to do thats what were trying to accomplish wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so would you i think we all know like for the most part commercial real estate loans are bullets where the stress comes at the roll and i guess im wondering is this reserve add reflecting the entirety of the cre book for that entirety of roll rate risk or is this like a twoyear forward and part of the reason for asking the question is trying to understand if theres how much risk there is for further increases in cre related reserve builds charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah mike ill start and then you either chime in or give your opinion we have tried to take into account all of the risks including refinance risks that exist in the portfolios looking at the current rate environment cap rate expectations and things like that is it possible that we have to add something in the future because we learn more as time goes on we would never say no but again what were trying to do is be holistic in the review of the portfolio based upon everything that we know and just as you can imagine when we sit in the room with the people that run the real estate business and all the risk people theres a range of opinions there are people in there that say we just its hard to see losing this amount of money based upon what that individual thinks all of the underlying assumptions will play themselves out as and then there are others where we say we actually want to stress the scenario because it is possible and we have to give weighting to that and so thats how we come up with what this is but again were trying to again just were trying to be forward looking were trying to be holistic in all the risks that exist and part of the reason to show you those that additional disclosure we made is so you can see exactly where the issues are relative to the rest of the office portfolio and the rest of cre and isolate just the level of reserving that exists which is at this point is substantial betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it i understand thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay operator thank you the next question will come from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning guys mike can you share with us you touched on this a little bit the response to one of the earlier questions but when you guys are looking at your balance sheet and youre measuring your treasury functions on your assets and liabilities can you share with us what youre thinking for the second half of the year or into next year in terms of how youre managing that and how that may be different than what how you positioned the balance sheet a year ago michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 yeah gerard sure its not that different on the margin you may be making decisions to add a little duration here or there but id say its marginal at this point and we really havent changed substantially how the balance sheet is positioned gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just to follow up i know you guys have given some good details here on working through the commercial real estate portfolio and mike i think you said in your prepared remarks in some cases youve been able to get additional payments or equity investments from your borrowers to cure maybe a potential problem can you share with us some of the other workout solutions youre using so you can get through this period of adjust just were seeing in commercial real estate michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean sure theres plenty of little structural enhancements you can make to feel better about it and then youre also in a lot of cases getting some partial paydowns and then you look at and youre trading those for refinancing term and i think you give people a little bit more time to work through the sets of issues i think we try really hard not to punt issues down the road and so if there are real issues that we need to deal with we try to deal with them in the moment but there are a number of structural enhancements that we work on with borrows to get ourselves comfortable that were setting the loan up for success gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator thank you the next question will come from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask a question on how youre interpreting the occ and fed joint statement that they put out on june encouraging lenders to sign shortterm or temporary loan accommodation solutions with their borrowers is that really anything new is that just standard operating procedure that theyre reiterating or can this sort of help provide a solution set that would allow you to work with your borrowers and perhaps delay a classification deterioration of classification or a classification to tdr michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah its mike ill take that well tdr doesnt exist anymore that classification but the guidance is very similar to what was issued originally back i think in it hasnt really changed much and doesnt really change the way weve been interacting with our borrowers already in terms of really being proactive to work with them to find solutions to help them work through what could be difficult circumstances in some cases and it doesnt give you any leeway for how you classify criticized loans or other classifications so the intent is really to just be clear that people should continue to work with borrowers to find solutions which is what we do all the time anyway erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 got it and just a followup question here thank you for the disclosure again on slide with billion of your loans in cib i think investors are wondering what is the average loan size there michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i dont think thats something we give and theres a wide range averages sometimes are very misleading so theres a wide range and what really matters is not the loan size it really matters what really matters is all the variables charlie talked about earlier in terms of whats happening with that property so i think that would be i think i would focus there erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just squeezing in one more question and before i ask this expense question charlie i think your investors very much appreciate it that youre not just doing whatever you can to hit an expense number and youre reinvesting back into the company so to that end im wondering if have you disclosed how much of the million increase in the outlook for this year has to do with severance michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co we didnt give an exact number but that is by far the single largest piece of it thats part of it and there are some other exit costs for properties as we exit some lease space and other things but that the severance is by far the largest piece erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thank you operator thank you the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i want to follow up charlie on some of your prepared remarks you talked about theres still some things that youre implementing to address regulatory issues im wondering if you could give a couple examples of what still needs to be done in terms of implementation and when you expect that to be completed charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i think as weve said theres a lot of work to do it is multi years worth of deliverables what ive said is that we have implemented a lot but we still have more to do and when i say that i just want to be clear everyone generally thinks im speaking about one of the consent orders which has the asset cap were thinking about all of the work that we have to do related to all the consent orders and the work to build the control environment and there is a lot getting done wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 but ultimately what matters you dont get an a for effort in this its about getting things over the finish line on time and getting them done with the quality that our regulators and we expect from each other and so as you know weve been very careful not to put dates out there because we have to do our work and then our regulators have to take a look at it and see if its done to their satisfaction we dont want to get ahead of that process but we continue to move forward matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i understand that you cant speak for them signing off on what youve done but in terms of you accomplishing what you want to accomplish where are you on that kind of process like whether you want to frame it from an innings perspective or percent basis any way to frame that acknowledging theres a lot to do and that youve done a lot but how far along are you in terms of what you can control on implementing these things charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah now listen i appreciate your desire to have me answer those questions but again all that matters our view of accomplishing the work doesnt matter what matters is that our regulators look at it and say its done to their satisfaction so i really dont think its helpful or productive to go beyond what ive said at this point but again i do understand and appreciate why youre asking matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood and fair enough thank you operator thank you the next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks a quick one mike or charlie can you give us the maturity schedule what percentage or amount of your office cre loans are maturing in the second half and into michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co not specifically vivek we dont disclose that but you should assume these are standard course loans in the commercial real estate space which are generally three to fiveyear loans vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and you havent really been originating much in the last couple of years so i guess we could go back to looking at when did you slow down the origination of new office cre mike was it two years ago was it three any color on that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 yeah look i think you have to remember that weve been refinancing existing facilities along that time period but i think if you take the portfolio and assume some kind of basic average life based on what i said i think youll get a pretty good sense of the approximate maturity schedule vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and how about multifamily whats the average life of those loans and maturities there i heard your comments that those are in much better position given all the factors you already cited michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co slightly longer a few years longer than office vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thank you operator and our final question for todays call will come from charles peabody of portales partners your line is open sir charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut good morning most of my questions were already asked and answered but i wanted to follow up on the consent order issues if i recall correctly and please correct me if im wrong there is six consent orders remaining and three of them if i remember deal somewhat with the mortgage banking operation and i know starting last fall you started the planning effort to simplify and downsize that and youve been executing on that this year can you give us a sense of what it is you need to do in mortgage banking related to those consent orders michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah charles this is mike so first of all there are nine public consent orders out there that are all there so you can see those but when you look at the mortgage ones i think that each of the consent orders is actually quite clear in terms of what needs to happen to satisfy those so i would just point you back to the documents themselves which can give you a pretty good sense of what it is and each one is a little bit different charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut a followup then do you talk to the regulators about the progress youre making in mortgage banking on a monthly basis or quarterly basis semiannual or do you present something at the end how does the interaction with the regulators go michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co we talk to our regulators all the time at all parts of the company at all levels of the company and so you should assume were actively engaged consistently with our regulators all the time wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co but the only thing i would add to that is theyre here theyre onsite we talk to them literally all the time charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut right no i understand that but specifically related to the progress youre making charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co no i know just give me a second we talk to them about everything and given the importance of the consent orders you can assume its about the work thats going on in the underlying consent order but having said all of that what matters is the work that they do at the end of the consent order after we submit it to them and so they can be up to speed on what were doing they can know how we feel about the progress that were making but when we submit a consent order to them they come in and do their holistic review and so thats really where their determination is made about whether or not its done to their satisfaction so again that just gets to the reason why i want to be very careful about not drawing any conclusions from our view on our work or any interim comments we might get from them what really matters is the holistic review that they do and the process that they go through internally in the regulatory organizations charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut so that was part of my first question have you submitted anything yet on mortgage banking charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co were not going to talk about that i said that over and over and over again charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut all right thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thank you very much everyone we appreciate the time and well talk to you all soon operator thank you all for your participation on todays
