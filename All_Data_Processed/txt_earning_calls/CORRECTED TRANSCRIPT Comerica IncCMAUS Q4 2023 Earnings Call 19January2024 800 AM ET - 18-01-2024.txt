chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you kelly and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call although was challenging for our industry we felt it was a year of achievement following industry disruption we protected relationships stabilized deposits maintained strong credit quality enhanced our capital and took steps to position our business for future success in fact we delivered record average loans and record net interest income despite the marketplace instability we advanced key strategic initiatives and received impressive recognition for our results small business to highlight as we initiated a national expansion effort delivered awardwinning products and achieved our threeyear lending goal ahead of schedule noninterest income remained a priority as we launched targeted initiatives aimed at enhancing our products and increasing our mix of capital efficient income although the economic environment remains uncertain we observed a cautiously more optimistic trend in customer sentiment at year end as we believe many expect less rate pressure in we remain committed to supporting our customers and feel we are positioned to grow alongside them as the economy strengthens comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 full year financial highlights are on slide with growth we produced our highest level of average annual loans despite the impact of deliberate optimization efforts in the second half of the year deposits remained a targeted focus and we were pleased to see stabilization following the industry events and ongoing quantitative tightening we delivered record net interest income aided by higher rates and loan balances credit quality remained strong with net chargeoffs well below historical averages in all it was a strong quarter for the company and we ended with a good fourth quarter since there were a number of notable items in this quarters results im going to hand the call to jim to discuss those upfront and provide context for the remainder of the presentation jim james j herzog chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone slide details the notable items curt referenced most of which were furnished in an 8k earlier this month as previously announced we recorded million in noninterest expenses related to the onetime special fdic assessment this was unchanged from indications provided in our december update next was the accounting impact from the pending cessation of bsby since approximately billion of our swap portfolio was designated to bsby loans the announcement impacted our ability to maintain hedge accounting for that portion of the portfolio and resulted in a net noncash loss of million the key message is that cessation does not result in an economic impact only a change in the time recognition of earnings these recognized losses will accrete back and the normal course pay received cash settlements and earnings recognition on the swaps remain uninterrupted while the realization of losses flowed through to our regulatory capital ratios they did not further impact tangible common equity or tangible book value also note operationally and from a customer perspective we feel well prepared for a seamless transition third in the list were million in severance charges which elevated fourth quarter noninterest expenses and were intended to enhance future earnings power and create capacity for investment we previously signaled such efforts were being considered and we will discuss them in more detail later in the presentation the last item does not impact bottom line results but created line item geography changes within our income statement the finalization of our agreement with ameriprise to serve as our new investment platform provider caused a decline in noninterest income offsetting a decline in noninterest expenses while relatively small impact in late we noted here because we expect a larger impact in slide summarizes our fourth quarter results overall the quarter performed in line with expectations excluding notable items considering the impact of those items im going to move to the individual line item slides to discuss quarterly results in more detail turning to slide our intentional balance sheet management reduced average loans and commitments in the fourth quarter the exit of mortgage banker finance contributed to almost half of the reduction in average balances at year end approximately million in loans remained in that business muted customer demand due to elevated rates impacted general middle market balances while increased selectivity prioritizing for relationships and higher returns reduced loans in equity fund services and corporate banking ongoing funding of multifamily and industrial construction projects continued to drive higher commercial real estate utilization but commitments declined for the second consecutive quarter as we strategically managed comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 pipeline and originations the floating rate nature of our commercial loan portfolio benefited from higher rates as loan yields continued to climb to in the fourth quarter slide highlights the stability of our deposit base average deposit balances remained relatively flat to the third quarter at billion even with declines of million in brokered time deposits and million related to the exit of mortgage banker finance growth in general middle market and corporate banking reflects seasonal patterns while retail benefited modestly from promotional campaigns declines in national dealer services deposits were attributed to operations consistent with inventory and utilization trends observed in that business noninterestbearing balances performed in line with expectations and the pace of decline continued to flatten ongoing success in growing interestbearing deposits grew up to over noninterestbearing deposit mix which we continue to view as a competitive advantage industry competition the rate environment and successful promotional campaigns drove deposit costs higher to basis points resulting in a cumulative beta of in the fourth quarter our deposit profile has historically been a strength and with our favorable mix operating nature of our accounts and uninsured trends we feel it is even more compelling as shown on slide we continue to normalize our liquidity position using excess cash to repay wholesale funding while retaining significant capacity we absorbed billion in maturing fhlb advances and allowed over million in brokered time deposits to mature in the quarter we expect decisions on future wholesale funding maturities to follow the normal course monitoring of balance sheet dynamics and funding needs at our loantodeposit ratio remained favorable and positions us to prioritize high return loan growth going forward periodend balances in our securities portfolio on slide increased approximately million as paydowns and maturities were more than offset by a million positive marktomarket adjustment from rate movements late in the quarter treasury maturities and anticipated securities repayments are projected to benefit net interest income and aoci and we anticipate a improvement in unrealized securities losses over the next two years turning to slide net interest income decreased million to million driven by higher rates and deposit mix as volume changes related to loans deposits and wholesale funding were largely offset by lower balances at the fed successful execution of our balance sheet optimization strategy has allowed us to reduce wholesale funding and enhance margin as shown on slide successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet positions us favorably for a gradual basis points or basis points on average decline in interest rates of note bsby cessation did not impact the ongoing cash flow associated with their swaps listed on the slide while we took a loss in the fourth quarter we will accrete that loss back with the majority coming back into net interest income in and we expect the impact in to be relatively muted although there may be some marktomarket volatility until we fully redesignate remaining impacted swaps to sofr by strategically managing our swap and securities portfolio while considering balance sheet dynamics we intend to maintain our insulated position over time credit quality remains strong as highlighted on slide modest net chargeoffs of basis points remain below our normal range and the few we had were more concentrated in relatively higher risk portfolios we observed some normalization in general middle market and corporate banking as rates pressured customer profitability these normalization trends drove the slight increase in the allowance for credit losses to of total loans nonperforming assets increased but still remained historically low overall our portfolio continued to perform as expected and we believe migration will remain manageable comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 on slide fourth quarter noninterest income of million included million in notable items excluding the impact of these items and an increase in deferred compensation which was offset in expenses noninterest income performed in line with guidance while we continue to expect noncustomer income in to come down from elevated levels we remain committed to investments to drive capital efficient fee growth over time expenses on slide included million in notable items beyond those items increases in salaries and benefits reflected the impact of higher deferred compensation offset within noninterest income increased consulting expenses are attributed to advancing strategic and risk management initiatives and a smaller gain on the sale of real estate in the fourth quarter had the net impact of increasing expenses moving to slide we previously communicated an intention to address growing expense pressures and the structural impact to industry profitability from events in addition to our normal efficiency efforts this slide details incremental actions to recalibrate expenses in support of investments and enhanced earnings through this process we are prioritizing customers and positioning the business for future success complementing efforts already underway to rationalize real estate we initiated a plan to further reduce our physical footprint including the closure of banking centers where we assessed nominal customer impact in order to enhance colleague efficiency and keep decision makers close to our customers we are streamlining our management structure and eliminating select roles when combined with the impact of banking center closures these actions eliminated approximately positions further we are optimizing our product offering to enhance capital efficiency and returns and select contracts are being reviewed for renegotiation in total these actions have the effect of reducing expected expenses by million growing to an estimated benefit of million in these decisions are challenging and we do not take them lightly but we feel they are necessary to support the sustainable growth of our business slide highlights our solid capital position even with the impact of notable items our estimated cet1 grew to rate movement coupled with continuous paydowns and maturities in our securities portfolio reduced losses within aoci and increased tangible common equity to based on the december forward curve we expect our unrealized losses to reduce by onethird by the end of although the proposed capital changes do not apply to us based on our asset size we favor a conservative approach to capital management and plan to monitor ongoing aoci volatility and regulations as they evolve our outlook for is on slide we project full year average loans to decline to impacted by optimization trends late in while we expect some impact of selectivity to continue into the first quarter we anticipate loan growth from decembertodecember with contributions from almost all businesses full year average deposits are expected to be down to from but we project relative stability pointtopoint following a seasonal decline in the first quarter we expect customer deposits to stabilize and rebound in the second half of the year based on the forward curve we expect full year net interest income to decline from driven largely by yearoveryear deposit mix we expect deposit seasonality and to a lesser extent less income from bsby redesignation slightly higher deposit betas and lower loan balances to impact first quarter net interest income from there we expect a small uptick in the second quarter and more pronounced growth in the second half of the year as it relates to bsby hedge accounting interest rates and timing of redesignation could create volatility but we expect to eliminate most or all of that potential volatility from transition of indexes by the end of the first quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 credit quality remains strong and we expect continued migration to be manageable we forecast full year net chargeoffs to move into the lower half of our normal to basis point range we expect noninterest income to grow on a reported basis which would be relatively flat yeartoyear when adjusting for notable items as we signaled last quarter we expect fhlb dividends price alignment income from hedges and boli to decline from elevated levels customer income is expected to increase modestly with growth in fiduciary and capital markets and deposit service charges partially offset by pressures in card commercial lending fees and the assumption that favorable marktomarket derivative adjustments do not repeat full year noninterest expenses are expected to decline on a reported basis but grow after adjusting for notable items through successful execution of our expense recalibration efforts we believe we have created capacity to prioritize investments designed to further enhance our funding base revenue mix and capital efficiency as well as risk management framework even with projected pointtopoint loan growth we expect to maintain capital well in excess of our target we will continue to monitor aoci volatility and the evolving regulatory environment as we evaluate the right time to resume share repurchases in all we are proud of our year and we feel weve taken the right actions to support the future of our business now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim despite the industry volatility in we think it is important to take a step back and reinforce that our core business remained unchanged as shown on slide as a leading bank for business with strong wealth management and retail capabilities our tenured colleagues deliver valueadded expertise to our impressive customer base our highly regarded approach to credit continue to perform well and has historically outperformed our peers tailored products are designed to meet the needs of our customers enhancing revenue and retention our deposit profile has long been a strength and investments in products and small business are expected to make this core funding source even more compelling actions to recalibrate our expense base are designed to benefit our future and at well over strategic capital target we believe we have a strong foundation in august we will celebrate our 175th anniversary you do not achieve that kind of longevity without proving time and time again that you can successfully navigate disruptions in our motto proved resilient our colleagues rallied to support our customers through an uncertain time and we delivered record results as we look forward into this milestone anniversary year for our company im confident in our ability to deliver for our customers colleagues and shareholders we appreciate your time this morning and would be happy to take some questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is coming from peter winter from da davidson your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning good morning so theres been a lot of focus this earnings season on kind of a normalized margin range im just wondering what you as some of these swaps mature what the margin could get back to do you think it could get back to those precovid levels in the range james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning peter as you may know and recall i dont like to get real specific on margin i think this quarter is a great example of that where we actually had a decrease in net interest income but we had an increase in nim so a bank with our business model where you had some lumpiness you can get those correlations that dont match up but i do see nim trending in a very good direction we ticked up this quarter we will have a little bit of a tick down next quarter as the first quarter guidance would imply based on the percentage growth that we put in the outlook but then we see a steady climb from there i do see us by the end of actually getting above where this past fourth quarter was and then we continue to traject up from there throughout as we have swaps and securities roll off and we get into a more normalized environment so i do see a lot of momentum building for us in the second half of this year and i see that momentum actually accelerating as we move through and of course thats exclusive of the bsby hedge accounting impact were actually going to have significant income added to on top of the factors that i just talked about peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks jim and then just to follow up you had really nice growth in the cet1 ratio and even adjusted for aoci youre above the minimum threshold im just wondering you mentioned in the prepared remarks looking at aoci but what are some of the parameters youre looking for to resume share buybacks and then how much capital do you accrete on a quarterly basis james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah peter number one i do think were on a very good track to comply with basel iii endgame rules should they end up applying to us but with that said we do have a little bit of flexibility based on the fact that we are in pretty good shape there the number one thing that i continue to keep an eye on is aoci it did come down significantly this quarter lets keep in mind it came down after a number of quarters being more elevated and comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 then since then rates have ticked back up again so i dont want to declare a victory yet on the aoci front for us as well as the whole industry i mean it looks like things are going in a good direction and were certainly going to be in very solid shape to comply with any capital rules but before we start the share repurchase up again i would put aoci at the top of the list that we want to keep our eye on to make sure that doesnt tick the other direction again a little more line of sight into what the overall economic environment is from an interest rate standpoint and just overall uncertainty standpoint but it does appear we are going to be in shape at some point to start the share repurchase but we want to be cautious and we will be cautious this year certainly in the first half of the year we wont be active in share repurchase well keep our options open in the second half of the year but ill say that even there we will likely be cautious unless we get a better line of sight in terms of interest rates and overall economic stability peter j winter q analyst da davidson co and how much capital do you accrete roughly on a quarterly basis james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc well its going to depend on the quarter and the year and whats going on in the economy i can tell you that in we will likely not accrete a lot of capital maybe a tad bit above where we ended the year but with point topoint growth even though were going to have i think strong earnings next year i dont think youre going to see us significantly above where we ended the fourth quarter but i think as you move into youre going to start seeing some nice accretion from that point on peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thanks jim curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks peter james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you peter operator thank you our next question today is coming from manan gosalia from morgan stanley your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning manan comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to ask on your loantodeposit ratio it ticked down again in the quarter to about i get that youre looking for loan growth pointtopoint next year and you might be bringing in deposits ahead of that but i guess if the loan growth is contingent on rates coming down why pay out for deposits now why not bring in the deposits later as the loan growth comes in and what is the right loantodeposit ratio to consider as we look out into the end of curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc manan this is curt i might start and then ask jim or peter to add in but on the deposit front maybe just to keep the perspective here is that we consider deposits part of full relationships with clients and we have clients for whom we have lending relationships and clients for whom we have deposit relationships and clients for whom we have both but in the case of growing deposits were going to grow deposits sort of in line or taking care of our customers and having lived through what the whole industry lived through last spring i dont believe this is an environment where were going to turn any deposits away for lack of a better definition we do believe that that loantodeposit ratio will go up some but we should be able to comfortably stay within our target we believe kind of in the mid even with the pointtopoint growth that were expecting in james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah two points i would add on to that manan i mean we love deposits and regardless of loans i mean were making money on these deposits were not holding capital on them we love cap we love deposits just for what they represent amongst themselves but having said that we certainly dont want to operate in a justintime funding capacity for loans i mean we want to make sure were prepared for when that loan comes you cant necessarily turn deposits on on a dime but we welcome the deposits were not going to turn them away were making money on them and they continue to add to the stability of the overall franchise manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and maybe a followup there on deposits as rates start to go down given your skew to commercial how should we think about those deposit betas on the way down if we do get the six rate cuts or even more than that as we as we get into do you think the first few rate cuts are more beneficial given your skew to commercial or should you start to see more momentum in deposit costs coming down as you get into rate cut numbers four five and six james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah every cycle is different so its hard to say for sure but i think in this particular cycle we could see a little bit of symmetry or what i might call lifo approach last in first out i mean certainly we saw betas accelerate towards the end of the cycle and even in the last couple of quarters without fed hikes weve seen deposits continue to tick up and so just as weve seen them more accelerated in the second half of the cycle i think those might be the most sensitive deposits that we can take back down early in the following rate cycle comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 so i am somewhat cautiously optimistic we are assuming in the outlook about a beta with not too big of a lag following those rate cut having said that every cycle is different and i do recall back in the fed cut bps i believe in july of and i didnt see a lot of falling rates in the industry overall that was a very controlled environment where the economy was still relatively strong and i continue to think that the reason for the fed cuts is really going to drive that beta if its a very orderly take down of rates and the economy continues to be very strong it may be a little stickier to bring them down but if the fed reduces rates because there is a little weakening in the economy i think that gets banks a little bit more leverage so i would just emphasize that every cycle is different but we do think there is that potential for some significant beta in those first few cuts manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and do you have what percentage of your deposits are directly indexed to the fed funds rate james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc most of our deposits are not were very much a relationshipbased bank and many of those are oneonone conversations with customers so we do have some reciprocal deposits that are considered to be somewhat indexed obviously the brokered deposits their time deposits are somewhat indexed you could consider but the vast majority of our deposits are not manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator thank you next question is coming from john pancari from evercore isi your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning good morning first question just around the loan growth expectation the pointtopoint expectation could you give us a little bit of color where do you see the loan growth drivers coming from and when do you really see an acceleration there in overall loan growth as you look through thank you peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc john this is peter so its actually pretty broad based i mean we mentioned this morning we still have a little bit of mortgage banker finance at the end of december that will be working against us a little bit through the year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 but then across the rest of our businesses its pretty broad based i do think i think dealer probably has sort of momentum going into thatll continue throughout the year our efs business i think is a business that if you kind of look in the appendix weve shown has dropped a couple of quarters i think itll probably drop first quarter but we think itll pick up quite a bit going into but really broad based across middle market we feel like weve got some really good momentum i would tell you that we feel like customer sentiment changed a little bit in the fourth quarter in the right direction and sort of our informal surveys that we do internally with everything seems to indicate that theres going to be some more demand as we get into what i would really say the second quarter to answer your question probably second third quarter is where i think well start to see that pick up as we talk about today our outlook on first quarter is pretty flat to down a little bit but i think as we get into the middle of the year were getting indications that well start to see some real good loan growth that results in that pointtopoint john pancari q analyst evercore isi great okay thank you thats helpful and then separately your guidance implies call it ballpark about basis points or so of core negative operating leverage based upon the midpoints of the guide and im just wondering if the revenue picture ends up being more pressured than you currently forecast do you have expense flexibility to improve that operating leverage i know you set out the million in expense reduction from the recalibration in can that recalibration benefit that million can that go up if revenue is pressured to a greater degree thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc john as jim said in his prepared remarks that million becomes million on a run rate basis in and this is an interesting period of time the whole industry has gone through an inflection in and somewhat of a recalibration to use your words weve tried to be thoughtful in terms of balancing the things that we believe are driving revenue for us and will drive revenue for us going forward that includes some of the products that weve invested in especially in treasury management payments capital markets wealth management it also includes the focus on small business expansion into new markets into the southeast and into the mountain west colorado region and so we want to stay focused on those because were trying to really play the long game here and try to get beyond sort of the immediate environment that were operating in and then secondly i would say while we did have some expense initiatives in the quarter were always thinking about additional efficiency opportunities and again its all about sort of balancing between those two and so my hope is that we would see positive operating leverage really based on overall revenue growth and a return to a more normalized interest rate environment and hopefully a soft landing on the economy and a lack of further credit deterioration et cetera if we dont see that then obviously we need to think about what else we can do from an efficiency standpoint john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right thank you and just regarding that when do you expect you could break into more of a positive operating leverage trajectory comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah john its jim i mean number one just to build on curts comments i do think is a bit of a transition year not just for us but for the whole industry i think youre hearing that from some of the other calls too were in this kind of tweener stage where interest rates continue or pay rates and deposits continue to edge up a little bit yet the fed isnt raising rates so that makes it a really challenging year i do think things will start to move in the positive operating leverage direction in we dont have a complete line of sight into that yet but i mentioned how we expect net interest income to really have some great momentum as we enter into and of course thats always the goal to have a positive operating leverage and on the topic of expenses ill just add that i think that really is a journey not a destination we always have to be looking at expenses i dont think this will be the end of taking a really hard look at what we can do over time and i think if expense reduction is really having a purpose for twofold one is to create capacity for investment which continues to be critically important probably more so now than ever and then secondly to make sure we get that positive operating leverage so we will continue to kind of keep an eye on not just normal budget hygiene but actually seeing what more significant steps we can take over time so as i said a journey not a destination and i think should have things moving in the better direction but again not a complete line of sight into that john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks jim curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question is coming from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now live jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning question on your net interest income guide what kind of rate assumptions do you have in that and any kind of rate scenario that you think derails that from what youre thinking today comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning jon yeah we did assume the forward curve which has almost six rate cuts in it youll notice on our asset sensitivity page that for the first time that i can recall at least we became liability sensitive so i think this is a very fortuitous time for us to become liability sensitive with potentially six rate cuts out into the future we do have the sensitivities there using a beta you can see that we do benefit from falling rates assuming that we can reprice as expected without too much of a lag so i would say if we get fewer cuts than that that will put a little pressure on that outlook but we are benefiting from the curve if we really do get those six cuts so thats the assumption and well continue to monitor and well see where the economy and where the fomc goes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah a lot going on this morning i had to rub my eyes when i saw that slide i guess one of my followup questions and maybe you answered it is do you still consider yourself asset sensitive and i guess the answer is no at this point james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thats what our models would say you never know how customers are going to react and the competition is going to react but i would say we are a little more liability sensitive than we are asset sensitive now that liability sensitive could have a little bit more of a lag in it than what were projecting we just dont know how customers and competition will react but over the course of time it does appear that we are a little more liability sensitive jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay a point of clarification on your expense piece of it is it million in and an incremental million in or an incremental million in james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc incremental million jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good and then one melinda i thought youd get a pass but i just wanted to ask one credit question melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc sure jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc on slide that bottom right corner where you show the percent criticized in tls leveraged then auto comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc curious how elevated is that relative to normal i dont know if there is a normal but how elevated is that and what does it take for those to come back down melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah thanks for the question i mean not surprisingly but a positive surprise this quarter was that we actually saw improvement in three of the four incremental monitoring portfolios so we saw balances and criticized assets go down in tls leveraged and automotive production i would say that that leverage portfolio at to is about normal that is an elevated higher risk portfolio by its very design tls again is going to be elevated above the normal portfolio at i would say thats still above sort of historical norm but we are seeing positive momentum in tls certainly the rate environment if it cooperates with the forward curve is going to be a real positive for that segment as well as leverage you didnt ask about commercial real estate specifically but we did see that one relatively flat in the fourth quarter so weve got some assets that are moving into the criticized bucket but we also have assets that are moving out of the criticized bucket and they move out when they either pay off or we remargin them and get them back into a conforming state so i feel really good about all of those portfolios that are listed there on the right and would expect that we should again if the rate environment cooperates and we dont see a downturn in the economy that well continue to see these stable to potentially improving towards the back half of the year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats very helpful thank you melinda melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc welcome curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks jon operator thank you next question today is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning so i want to start by going back to your answer to peters question the first question on nim and its funny for all the years ive covered the company i think you were the most asset sensitive and if you look at the historical nim range its literally all over the place and jim what youve done now is youve basically restructured the balance sheet so its fairly neutral even if i look at this basis point gradual at beta its like bp or so benefit to nim so assuming that we get here lets say the forward curve plays out we go to basis points or so of steepness does that imply your nim the new nim for comerica is like right historically i mean a year ago you were indiscernible im trying to figure out like what the hell does the margin look like at this company with this balance sheet in a normal rate environment that has actual steepness to the curve and i know youre basically a margin bank now because youve taken away the asset sensitivity james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc we have bounced around quite a bit over time steven and we didnt necessarily think that was always a great thing i do think stability is important the rate environment is one factor again just the overall construction of the balance sheet and the lumpiness and the amount of cash were carrying or securities were carrying is also a factor and just again our business model creates a little bit more lumpiness in that regard so we would like a little bit more stability as i mentioned in the peters question i do see our trajectory going north of where we ended here and i think well continue to go north as we move through so were above on a normalized basis and i think we are going to have a much more stable nim and net interest income earnings capacity going forward dont necessarily want to give an exact number but it is north of for sure steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay thats helpful but keep in mind thats why generalists dont put their money in regional banks because the ph black box and the manager dont really help shed some light on what expectations are i want to ask on expenses too so you guys are guiding to around operating expense growth in and thats with the benefit of the new initiatives just a big picture view why is expense growth at the company so much higher than other regionals im sure you look at all the other regionals its higher then if we think about if you dont announce another initiative should we expense the growth rate to lift off of thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc many of the expenses that we have in a lot of the investment were making is not ongoing run rate a lot of its more onetime effort to get some of these initiatives up and running whether theyre on the revenue side the product side or the risk management framework side so i wouldnt necessarily assume that the expenses that we are incurring in all carry over to but we are in an investment mode i mean i think we may be underinvested in certain years if you go back historically so i do think theres a little bit of catch up going on but we are committed to make sure that we can compete in the years going forward and we do think a certain amount of investment is required there and we feel comfortable its going to pay off comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc can you expand on that jim like where did you underinvest and where are you catching up now james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc well i would say number one some of it is just moving with the times with the digitization and some of the online capabilities but i would also say that whether itd be risk management framework or some of the product innovation i just dont think we necessarily always invested as much as we could have historically and rather than trailing on that front wed rather be leading so we think the easier thing to do would be to hunker down and to starve the company and thats not something we want to do so we feel like were doing the right thing and we do feel like its going to pay off with positive operating leverage as we move forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it indiscernible curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc steve this is curt i just would add that as i said earlier we are focused on top line revenue growth we believe we have opportunities on both the fee income side and with the loan portfolio but certainly if we do not see growth materializing if the economy does not move in the right direction if interest rates dont move in the right direction allowing us to get some relief on deposit betas et cetera then well continue to look at expense opportunities id also add that part of this from a risk framework standpoint is continued investment in preparation for potentially being over billion or if basel iii requirements step down to banks sub100 billion kind of in our category at billion steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steve operator thank you next question is coming from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now live curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 operator perhaps your phone is on mute chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry about that good morning sorry about that on the expenses jim i think youve talked historically about roughly million for the billion rule as you kind of know them today can you remind us how much youve accrued is in the guide for related to that james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc i would say we have a small portion of that in the guide for the vast majority of that billion sic million is probably more likely to be in future years as we get closer to billion but there are several million dollars in there as we really try to address those things category iv that we think have a longer runway to get ready for so those items that we think would take say two three four years to really be ready were getting those things in motion now the majority of the category iv requirements we either already have or if we dont have them we think we could complete them within one to two years and so were holding off on that so the majority of the million is still out there in the future but we do have some of that in the run rate in and a little bit more in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe one for curt i think the streets got you roughly at a low teens return on tangible common equity in this year and next can you maybe elaborate on how you think of the return potential of this company obviously youve got a much more stable margin over time but youre also balancing some of the investments curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah i wouldnt maybe give a forecast exactly around returns or even multiples on the company but i would say that we believe that based on the comments we made earlier certainly was a disruptive year and a reset for the industry and i think is some recalibration i believe that interest rates are going to come down and when they do i think it will have a positive impact on nii for us and we believe as we said earlier that in the latter half or second half of the year that we will start seeing nii return we think weve got great opportunities on the fee income side and we showed that in and we think weve got good growth opportunities in terms of the loan portfolio and so our goal is to get to positive operating leverage and i believe that we can return at a level thats commensurate with the industry overall or better from a longer term perspective but will be somewhat of a continued inflection year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color operator thank you next question today is coming from brody preston from ubs your line is now live comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc jim i was hoping maybe you could help me nail down the cadence of the kind of bsby swap amortization the accretion and the nii how much of that i think you said most of its in and then in mid2026 but how much of it happens in and then how much happens in and james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning brody yeah we dont have a clear line of sight into that because out of those billion of bsby hedges or hedges dedicated to bsby loans a little less than billion of them are not re designated yet because we have not generated enough sofr loans to redesignate those particular hedges we do expect to have that complete or at least largely complete by the end of the first quarter and i think at that point well actually have a fair amount of certainty as to how it plays out but in general the way it looks right now on the forward curve and this is exclusive of what i offered in the guidance because again theres a lot of uncertainty there there was likely a very somewhat mild negative impact in to the extent there is any kind of negative impact you just accrete that back in later years so again its not an economic loss and then we are very likely to get the vast majority of it back in think of it as maybe north of of that loss accreted back in and then most of the remaining after that would come in brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you thats helpful i guess if i could just ask one fine point just on the first quarter with the re designation should we see something similar to what we saw this quarter maybe not in terms of size but just directionally where theres a negative kind of nonoperating impact to fee income and maybe a small positive impact to nii james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc it really depends on the rate curve thats going to drive it maybe to a lesser extent the timing of when we re designate certainly its going to be a small fraction of what you saw in the fourth quarter and again whatever you do see will simply accrete back in future quarters so i know there wont be any kind of economic surprise there but from an accounting and recognition standpoint there will be a little volatility the first quarter and again well accrete that back in later quarters and likely mostly in but a little bit of volatility in q1 but also a large amount of not complete certainty after q1 also and we can lay out that exact guidance and cadence brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 got it so you dont have the dollar impact for the first quarter an estimate for the dollar impact to nii for the first quarter yet from this from the bsby stuff james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc we dont we need for the dust to settle in terms of just getting the rest of these redesignated and where the rate curves will drive that and again well be made whole ultimately over the next couple of years brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay if i could ask just another one on the nii guide for the year i think you said it was a beta that you were running through the guidance do you happen to have what the noninterestbearing deposit mix thats underlying the guidance is for next year james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah we continue to think that we were going to bottom out in the low or very near and so weve been pretty consistent on that over the last two to three quarters of course a big driver of that isnt so much even just noninterestbearing deposits but where interest bearing goes and we do plan on having great success with interestbearing deposits as it relates to customers on the other hand at some point we probably will pay down some of these brokered deposits that we have because thats really a form of wholesale funding that all banks make some degree of use of so the overall level of interest bearing will of course play some optical games with that percentage but our base case is to be in the low towards nearing that point brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then i did just want to ask on the liability sensitive disclosure could you maybe help me think about the moving parts that make you liability sensitive just because like if i just simply looked at you versus a lot of your peers at whatever it is right now nib and still effectively i think floating rate loans like both of those items might be closer to what id call regional bank kind of average for floating rate loans but the nib is still above average so like i would holistically think about you as being mildly asset sensitive but what are the moving parts elsewhere on the balance sheet that push you towards liability sensitivity james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah thats a good point and we do stick out in a very good way with our high level of noninterestbearing deposits in the mix where we also stand out and because we have that higher level of noninterestbearing deposits we did put more swaps and securities on the book to manage to a more interest neutral position over the last year and thats exactly why we added those hedges and thats whats offering us the protection in a down rate environment brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay so its mostly the hedges then i guess combined with comerica inc cma corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc it is brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible securities balances james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah i mean its the we always look at it holistically between both the hedges we put on in the form of both swaps and securities but thats the balancing xfactor to your equation there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then last one for me was just around the brokered deposits i think the guidance assumes flat brokered deposits moving forward i guess would you look to use the securities maturities kind of exclusively to pay down borrowings or is there opportunity to kind of run off brokered deposits next year even though its not contemplated in the guide james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah i would say the runoff of securities will be used for a combination of funding loan growth and reducing wholesale funding and i think of wholesale funding as both being some of the debt borrowings like fhlb any security maturities we might have or bond maturities we might have and brokered deposit maturities so therell be some mixture that goes on there in terms of the overall formula but i suspect over time and its actually a goal of ours to reduce brokered deposits over time so at some point you will see a reduction there and securities maturities will be one of the inputs to that equation brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks brody operator thank you weve reached the end of our questionandanswer session id like to turn the floor back over to president chairman and chief executive
