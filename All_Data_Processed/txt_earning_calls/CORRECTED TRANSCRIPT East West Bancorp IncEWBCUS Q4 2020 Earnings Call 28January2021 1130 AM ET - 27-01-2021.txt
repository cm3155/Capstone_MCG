new ppp loans totaling over million excluding ppp total loans grew by billion in the fourth quarter this reflects growth in all of our major loan portfolios fourth quarter loan production was broadbased and came from across our various lending teams and branch network diversified by loan product industry geography and property type we think that this lays a strong foundation for the coming years deposit growth was exceptionally strong in as of december total deposits reached a recordhigh of billion growing by annualized from september and by yearoveryear in particular non interestbearing deposit reached a record billion as of december throughout growth in east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 noninterestbearing deposit balances

total ci commitments were billion quarteroverquarter ci loans outstanding exppp grew by annualized fourth quarter ci growth built on the positive momentum in pipelines and commitments that began in the third quarter in we expect ci growth to be stronger in the second half of the year compared with first half as the anticipated postpandemic economic recovery takes hold fourth quarter ci growth was well diversified by industry with notable commitments growth in general manufacturing and wholesale private equity entertainment food related industries and clean energy further diversifying our ci growth was growth from our greater china portfolio which was billion as of december in the fourth quarter loans in the greater china grew by million accelerating from growth of million in the third quarter the utilization rate of loans outstanding to total commitments was as of december essentially unchanged from september moving to slide and which shows essential details of our commercial real estate portfolio total commercial real estate loans were billion as of december quarteroverquarter this portfolio grew by annualized from september presently this is a slower growing performance reflecting our conservative underwriting in the current environment and the lower level of transactions in the market both for new deals and for refinancing we expect to see relatively slower growth from commercial real estate in until the anticipated postpandemic economic recovery gains momentum on slides and we provide details regarding our singlefamily residential loans and home equity lines during the fourth quarter we originated billion of residential mortgage loans an increase of compared with million in the third quarter this was a record quarter of residential mortgage origination

statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start by discussing loans on covidrelated deferral on slide as of december loans on full payment deferral were of total loans down from as of september including loans on partial payment deferral which ph generally are modifications of pi payment to interest only deferred loans totaled million of total loans down from as of september quarteroverquarter loans on covidrelated deferrals decreased by between september and december the largest improvement was in our commercial real estate loan deferrals which decreased by million or since september as of december the deferral rate on cre was down to under deferrals on residential mortgages decreased by in fourth quarter and the deferral rate on residential mortgages was the deferral rate on ci loans continue to be very low turning to slide for a review of our asset quality metrics and slide for a review of our allowance for loan losses along with the decline in covid19related deferrals were very pleased with the across the board improvement in our asset quality metrics this quarter quarteroverquarter our criticized and nonperforming assets declined and related asset quality ratios improved the outlook for an economic recovery continues to strengthen our borrowers have proven to be resilient and adaptable we feel comfortable with the credit risk in our portfolio and believe that credit costs in will be manageable nonperforming assets were basis points of total assets as of december in the amount of million a quarteroverquarter decrease of accruing loans to days past due were million or basis points of total loans as of december a quarteroverquarter decrease of criticized loans were billion as of december or of total loans a quarteroverquarter decrease of from billion as of september or of total loans within that both classified and special mentioned loans declined quarteroverquarter and their respective ratios improved as of december classified loans decreased to of total loans and special mentioned loans decreased to of total loans criticized ci loans were diversified by industry and the criticized commercial real estate loans were likewise diversified by property type the largest concentration within criticized loans either industry or property type remains oil and gas quarteroverquarter criticized cre loans decreased by and criticized ci loans excluding oil and gas decreased by criticized oil and gas loans were million as of december a quarteroverquarter decrease of million or reduction in these loans came from exits paydowns and upgrades oil and gas loan chargeoffs were under million in the fourth quarter the backdrop for the oil and gas borrowers has strengthened with higher commodity pricing and demand on slide we review there were components of our allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses totaled million as of december or of loans held for investment excluding ppp loans compared with million or as of september and compared with million or on day one postcecl east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 yeartodate postday one of cecl we added million to the allowance largely due to the deterioration in the economic forecast due to covid however the economic forecasts have improved in the second half of resulting in modest declines in the required allowance coverage for all of our major loan portfolio classifications if the macroeconomic conditions continue to improve and credit quality holds or improves we expect to see continued reduction in the required allowance ratio during the fourth quarter we reported million in provision for loan losses compared to million in the third quarter the quarteroverquarter increase in the provision was primarily due to fourth quarter loan growth of over billion excluding ppp loans the other ph loan chargeoffs including the improved macroeconomic forecast lower deferral rates on commercial real estate and reductions and adversely graded delinquent and non performing assets lower oil and gas exposure and certain chargeoffs largely offset each other net chargeoffs in the fourth quarter were million a decrease of from million in the third quarter the fourth quarter net charge off ratio was basis points of average loans annualized an improvement of basis points from the third quarter a quarteroverquarter increase in commercial real estate charge offs in the fourth quarter was more than offset by the quarteroverquarter decrease in ci charge offs fourth quarter charge offs from oil and gas loans totaled under million and now moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide in this slide we summarize the key line items of income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides fourth quarter included some nongaap adjustments related to the writeoff of dc solar tax credit investment which added million or per share to earnings fourth quarter amortization of tax credit and other investments included million of recoveries related to dc solar and fourth quarter income tax was elevated by million of tax expense related to dc solar largely as a result of dc solar related items the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was compared with in the third quarter of the effective tax rate for the full year was compared to for ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slide through starting with average balance sheet growth fourth quarter average loan growth of fourth quarter average loan of billion grew by million or linked quarter annualized led by growth in residential mortgage followed by ci loans excluding ppp and commercial real estate fourth quarter average deposit of billion grew by billion or linked quarter annualized driven by very strong growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits which grew at a rate equivalent to annualized all other deposit categories excluding cds ph have also grown with the strong deposit growth we ended the year with an average loan to deposit ratio of average available for sale debt securities increased by almost billion from the third quarter as we deployed some of our cash late in the quarter we also added million to repo assets which did not yet show up in average balances we continue to deploy excess liquidity into afs securities but given the low interest rates and the flat yield curve attractive opportunities are limited in october of we realized our excess liquidity to pay off in full the ppplf which was billion as of september in the second quarter of we have million of fhlb advances maturing at a rate of on slide you can see that fourth quarter net interest income of million increased by million or linkedquarter and the net interest margin of expanded by basis points from the prior quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans and the ppplf fourth quarter adjusted net interest income of million east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 increased by or million quarteroverquarter and fourth quarter adjusted nim of ph compressed by basis point from the third quarter ppp loans interest and deferred fee income was million in the fourth quarter up from million in the third quarter in the third quarter we adjusted the deferred fee income to account for the slower than anticipated forgiveness and pay off of these loans as of december we have million of deferred fees on last years ppp loans left to accrete in plus of course the interest income of on the ppp loans outstanding dominic shared the monthtodate funding of new ppp loans earlier on the call based on that and applications and process we expect to fund approximately million of new ppp loans in generating approximately million of ph growth ppp yield and plus interest the basis point quarteroverquarter increase in the fourth quarter gaap nim breaks down as follows up basis points from a lower cost of deposits a basis points for ph lower ppp income up basis point from repayment of the ppplf partially offset by down basis points from excess liquidity in the form of more lower yielding assets and also down basis points from lower loan and other earning asset yields turning to slide fourth quarter average loan yields of expanded by basis points from last quarter excluding the impact of ppp the fourth quarter adjusted loan yield of contracted by basis point quarter overquarter exhibiting relative stability ph the down in the pricing of our variable rate loan portfolio is behind us in the upperright quadrant we laid out our average loan yield by portfolio as you can see our single family residential mortgage product is the least rate sensitive portfolio and continues to carry attractive yield turning to slide our cost of deposits continue to decline in the fourth quarter as maturing higherrate cds re price to current market rates we expect to continue to reduce our cost of deposits as time deposits mature in the first quarter of reprice lower our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter dropped to basis points down from basis points in the third quarter an improvement of basis points the spot rate of total deposits as of december was basis points monthtodate in january the spot rate is down another ph basis points to basis points our fourth quarter average costs of interestbearing deposits dropped to basis points down from basis points in the third quarter an improvement of basis points the spot rate of interestbearing deposits as of december was basis points monthtodate in january the spot rate is down another basis points to basis points the average cost of cds in the fourth quarter was basis points we have billion cds maturing in the first quarter at a blended rate of the rate paid on originations or renewals of domestic cds in the fourth quarter of was basis points compared to basis points in the third quarter monthtodate in january this rate ticked down to basis points moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the fourth quarter was million compared with million in the third quarter the quarteroverquarter increase was driven by a number of factors including a favorable change in the credit valuation adjustment of interest rate contracts an increase in customer driven foreign exchange transactions and an increase in net gains on sale of sba loans further treasury management fees continued to grow nicely as we grow commercial deposit accounts and transactions moving on to slide fourth quarter noninterest expense was million an increase of linked quarter excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit and tangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the fourth quarter an increase of quarteroverquarter and east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 exceptionally flat yearoveryear the quarteroverquarter change in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased bonus compensation approval and increased oreo expense which was included in other operating expense the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was an improvement from in the third quarter over the past five quarters our efficiency ratio has ranged from to despite operating headwinds from the covid pandemic related economic slowdown and nearzero interest rates and with that ill now review our outlook for on slide for the fullyear we currently expect year overyear loan growth excluding ppp of to for context loan growth excluding ppp was in and annualized for the second half of we expect welldiversified growth in coming from all of our major loan portfolios the diversification of our loan portfolio in terms of loan type industry real estate property and geography allows us to outperform our peers in terms of loan growth yearin yearout yearoveryear adjusted net interest income growth excluding ppp is generally in line with loan growth on a full year basis underpinning our interest rate interest income assumptions is the current forward interest rate curve adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit and investment amortization of to yearover year in the current environment we are focused on net interest income and pretax preprovision income growth provision for credit losses to range between million and million with the loan growth that we expect much further improvement in the economic forecast this provision outlook anticipates that the allowance coverage of loans will continue to modestly reduce from current levels full year effective tax rate of approximately including the impact of tax credit investments there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to timing of tax credits investments placed into service with that i will now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in summary we had a strong finish to a most unprecedented year it has been a challenging year for many and i wish to thank all of our associates for their commitment and dedication to meeting our customers banking needs as i said at the beginning of my remarks we are optimistic about the year ahead including the expected additional government stimulus to rebuild businesses and communities enhanced support for public health and the broader distribution of covid19 vaccine in addition were looking forward to an improvement in the discourse between the us and china which will be constructive for crossborder capital flows and accordingly for our clients business opportunities we have strong capital and liquidity to support balance sheet growth as the economy recovers and we are confident that we will be able to deliver another year of strong financial performance for our shareholders in i would now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess just first question on credit there are two things you can address i guess irene one talk to us about the remaining deferrals both the partial and the full deferrals when is the sunset for these when do they come to an end and separately if you could address your outlook on net chargeoffs as i think about what you talked about reserve potential for sort of reserve release relative to your provisioning guidance so ph if you could address those two irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc sure on the deferrals i think we talked about before earlier in most of the deferrals pi or just the principal were for three months period i would say that the ones that we had that were ph outstanding at yearend some of them giving just the nature and the process of deferrals every three months are a little bit longer term but on average i would say still two to six months is what those deferral terms are on the chargeoff ratios and our expectation for i want to just start by saying if you look at the full year or the fourth quarter for the chargeoff ratios were very low annualized for the fourth quarter basis points full year of so at this point in time i think its realistic to think that it may increase a little bit from these levels but as we look at credit quality as it stands today there is nothing that were really concerned that the chargeoff ratios will increase dramatically ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and just on a separate note maybe dominic when you think about the ci loan growth for the year do you see theres more potential for upside surprise or downside risk to your outlook and just talk to us about any new opportunity that you see on the ci lending front that could be a meaningful growth driver for the bank thank you dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well were always working on an upside surprise but that being said i think that we pretty much look at this year now the fourth quarter is exceptional annualized growth is really accumulation of efforts from the third and east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 the fourth quarter and we kind of like somewhat highlight in the third quarter that we were developing as much stronger pipeline so although ph those loans are getting booked in the fourth quarter so that was exceptional but if we look at the second half of sort of like annualized growth was about for ci so were kind of using that as our current run rate and we feel pretty good about where we are today because we were able to grow in a very diversified direction from industry types product mix and geographic regions including even the greater china region as i mentioned earlier in my remarks that greater china obvious the chinese economy is recover ahead of united states and so we saw positive ci loan growth in hong kong and china in the third quarter annualized growth or ci loan growth in greater china in third quarter and then accelerate in the fourth quarter to annualized growth so we see that all has so good signs and then if we looked at so far domestically from private equity general wholesale manufacturing entertainment clean energy all of these different areas were growing so from that standpoint overall right now we expect them to continue to do well and so hopefully well do better than what we forecast but in terms of downside i guess the downside will be in case i dont know if there is a the vaccine distribution not working well and somehow the execution from the government ph in towards the stimulus plan was not working and so forth and that can potentially sort of like derail some of the customers confidence to invest or to grow the business that can potentially happen but i looked at the current administration it looks like we have all very seasoned veterans that are managing the best they can i have i think a higher confidence at this point that theres higher likelihood that they will be able to get the economy turned around in the second half of the year operator our next question will come from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks my first question just in terms of your nii guidance that is going to generally be in line with loan growth your loan growth comments that you said obviously that loan growth picks up in the back half of the year should we expect the nii to follow that same trend like that it stays relatively flat in first half and then accelerates in back half for an average of lets call it to would love any commentary thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc ken so our guidance is endofperiod loan growth of to so with the nii obviously following the average loan growth for the year i think in general probably when you will get that maybe on the lower end of that to and probably what makes sense from that calculation ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay yeah i was thinking actually end of period that totally makes sense and then just separate question in terms of your cecl day one reserve i think it was about basis points but i could be wrong is that still a good target postpandemic of where you might want to be given your current loan mix east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah certainly as you know its very complex calculation so i cant comment on necessarily where i think its going to end up but i would confidently say as economy recovers as a credit quality continues to improve that i believe theres certainly room to lower that allowance from the levels we are today ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thanks ken operator our next question comes from michael young with truist securities please go ahead michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question and preemptive congratulations on the year of the ox i hope its better than the year of the rat wanted to ask ph just literally on the chargeoff this quarter and maybe what you see coming through the pipe i know generally you guys went to very low loan to value on commercial real estate so kind of just curious whats causing the actual chargeoffs in those buckets irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so the chargeoffs for cre in the quarter we obviously especially with the pandemic and the environment there are some loans that were working through so these have been kind of problem nonperforming loans for a while and depending on kind of looking at where the cash flows are and valuations and yearend kind of making sure that the books are in order ph took the chargeoffs michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay so theyre burning through kind of to equity cushions at resolution irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah well i think for these specific loans that are problematic certainly the circumstances are unique which is why which is what youre referring to right generally for our borrowers and the loan to value is being so low theres a lot of equity but there are specific situations related to really cash flow which is why we took the charge offs dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i do want to add that overall from a commercial real estate portfolio of multifamily office building hotels retail shopping centers and then all industrial buildings you name it all of that i mean as of today we have a pretty east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 strong portfolio based on not only just the ltv but many of our customers despite the pandemic are still getting by quite well so in fact thats why you see the classified and criticized assets ratio coming down and deferral coming down and surprisingly we always expect that these customers should do well should do better as an average compared with industry as a whole because of the low loan to value and then also many of them have personal guarantee and they have a lot of liquidity but i think the pandemic was a very good stress test to see how overall most of these customers have done well i mean obviously we always have a few isolated incidents here and there and thats what happened michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and maybe just as a followup on the residential lending which seems like might be a larger portion of the growth this year what rate of provision do you put on that and should we expect then kind of a lower growth rate of fee income as a result of that higher mix of resi loans irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah for east west and the residential lending portfolio that we have in this product some variation of it that weve been originating for years the credit quality generally has been outstanding in general the reserve that we have for our singlefamily and also the helocs which i might add are largely ph firstly helocs is quite low relative to the allowance that we bought for the rest of the portfolio and in fact with improvements in the ph four past during the fourth quarter weve reduced the kind of required reserve from about basis points down to basis points overall as i mentioned with the data that we have the historic losses over the course of years its been incredibly low for this portfolio michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you happy new year dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc happy new year thank you operator our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on your nii guide i was just wondering what your thoughts were on adjusted nim that youre expecting in that and given those strong securities growth in the quarter indiscernible your assumptions for that growth and deposit growth which all will ultimately impact earning asset growth and nii as well irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc dave i think your question is really maybe the most unknown thing for us banks right now as far as the liquidity and the deposit growth that most banks are continuing to experience i think for us when we look at the growth of nim nii were very comfortable that well be able to expand from the fourth quarter levels not yearoveryear but certainly from the fourth quarter levels and that well be able to maybe just kind of continue to expand throughout ill also add maybe one of the key drivers of why were comfortable although on the asset side theres some challenges largely asset size things have repriced securities now ill share like for example the securities that were buying in january are probably yielding about or so we have extended out the duration a little bit but not extensively and then what we have there where were more comfortable is we do have a lot of deposits yet and the funding that we expect to reprice over the course of the coming months david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and just one followup on capital you got plenty of excess capital and the buyback is still outstanding you havent done anything with it since early last year i was just wondering what you guys are waiting for at this point it looks like youve had some good improvement on the credit side regulators seem to be warming to it a little bit with the dfas banks announcing buybacks for this quarter so just want to get your updated thoughts there dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah you are right we still currently have a buyback authorization outstanding of million remains at this point we do not anticipate doing any buyback in the near future because frankly we look at where we are right now were excited about the growth opportunities ahead of us and frankly we prefer to have capital available to take advantage of any emerging opportunities that may come and as of today when we looked at where we are from a return perspective currently we are generating attractive return of equity and we actually think we can hopefully do even better going forward so from that point of view its not something that we lack of return that we need buy back to push ph unimpaired  and stuff like that our position is that from my experience for many years at east west bank we always done best whenever theres any kind of economic inflection point and so one of the reasons why we have done that is not just ability to execute and all the other what our associates who had done a great job but more importantly we have a lot of capital always at that time and allow us to be in position to take advantage or turn crisis into opportunities and so forth so i generally inclined to stay with a little bit more capital and ph the group will continue to watch our ability to generate above average return of equity for our shareholders as long as we feel that we can do that and then we will continue to stay in this position for now until a great opportunity to come along that we may deploy capital differently east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 our board of directors all very engaged so the beauty of where we are right now if i looked at from a capital perspective were really looking at the situation that we can just make a zoom call with our board members any time and have a discussion to execute a buyback so its not like there is any kind of repertory constraint or any of the other issues its very different than when were building up a separate ci platform or when we start building something monumental so this is something that is very easy to do and were always shareholders friendly and we know exactly when is the right time to announce a buyback which we did back in early last year so i mean thats the part that we philosophically we are in line with our shareholders and we will do the right thing its just a matter of like level of confidence that we have right now for potential future opportunities and thats what were saying at this point operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey dominic i just wanted to followup on that prior question is there a shift in maybe willingness to do a deal if youre not going to buy the stock i mean i understand the confidence in the growth outlook but im wondering if a deal might be more on the table in than it was in prior years dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i mean were always interest i mean you know if you looked at our capital ratio we always have the capital that allow us to look into various opportunities its just a matter of like when the right deal come along we have the capacity from people perspective from capital perspective to actually to enter into a positive transaction but you also have to take a look at where we are if we reflect that from the last very tiny acquisition that we made was in for metrobank in texas a very small institution for about billion in size and at that time since then weve been growing organically and weve doubled our size in less than six years so weve done pretty well through organic growth so our challenge really is more internal the internal issue is that how do we justify any acquisition when we have the ability to double our size in less than six years and so it looked like going forward we still have that ability to continue to grow organically and so from that perspective any kind of potential acquisition that we looked at it needs to be very attractive so i mean thats what were looking at right now but when the attractive deal comes along we absolutely will be interested to look at it so again as repeat the same philosophical view that i shared earlier is that we are shareholders friendly we always do whats good for the bank and whats good for the shareholders east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color thanks just a followup on the deposit growth the tremendous deposit growth youve seen this year im interested in kind of any niches that are driving a disproportionate amount of that growth in the non interest bearing the ratios it gave the high percent of total deposit thats a great ratio im just wondering what specific businesses might be driving that thanks dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc it is coming from all over the place that is that if i look at the ci industry verticals that we talked about so each and every one of them contributes even in commercial real estate we have new commercial real estate customers that they contributed i would say and then of course at retail banking we are actually doing quite well so i would say that not only each and every one of them ph a contributor i think as i shared earlier in my remarks is that we brought in quite a few new customers would generate deposits and then we also got increase in deposit from existing customers because through the years of investments in the core capability product enhancement in our cash management area our ph payment so our payment capability is getting better and better that in the past we have customers that while we were having a lending relationship we only get a smaller share of the ph pda because we did not have the technical capability to serve a more complex cash management business that some of our clients have these are somewhat sophisticated larger customers the last few years through investing we continue to improve our cash management and treasury management capabilities and also ethics et cetera so that gets us to in a position that we are getting a larger wallet share of this relationship with existing customers so its really a combination of both new and existing customers and i do want to emphasize is that we bring in a lot of small retail customers one customer at a time at the retail branches despite the pandemic our branches were open every single business day and they are there to attract new customers the ppp ppp first round was very helpful in april from april to june we actually brought in quite a few new customers so its all the combination that got us into where we are today so i cant think of any particular one that actually make that big of a difference because its just across the board christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks just going back to i guess the margin discussion i was surprised to see the securities book grow so much and you were able to maintain the yield are you changing i guess the dynamic of what youre purchasing there in terms of taking structure or credit risk in the portfolio and i guess can you talk a little bit about where or how you deployed that billion dollars and what youre buying in that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 jared yeah so in general i would say we havent really taken a lot of credit risk we have extended the duration the duration has gone up quarteroverquarter well obviously because of the steepening the curve but also the securities that were purchasing so as a comparison were about ph as of and thats inched up to and generally if you look at the mix of the securities portfolio thats substantially different from what weve had before as far as what were buying but overall certainly given the lower for a longer environment were taking a long hard look at kind of what were comfortable with from an interest rate risk perspective jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc and then as far as the increase certainly and thats also a function really of us the comfort level as far as the deposit and the deposit growth that we anticipate and then of course especially with our commercial customers sometimes it balances with us can be go up and down depending on their cash needs but as we realize that the excess liquidity throughout was going to continue thats why we took the actions of paying off the ppplf and then some of the securities moving more to securities versus keeping in cash jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay indiscernible good color thanks and then dominic i heard you talk about the increased pace of lending from greater china i guess how do you think thats going to translate into the pace of crossborder trade expectations and whether thats just pure lending or the opportunity for the growth from that type of business as well dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc in terms of the greater china region i think that again we will expect gradual increase in terms of activities and our crossborder team in us actually have done well both in fact theyve grown both in loans deposit and fee incomes and so what we are looking at in is also a continuation of gradual increase just because for the last four years under trump administration that create a lot of hostility between us and china the way that i looked at east west is that we know that we have strong knowledge of the business environment and political environment between us and china and we are very with our size its much easier to be nimble to navigate accordingly so despite the fact that from the medium perspective the perception that uschina business are not doing much at all but the fact as we somehow find a way to get the business but as we go forward in looking at and beyond under the biden administration and i just expect that there will be more predictable approach and it would i think the biden administration would bring more stability to the relationship so from that standpoint we will most likely be able to gain additional business just because that because of the more predictable and more stable environment that customers from both side will be more comfortable to continue to invest and so forth they are going to be certain areas some very what i call sensitive industry that affect national security that obviously will no longer be able to conduct a lot of business between two shores but there are plenty of business that are ph nonnational security sensitive that i expect will continue east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 things such as even tourism students attending colleges in us and some of the other general manufacturing general industries and even in healthcare that do not have these what i call very essential purpose in united states and we expect that there will be more trade and commerce that take place between the two countries so we know what they are and we will continue to target those business opportunities thats why i expect that in the next few years there will be more opportunity to come operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co my first question was just hi my first question was just around the multifamily portfolio it was down slightly this quarter and the growth i think in was about a quarter of what it was the prior year can you just speak to your appetite in that asset class and whether or not youre backing away from certain markets and what your what the prospects are for growth there dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we are not backing away from multifamily our approach has always been we work with our customers that we know well and that have strong credit history and whenever these customers request financing from us we jump into the opportunity now for multifamily there is one factor there are a lot of like fannie mae type of pricing that is hard to beat sometimes we have customers that even theyve been banking with us for many years and always look at us as a first right refusal but there are these very attractive pricing out there that it just makes sense for them to refi for a very low rate and we respect that and so from that standpoint we have i would say that more like a payoff due to refi for a lower rate type of situation to cause our net growth to be slow matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then just maybe for irene the fx and derivative fee income pretty outsized this quarter or is there something that would make that remain elevated here in the near term or should we start to normalize that run rate irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think from a customer income perspective it was a good quarter for both fx and then irc irc and if you the details of this matthew we have on slide of our deck youll see earlier in the year for irc customer revenue was much higher but ill just point out for the fourth quarter the cva marks were positive with the kind of uptick in the year and then also kind of lower kind of credit costs associated with the interest rate contract east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 so for the quarter if you look at irc total gaap revenue was million approximately million of that was customerfacing income and then the cva adjustment was a positive million fx was up we had many more kind of transactions in the fourth quarter particularly kind of quarteroverquarter and from the earlier part and were optimistic that well continue to be able to grow fx yearoveryear matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc oh great thanks for the question you covered greater china performance already i was just going to ask in terms of is that an area now with the change of administration for incremental investment or do you really feel like youve already got the pieces on the board that you need dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well in terms of incremental investment it would depend on the opportunities what we we have plenty of capital to allow the greater china team to grow if need to be but indiscernible never really work on a business model to rely on greater china to keep fast pace of growth in order for us to generate the kind of meaningful financial performance for our shareholders so greater china has always been more strategically important than quantitydriven so from that perspective well continue to look into how we can use hong kong and our china team to look in opportunities frankly in united states many of our domestic ci business chose east west as the banker because of our knowledge of the china business and often many of them either theyre importer or exporter or they may be buying components from china and so forth have that interconnectivity between us and china after all these are the two largest us and china the two largest gdp in the world so that interconnectivity is out there for many of the business throughout us and our team in china who are able to help to provide advice and services in china or in us for our clients make a big difference and differentiate east west dramatically from other regional banks that were competing with so that part has been going well whether we will need to make additional investment or not i think that will depend on any kind of potential changes in regulatory direction from us and china and on what kind of like potential opportunities may come if there is a great opportunity again the previous question about any kind of opportunity will be interesting to look at id always look at it as we look at it broadly and any kind of opportunities that have a high certainty to provide better return for our shareholders we looked at it so at this stage right now i dont really have anything specific to mention i would just say that we always on the lookout to identify opportunities that to deploy our capital wisely brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and more broadly do you anticipate any changes in your business model coming out of covid or not east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc not anything dramatically i would say that we have always been very much running our organization with a very sort of like a diversified approach in terms of making sure that we touch on many different industries in us and we have a good percentage of loans in ci and then wellbalanced between ci cre and singlefamily mortgages from the consumer side and we are generating a stronger fee income every year from wealth management to foreign exchange and then cash management fee income and interest rate swap et cetera et cetera so that is still going to be in place and we are always going to make sure we have a good balance between commercial banking and retail banking there are not many banks out there that are competing with us right now with our size that actually have the strong retail banking business like we do and so thats a big advantage for us and well continue to grow our consumer retail banking business going forward and the other element of greater china is that as i said earlier with theres two big gdp the world largest and the second largest and there are plenty of business for us to identified particularly for an organization like east west that dont really have much competition against us because most of the us banks really do not have this as part of the growth element so we looked at ph out of that its why for years we said our mission and vision in terms of in our business model to focusing on in this direction and i would say that this is more or less the same direction that well be focusing on in the next years or so so at this point were very comfortable with our business strategy going forward brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for the color operator our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks wanted to followup on loan growth ci growth you mentioned turn positive in september and momentum continued into yearend you also mentioned that pipelines have positive momentum as you kind of look out from here but you also mentioned to expect slower growth in ci in the first half of versus the second half of so should we expect kind of similar ci growth in the first half of versus the annualized growth in the fourth quarter of course on an exppp basis and then a further pickup in the second half from there dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc no as i mentioned i think that maybe in one of the qa earlier our keep in mind our fourth quarter annualized growth rate was but if you look at the second half of the year our annualized growth rate was for ci right so were using the run rate as what we expected for the year and at this stage we figure out in the current environment just looking at the current environment with were still trying to figure out do we have enough vaccine for everybody or how many more variants of the coronavirus that may popped up we just looked at it is that maybe the first quarter and two we wouldnt be expecting business to be coming back as business as usual east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 as a strong but i would expect that after this by the summer or after the summer business is going to come back really stronger because most of the economy is going to get back into normal so there will be a pickup then so keep in mind that while were booking commitment and you look at the utilization rate we are somewhat of an alltime low because normally in the past we always have about utilization rate were dropping down to the business are not drawing many of them are not drawing down their lines so we are very pleased that we can book new business bringing in new customers but many of them are still hunkered down and not drawing the lines and until the economy really see some sort of like normalcy i would expect that business will continue to be hesitant to actively draw down the line and actively engage in the ph full flown business so from that standpoint thats why we think that chances are its going to be a little bit slower in the first two quarters and then picking up a little bit stronger in the third and fourth quarter one other factor is that theres always seasonality for some of our ci business that in general things tend to slow down particular expenses slow down the first and second quarter because particular the business cater to consumer retail and theres always like stacking up the inventory right around near the end of summer and then start ph stacking it up all the way to near christmas and that type of core business that we have for years is still a meaningful size of business in our ci portfolio and we expect that business those business would continue to behave accordingly which is a little bit slower in the first and second quarter a little bit stronger in the third and fourth quarter because of the utilization behavior so from that standpoint i think its a combination of different factors that cause us to conclude with this sort of like forecast david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that very helpful and then shifting to a question on credit the oil and gas portfolio classified loans were million down so clearly stress is easing in this portfolio would it be fair to say that the base case is for continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio and theres potential for reserve releases here irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i would say thats not outside of the realm of possibility at this point in time you can just see from the information that we shared we did kind of ph in chop the reserve ratio at yearend compared to september just honestly given kind of the environment we want to maintain kind of a conservative view about that but i would say that if things continue to improve the reserve release is within the realm of possibility david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng for any closing remarks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 dominic ng
