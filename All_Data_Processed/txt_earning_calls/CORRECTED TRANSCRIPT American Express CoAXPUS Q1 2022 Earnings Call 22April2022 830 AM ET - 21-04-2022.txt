to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian and good morning everyone welcome to our first quarter earnings call at our investor day last month we took you through a detailed discussion of our strategies for driving sustainable growth across our businesses and explained why we are confident we can achieve our growth plan aspirations for and beyond as we said then our confidence is based on three interrelated factors the success of the strategy weve been pursuing over the past several years which focuses on investing in our brand customers value propositions coverage technology and talent to build share scale and relevance the momentum weve been generating through the effective execution of that strategy and a number of structural shifts in the payment industry that are contributing to our momentum the strong first quarter results we announced today are tracking in line with our expectations for the fullyear despite the uncertain macro environment and they reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our longer term aspirations for the quarter revenues were billion up yearoveryear and earnings were earnings per share were these results reflect continued momentum in our core business in areas that are critical to sustainable longterm growth including customer acquisitions engagement and retention as well as outstanding credit performance new proprietary card acquisitions remain at their strong pace reaching million this quarter which continues to be driven by strong demand for our premium feebased products particularly among millennial american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 and genz consumers and small and mediumsized businesses in the us we had an alltime high in acquisitions of us consumer platinum and gold cards as well as us business platinum cards this is quarter delta cards acquisitions reached an alltime monthly high in march an indication of the growing demand for travelrelated products and services regarding customer engagement we look at a variety of indicators to measure progress for example card member engagement with our digital capabilities continues to grow with daily active users across the web and mobile up double digits over the last year were also seeing strong engagement with the new benefits we added to our recently refreshed consumer platinum card particularly among millennial and genz card members nearly half of them have used at least one of the new travel and lifestyle benefits todate and we continue to see an acceleration in customer engagement with our resy dining platform including strong doubledigit growth over the last quarter in a number of amex cards on file and a number of restaurants participating in our global dining access program march was one of resys best months on record for reservations up nearly over february ultimately the key metric to gauge customer engagement is spending growth overall billed business grew in q1 globally yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis and we saw our highest volumes ever in march surpassing our previous highest of december of spending growth was led by the acceleration of volumes from millennial and genz consumers up and smes up on an fxadjusted basis over last year goods and services spending continued to accelerate in the quarter growing on an fxadjusted basis over last year travel and entertainment spending was up globally on an fxadjusted basis yearoveryear driven by strong growth in consumer travel spending customer retention remains at the very high levels i mentioned at investor day an indication of the value our customers continue to place on amex membership a major contributor to our success across all of these areas is the ongoing expansion of many partnerships which go well beyond our long strategic partners like delta hilton and amazon we continue to expand relationships with a variety of companies that are adding differentiated value to our membership model for example last week we announced a new financial advice service with vanguard exclusive for our us consumer card members which brings together vanguards digital financial planning and investment management expertise with our industryleading membership rewards this is just the latest example of how were expanding our value propositions beyond our traditional card offerings to meet more of our customers financial and lifestyle needs in addition were accelerating our focus on fintechs to drive more innovation including our new partnership with i2c which will enable fintechs to more seamlessly and quickly issue new products on the american express network we also continue to make progress on our esg initiatives which are important components of our overall business strategy because we recognize that when our customers communities and colleagues thrive so does our company on a diversity equity and inclusion front we are more than three quarters away towards our goal of investing billion in a wide range of actions by including increasing spend with diverse suppliers providing resources and financial assistance to minority owned smes in the us and maintaining pay equity across genders globally and domestics in the us among other efforts our dei progress was cited as one of the key reasons along with our flexible work policies for our number ranking on fortunes list of the best us companies to work for which was announced last week this is the third consecutive year weve been in the top ten which helps us attract and retain talent and we recently announced a series of initiatives coinciding with earth month that are designed to engage our customers community partners and colleagues in our climate efforts including a goal of significantly expanding the use of american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 recycled plastics in our card products these initiatives build on the work weve already done and continue our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint including our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by in summary with this solid start to the year and the continued tailwinds we expect from the ongoing recovery from the pandemic were reaffirming our fullyear guidance of delivering revenue growth in a range of to and earnings per share of between and furthermore we remain confident that successful execution of our strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our longterm growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth in and beyond ill now turn it over to jeff for a deeper dive on the quarter thank you jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our first quarter results which reflect a solid start to and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the fullyear and with our aspiration to build growth momentum beyond starting with our summary financials on slide most importantly our first quarter revenues were billion up on an fxadjusted basis consistent with the momentum we have built and our longerterm growth aspirations our reported first quarter net income was billion with earnings per share of as you know yearoveryear comparisons to net income have been challenging for the industry over the past two years due to the volatility that the pandemic has caused in credit reserve adjustments for that reason we thought it would be a helpful supplemental disclosure this quarter to include our pretax preprovision income that number was billion in the first quarter up versus the comparable number in reflecting growth in our core earnings so now lets get into a little more detailed look at our results starting with volumes as you can see in our slides we have mostly gone back to reporting our volumes on a yearoveryear basis moving away from the comparisons to that we have done in recent quarters we think that returning to a focus on yearoveryear comparisons gives you a better view of the momentum we have built and the momentum we are seeking to maintain as we look towards our longerterm growth objectives starting on slide total network volumes and billed business were both up over yearoveryear in the first quarter on an fxadjusted basis strengthening further from the strong growth rates seen in the past few quarters and as steve highlighted intraquarter while omicrons slow growth in january and early february we then saw a strong acceleration into march with that month achieving our highestever level of monthly billed business and i would point out that the majority of this high level of growth was driven by the momentum we have built and the number of transactions flowing through our network with only a modest impact from inflation now as i talked about at our investor day last month and as slide reiterates the majority of our billed business is spending on goods and services from our consumer and small and mediumsized enterprise customers and as you can see on slide goods and services spending remained robust in the first quarter with yearoveryear growth reaching slightly above the exit rate this momentum is from strong growth in online and card not present spending that continued in the first quarter even as offline spending growth strengthened demonstrating the effect of the structural shift in online commerce that weve seen accelerated by the pandemic american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 and while te spending is a smaller portion of our total billings you see on slide that it is now strongly supporting our growth momentum with overall te spending growing yearoveryear te spending did show a dip in january and early february due to the omicron variant but spending then rebounded tremendously reflecting pentup travel demand and essentially reached levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic in the month of march and this kind of te spending growth has continued right into early april when you then break these spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses as we begin to do on slide there are a few other key points i suggest you take away first our millennial and genz customers continue to drive our highest consumer growth with their spending up yearoveryear and spending growth from all other age cohorts increasing as well in the quarter also of note global consumer te volumes overall were back above levels as of the first quarter led by the growth in the us second our commercial businesses strategic focus on helping sme clients run their businesses continues to drive strong growth in overall sme spending up in the first quarter with acceleration in growth across both the us and international while a smaller part of our overall growth is in this segment i would point out that our large and global corporate clients have begun to show signs of business travel recovery especially in the latter part of the quarter with a yearoveryear growth rate for the quarter of so overall we are pleased with the growth momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our longterm expectations as you then move to receivable and loan balances on slide you see that our growth momentum has brought our ending loan balances roughly back to prepandemic levels in this quarter as i said at investor day the interestbearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarteroverquarter but is still below levels as paydown rates remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base this liquidity and strength is also of course evident as you turn to credit and provision on slides through as we continue to see extremely strong credit performance card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remain well below prepandemic levels and in line with our expectations though they did tick up a bit this quarter as you then turn to the accounting for this credit performance you will see that this quarter we released a large part of the remaining credit reserves we built to capture the significant uncertainty of the pandemic which lacked comparable precedent as we have seen a sustained recovery from the pandemicdriven economic shutdowns we have been able to reduce pandemicdriven reserves while there clearly is still plenty of uncertainty today related to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment we believe that our cecl models are better able to capture our expected credit risk related to these uncertainties to determine the appropriate level of reserves required our strong credit performance combined with the adjustment to our reserves drove a million provision expense benefit for the first quarter as the low writeoffs were fully offset by the net reserve release as shown on slide as you see on slide we ended the first quarter with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively this is well below the reserve levels we had prepandemic given the strong credit performance weve seen going forward as loan balances especially the interestbearing portion of loan balances build more meaningfully we expect delinquency and loss rates to continue to slowly move up over time but remain below prepandemic levels this year wed also expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter although there could be some quarterly volatility and reserve adjustments throughout the year american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 as we move to revenue on slide i do need to explain some changes weve made to our revenue reporting before moving on on to results as a reminder we began reporting processed volumes in the first quarter of last year to better differentiate between volume and cards we issue versus those where we play more of a network role for added transparency we now have moved all of the revenues associated with these volumes out of discount revenue other fees and commissions and other revenue and combined them into a newly created line called processed revenue which you can then match up against our processed volumes we have also consolidated the remaining balances from other fees and commissions and other revenue into one line named service fees and other revenue with the largest components of this line item being service fees earned from merchants like those generated by our loyalty coalition business and foreign currencyrelated revenues such as fx conversion fees this revenue line was up strongly growth yearoveryear in the first quarter as you will see on the next slide this growth was primarily driven by the uptick we have seen in travel related revenues and as i said at investor day we expect this to be a pandemic recovery tailwind throughout this year you will see we have recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release a description of these reporting changes and definitions for key terms will also be included in our form 10q with these changes out of the way lets move to our actual revenue performance beginning on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the first quarter with broadbased revenue growth across all lines our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in q1 on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide this growth was driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued recovery of te spending net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear in the first quarter on an fxadjusted basis with growth reaccelerating versus the to growth rates seen in as you can see on slide as i said at investor day this growth is largely driven by bringing new accounts on to our feepaying products as a result of the investments weve made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractiveness of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers this quarter we acquired million new cards with acquisitions of us consumer and us business platinum card members reaching record high as steve noted earlier demonstrating great demand for our products especially our premium feebased products moving on to net interest income on slide you will see that it surpassed levels for the first time this quarter mainly driven by lower interest expense in part due to our increased mix of deposits which is generally our lowest cost funding source particularly in todays rising rate environment first quarter yearoveryear net interest income growth of while very strong remained slower than the growth in our lending ar as revolving loan balances continue to rebuild and so we expect net interest income to be a pandemic recovery tailwind to our revenue growth in to sum up on revenues on slide were tracking well against our expectations and looking forward we still expect to see revenue growth of to for the fullyear of so all of the revenue momentum we just discussed was driven by the investments weve been making in marketing value propositions coverage technology and talent and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement expenses the strong spending growth in customer engagement as steve discussed earlier is driving the growth in these expense lines in total these costs came in at of total revenues for the first quarter and are tracking in line with our expectation for variable customer engagement costs to run at around of total revenues for the fullyear on american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 the marketing line we invested billion in the first quarter on track with our expectation to spend around billion in we feel really good about the strong momentum of our new card acquisitions as i talked about earlier and more importantly about the revenues from those acquisitions which is trending significantly higher than what we saw prepandemic we continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities even beyond those we are currently funding moving to the bottom of slide operating expenses were billion in the first quarter tracking with our expectation to spend a bit over billion for the fullyear while opex was up yearoveryear this quarter it is important to note that we were growing over a benefit of million in net marktomarket gains in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio from the first quarter of last year including in the opex line i would point out that while i said earlier that inflation is having some modest positive impact on volumes it is also putting some pressure on our operating expenses but well have to wait to see how material any impact might be for the full year in any event i still expect to have far less growth in opex compared to revenues and see these costs as a key source of leverage turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter including common stock repurchases of billion and million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation our cet1 ratio was at the end of the first quarter within our target range of to we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth that brings me to our growth plan on slide and then well open up the call for your questions for the fullyear we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of to in earnings per share of between and we continue to expect the amount of our volumes revenues and core earnings to sequentially strengthen throughout the year driven in part by our pandemic recovery tailwinds as i mentioned earlier theres clearly uncertainty as it relates to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment as we sit here today despite that uncertainty the combination of our investments successful execution of our strategy and a number of structural shifts have all come together to deliver our strong first quarter results and build growth momentum we remain committed to executing against our new growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth on a sustainable basis in and beyond and with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions alan american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw go ahead please sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning obviously the te rebound is happening at a brisk pace despite some of these lingering concerns on covid cases economic weakness jeff you mentioned large corporate also recently saw strong rebound recently could you talk about how much of the volume rebound is being driven by unit demand versus sort of inflationary pressures and how worried are you or your corporate clients about some of these issues like supply chain constraints and the economic concerns thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so let me start and jeff can maybe add some color as well but this is not being driven by inflation try and book a flight so thats not inflation that doesnt mean that the airline prices are not a little bit higher but not just for te but just for the overall business transactions are up we had billings up thats not sort of driven all by inflation we dont have of inflation but as far as travel goes you have to realize people have not been traveling for probably two years there is a tremendous pentup demand for travel i mean our bookings just from a consumer perspective on a global basis were up about in the us they were up and thats not over last year thats over so people are looking to get out there and travel and i think thats whats driving this that is not it is not inflationdriven when we look at that te number the other thing i think is important with the te number is a great number but also lets put it in context its over last year its not over so were not all the way back consumer is back but were not all the way back as far as large corporations go were seeing it in our own company people are looking to get out and not only gather with their own colleagues but theyre also looking to get out and meet with customers youre seeing conferences come back and so forth and so i know in our own company we are getting together as a senior management team our top people we have some sales meetings that are going on because people have not seen each other as well as youre seeing customers opening up their offices and i think as far as covid affecting all of this i think we are starting to learn to live with this the reality is covid is not something i think weve all learned that is going away well wind up dealing with this as we deal with the flu as we deal with strep throat as we deal with other viruses people will continue to get have colds and get sick and off well go but i think the world is opening back up at this point and people are excited to go out and see the world again both from a business perspective and from a consumer perspective jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co the only thing i would briefly add sanjay is when you think about travel and entertainment spend some of that increase is not so much inflation as it is a return to people buying more front of airplane or highend hotel or high end restaurant oriented some of that is the business travel rebound where your average business travel american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 purchase is of course much higher than the average consumer purchase the other comment id make going forward is theres certainly lots of uncertainty in the world but when you look at everything we see in our actual results and business you just cant really see any sign of weakness that thats causing as of today operator our next question will come from the line of mihir bhatia with bank of america go ahead please mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning steve jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning mihir jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you for taking my question a lot has changed since guidance was initially set and i am curious if you could maybe just talk about how your plans for the year have been evolving since they were established are there areas that made sense to lean into now versus what you thought coming into the year versus maybe pulling back in others like i guess im just trying to understand the flexibility in the model particularly on the expense side in terms of as things change whats changing under the hood even as you maintain guidance maybe just give us a flavor of that thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i think as far as flexibility i think look we demonstrated we have tremendous flexibility during the pandemic especially as that related to our marketing expenditures and obviously as consumers and business travelers didnt use our card member services you saw flexibility there so that so those things we do have some control over but as far as the plan and the guidance that we have we feel really comfortable where we are from a to but more importantly i think we feel comfortable on what we are doing day by day to make sure that we are in line with tracking what our growth aspirations which is a sustainable revenue and midteens eps and thats how were running the company as far as what we see under the hood we see as jeff mentioned a range of good investment opportunities and you have to understand when we see investment opportunities from a card acquisition perspective they are here today and gone tomorrow so if you dont act on them you dont get them and so we will continue to drive value shareholder value by continuing to invest in the business and to grow the business for the medium to the long term and thats been a strategy thats worked for us and that is going to be how were going to run it but right now if i was to look at the beginning of the year versus now id probably see better investment opportunities today than i did with the plan but as we know those investment opportunities they pay back over american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 time and what they do is they set us up better for and for so we feel really good about the guidance we feel really good about the underlying investments that were making and well continue to make jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and the only sort of simple financial summary id put to that mihir when we gave the guidance for our revenue ambitions are quite ambitious we feel really good about the momentum we built but we have more investment opportunities as i said in my remarks than we probably anticipated and maybe a little bit of pressure on cost from inflation so all of those things i think position us really well to build momentum towards our longterm target of sustainable over revenue growth operator our next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi so given the expected fed moves to cool the economy and tame inflation like what degree of slowing in network volumes or billed business volumes lets go with do you incorporate in your outlook and then on the te side i know you indicated its up nicely and continues in april how do you view this trending as the fed tightens and the economy cools through the year stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co the general comment id make john is as you know we dont have inhouse economists so we tend to say we should run the economy and run our guidance to run the business when our guidance based on the macroeconomic consensus which is not for there to be a recession and the fed will say that they are certainly focused on bringing inflation down without causing a recession so thats whats built into our guidance and thats how were running the company i think as steve pointed out earlier we have clearly demonstrated over the last couple years our ability to manage the company in a very agile way and react to a scenario thats different than what i just described but in terms of our base levels of planning i dont think its our role to secondguess that general macroeconomic consensus operator our next question will come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to just dig in a little bit on the loan growth and the card fee growth as you indicated the loan growth is still has room to run so maybe and as well the impact on the nii so maybe can you help us understand is it the nii thats likely to accelerate here but loan growth will be stabilizing or how are you thinking about that and also how it relates to the card fees which i noticed were up nicely in the quarter thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well card fees are up because we continued to acquire more cards and were continuing to acquire and i think we acquired of the consumer cards we acquired were feebased card which is still slightly below where we were i think prepandemic so what is important to understand is our card the majority of our card fee growth comes from new cards that we acquire so it doesnt just come from the fee increase but weve also had a fee increase which will come in over time so we feel really good about where we are from a card fee perspective let me just make one comment on sort of our overall loan growth and then jeff can get into the details but the reality is prepandemic we were growing slightly faster than the industry we tend to have a lower share of our card members loan wallet than we do of their spending wallet and our intent is to grow judiciously but we will probably hope to get back to growing and we are growing faster than the industry but to get our balances back up but ill let jeff comment on the rest jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well id just emphasize the financial implication steve of what you just said which is we are now betsy growing those lending balances faster than the industry and we absolutely expect that to continue so theres a lot of runway for growth on the lending side and because of quarters like we just had with a record level of new us platinum and gold cards on the consumer side and a record level of us business platinums id expect net card fee growth to probably accelerate even further from where it is operator our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co bill jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hey so youve clearly navigated the pandemic exceptionally well and your acceleration in investment spending couldnt have been better timed as evidenced by your customer acquisition growth but as you look ahead from here i wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments are you at all concerned over the risk that the fed may be forced to actually push the economy into recession to tame inflation does that give you any pause to be growing aggressively into that i mean everything looks great now but just would love to hear your thoughts a bit more on how you think about that risk and maybe if you could help us understand how you think the amex customer base would perform in that kind of environment jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well as i said earlier we are always in terms of our guidance planning for what the macroeconomic consensus has while also making sure were thinking about other possibilities and certainly bill as just one example we are doing work today and making adjustments on the risk management side as we think about what the impact is of sustained levels of inflation at its current level on different aspects of our customer base we want to make sure were positioned from a risk perspective for that although that is not the macroeconomic consensus so i think we demonstrated over the last couple years again our ability to be agile and manage through a downturn should that happen and were trying to strike all those same balances right now operator well go next to the line of mark devries with barclays go ahead please mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks steve i think in your prepared comments you alluded to both the new partnership with vanguard and also some really strong activity out of resy could you just help us think through how kind of those two initiatives really impact the top line stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think the way you got to think about both of these is we are constantly and continuously adding more benefits and more services to the card when you look at both of those partnerships they unto themselves they do not drive top line growth what they do do though is they in our mind drive more engagement drive more retention and give people more reason to want to be with the card now ill just talk about resy for a second resy is not only a vehicle for giving our card members access to restaurant reservations and card members do get access to the global dining program but its also a card acquisition vehicle as well because resy is an open platform and so resy was all about what our where our american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 card members spend their money and how we can integrate more with restaurants and connect our card members and really take advantage of our closed loop in a different way not just for payments but the reservation piece and then which leads to payments and so when you look at the partnerships that we have that are sort of around the core of the card and im not talking about the delta cobrand partnerships and so forth but when you look at the other things that we do add on what were constantly adding to our products are more services better access more experiences and so forth so that you continue to build the value propositions in different and more sustainable ways and vanguard is an example of offering an investment service opportunity for card members that want to take advantage of it that combines vanguards digital advisor service with the personal advisor service and puts an mr component into it and so well continue to look at other lifestyle financial and travel and entertainment services that just add to the overall underlying value of our card products operator well go next to the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning steve good morning jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey ryan jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so steve maybe a question for both of you so steve you talked about the investment opportunities looking better and then jeff you talked about the potential to build reserves so im assuming youre talking about reserve dollars and do you think were at the bottom on the reserve rate and also despite recession for you guys credit continues to outperform expectations and if we do continue to see better credit steve how are you thinking about the potential to lean further into opportunities to continue to acquire cards and move towards your aspirational targets for indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well let me answer questions one and three and jeff can answer question two so if i remember one and three but look the reality is is that we continue to see good opportunities and as those opportunities continue to arise well continue to invest in them whats important to know is that when we make an investment were making those investments through the cycle so as we underwrite rois and as we underwrite and we look at rois we feel good about what we see now why are those opportunities presenting themselves well i think for a couple reasons number one i think the premium card space has been expanding i think especially as you think about genzs coming into the american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 workforce i think about millennials which are getting a bit older now but millennials who are still gravitating to the product so the opportunities have arisen i think because the pool for our products has been getting bigger and bigger and weve talked about this in the past when we used to look at people coming into our franchise we used to start them off on feefree cards well a lot of our feefree cards are probably not as differentiated as some of the others and we have better service and so forth but when you look at the value of the products of the feefree products the fee products that were offering a smart consumer and a smart small businessperson can really generate a lot more value out of those products than theyre paying for the card and as you know with our value propositions given our partner network we work with our partners to provide value to our card members and it all works out for all three of us the card member the partner and for us i think the other thing thats important and youve seen a growth in small business acquisition as well is more and more small businesses are forming and thats one of the structural shifts that we are taking advantage of and to get to the third question and jeff can get to the second question which if he remembers it at this point but to get to your third one we take if credit continues to perform better we release more reserves will we take advantage of opportunities we will continue to take advantage of those opportunity tis as they present themselves as i said were running this for the medium to longterm and it really is irresponsible in my opinion of me to pass up really good investment opportunities that will pay off over the longer term i think one of the things that youve seen this year is look were committing to to revenue growth off of basically off of a revenue base and youve never seen that from us before and that is a direct result of us investing in our card members investing in our brand and not walking away from good investment opportunities jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co ryan to come back on the credit side maybe just to clarify my remarks so when you look at the credit reserves we closed the first quarter with i would expect the dollar level of those reserves to be higher by the time you get to the end of the year because i very much expect our ir balances to grow whether the reserve rate grows is much less clear and its probably more going to be a function of where economic forecasts go could the reserve rate go lower well i dont think our delinquencies or writeoffs are going to go lower so the only thing just mechanically that could cause other reserve rates to go down would be a dramatic improvement in the balanced economic outlook which probably would mean all the uncertainties in the world go away so if magically that were to happen i suppose its mechanically possible the reserve rate would go lower but i would have to say thats pretty unlikely sitting here operator well go next to the line of meng jiao with deutsche bank go ahead meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc morning guys thanks for taking my question stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co morning meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 just on the competitive environment i mean weve seen a competitor come over with a new travel offering and premium travel space is always tough but that doesnt seem to be stopping you guys much if at all im just wondering can you quantify sort of the market share that you guys have taken and also speak to any potential headwinds youre keeping an eye on in the landscape currently thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i mean look we this is a competitive space when youre talking about the us consumer its a competitive space its always been a competitive space and it will continue to be a competitive space and youve got capital one out there with a new product and jpmorgan all terrific companies that are looking to double down on the premium side of it and well continue to again going back to what i said when we the question was asked about resy and vanguard and so forth were going to continue to add value to the products and making sure that were still topofmind and top of wallet and that look we have record acquisitions however its still a competitive space when you think about competition though we just dont think about competition in the us consumer we also think about it in us small business which is competitive as well and you can go market by market by market both from a small business perspective and so there is a lot of competition out there we keep our eye on the competition and our objective is to continue to understand what our customer needs are understand where our customer needs are going and continue to develop our products and services and the reality is you just dont you dont launch a product and then sort of go to sleep for a few years and then say okay in three years well come up with a new one were constantly adding value and i think you saw that as we added more value to the platinum card even after the refresh when we put the walmart benefit on so we always assume high competition and we always assume that the competition is really good and that has served us well having that mindset running the business jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co the one thing steve id add is id take people back to your discussion at investor day about what you call the virtuous cycle which is the faster we can continue to grow our premium customer base the more were also successful in attracting partners who want access to that base and help fund and further improve the value proposition and thats one of the most important ways we operate in a very competitive space stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co thats a real good callout and remember that virtuous cycle sits on top of an actual network right because where we get those partners from are from our network our merchant network and so you have this physical merchant network and were able to create that sort of flywheel to drive more and more value not only of card members but to partners and the more as jeff said the more premium cardholders you have and the more value our customers get the more they want to invest in that base operator our next question will come from chris donat with piper sandler go ahead christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co good morning thanks for taking my question american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning chris jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning chris christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co yeah just wanted to yeah hi just wanted to double check on the net card fees and the yearonyear growth there and the acceleration in the growth so a bit of that being a function of new additions but also fee changes should we expect a similar yearonyear trajectory for the next four quarters as you recognize some of that revenue over time or is this a onetime kind of bump jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co no so indiscernible jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah its good question chris as i pointed out earlier demand has i think i showed a chart at investor day the majority of the growth in net card fees is driven by bringing more customers into the high fee paying products not by any particular price increase although the price increases when we price or adding valueadd a little bit when you think about the rate at which weve been bringing new premium card members into the franchise record first quarter for us platinum gold on the consumer side and business platinum that mechanically now just makes me pretty darn confident that as you look at the next few quarters that is likely to even further accelerate a little bit as we build on the acquisition momentum we have because as i think it sounds like you recall the accounting for fees youre amortizing them over months from when theyre paid so theres a fairly predictable effect here operator our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi guys thanks and appreciate you taking my question id love to understand the really strong first quarter results in context of maintaining guidance and your previous comments about sequential build throughout the year obviously theres going to be some normalization of provision expense but i am wondering what this says about operating leverage and efficiency ratio given your accelerating top line jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 well i think the very careful word that i inserted rick when we talked about sequential growth was in what were calling core earnings which is why we included that pretax preprovision net income number on the first page because the credit reserves are going to bounce all over the place although in terms of dollars i would expect credit reserves at the end of the year assuming ar continues to grow as we expect to be a little bit higher so i absolutely do expect pretax preprovision net income to be a little bit stronger each quarter as you go through the year i dont expect that necessarily of gaap earnings per share because we just had really we pulled forward in many ways a goodsized credit reserve release into q1 that drove your gaap eps up to i do not expect sequential growth off that number if you just do the simple math thats pretty obvious given our eps guidance the other point id come back to is we feel really good about the revenue momentum but boy steve i think has made very clear our focus on pursuing good investment opportunities when they arise and so were very comfortable with the eps guidance weve given for the year operator our next question will be from lisa ellis with moffettnathanson go ahead please lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc good morning thanks for taking my question stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi lisa lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hi i was hoping to dig in a little bit on the new card acquisition with proprietary cardsinforce at million it was up yearonyear i was just peaking back to the model we havent seen a quarter up since back in so can you just talk a little bit about whats driving that acceleration in card acquisition and specifically is that temporary like the return of the delta cobrand growth or is it more that youre just seeing a higher roi on some of your card acquisition marketing spending jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yes stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean look i think we are seeing a little bit of a higher roi on our card acquisition spending and as we said i think theres just theres an expanding pool its not just the consumer base but its also the small business base ill go back to my comments before the millennial and genz pool is expanding there are more small businesses out there and as we look at the opportunities we were able to bring in probably some more cards than we probably were in the first quarter and we see opportunities going forward so well continue to invest to grow the card base american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 but remember were looking at were just not looking at growing cards these cards are hitting our return youve got a large percentage of these cards are feepaying cards but ill also go back to i think its in either my comments or in jeffs script of the cards that we did acquire from a consumer perspective were millennial cards which are up which was prepandemic so it is a bigger pool for us to acquire it from from a millennial genz perspective and there are small businesses so right now we feel good about card growth how that translates next quarter look the last few quarters weve had sequential card growth quarter to quarter and coming off last year look there wasnt a tremendous amount of card growth in the first quarter from a relative basis and a comparative basis but it continued to move up every single quarter and we feel good about what happened this particular quarter can it be again next quarter dont really know operator our final question will come from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes in sme i noticed capital one is marketing a no limit small business card i was just curious i know thats part of your secret sauce obviously if you thought that was material and then lastly on fintechs like i know you have partnerships with billcom and coupa but do they represent a threat in any way to your business stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so just im sorry just one other point for lisa just retention helps a lot and our retention numbers if you look at the last couple of years have improved significantly so if you think about your base is having a leak in it the leak got a lot smaller so thats i think thats important don as far as fintechs go i think theres some opportunities for us and i think the partnership with i2c we already have a partnership with them in latin america and i think this will just make it easy to onboard fintechs that want to have american express because the reality is a lot of them not a lot of most of them dont do their own processing theyll partner with somebody else to do this and having i2c and being able now to do this on a global basis will enable us to approach so i dont look at that as a necessarily a threat i look at this as an opportunity for us and what was the first part of your question don jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co capital one stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co cap one no limit i dont know what no limit i really dont know what no limit is and so yes i think what theyve done is put out a no preset spending limit but and im not being flippant here i just dont know what that no preset spending limit is so well see how that plays out american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2022 again a really good company it had lots and lots of success very tough competitor theyre the first ones to go down this road and well see how it all plays out how it all plays out but we take them very seriously as we take everybody else yes it is part of our secret sauce and well see so again just look at the results in the first quarter for us we had growth from a small business perspective so we feel pretty good about small business at this point jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co and a record quarter for business platinum stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co acquisition yes
