chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey thanks kristin good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today first quarter brought many unexpected challenges in the environment nonetheless we proved resilient and adaptable and we delivered a solid quarter for our stakeholders we maintained a strong capital liquidity and funding position with our cet1 ratio at our tce ratio at and a solid deposit franchise that skews twothirds consumer weve seen the churn in the deposit market continue to diminish since the bank failures with our deposits broadly stable in the month of march for the quarter we posted underlying earnings per share of and return on tangible equity of our nii was down reflecting day count impact slightly lower earning assets and a stable net interest margin of noninterest income and noninterest expense came in broadly as expected both impacted by seasonality our credit metrics are also trending as expected and we built our acl to loans ratio to which was up basis points during the quarter and basis points higher than our pro forma day one cecl acl ratio we repurchased million in shares during the quarter which reduced our share count by in our slide deck we tackle head on some of the industry issues that investors have been concerned about ill let john run through the details but the headline is that we have strong confidence in our capital liquidity and funding position we have been conservative in maintaining a capital ratio near the top of our peer group in focusing on a stable consumeroriented and granular deposit base and in establishing a prudent credit risk appetite and reserve level while we have some commercial real estate exposure we feel good about our diversification the asset characteristics and the borrower quality cre criticized assets and workouts will increase during the cycle but we currently expect losses to be manageable and weve already set aside meaningful reserves on the regulatory front it is clear that some changes will occur our hope is that the response is thoughtful and appropriate leaving the bank landscape that has served our country so well intact and even stronger than before in any case we anticipate any changes will follow a review and comment process with any revisions likely to be phased in gradually while much of the past month has been focused on playing strong defense we continue to play prudent offense by investing in and advancing our strategic initiatives we will clearly prioritize deposits deepening and efficiency initiatives for the balance of our new york city metro integration is progressing extremely well with the successful core conversion of investors bank in february and growth metrics that are well ahead of plan our outlook for still shows attractive rotce for the full year despite the challenging environment there is still a great deal of uncertainty which makes forecasting more difficult but we remain confident in the strength of our franchise and the ability to weather the storm we are building a great bank and we remain excited about our future our capital strength and attractive franchise should position us to be nimble and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise with that let me turn it over to john to take you through more of the financial details john citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone let me start with the headlines for the financial results referencing slide big picture first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of volatility in the macro environment we continued to progress against our portfolio of strategic initiatives including the wellexecuted conversion of the investor platform in february for the first quarter we generated underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was net interest income was down linked quarter given the lower day count and lower interest earning assets our margin was stable at period end loans and average loans were down slightly quarteroverquarter reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts such as our ongoing runoff of auto deposits also declined in the quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonal factors the compounding impact of the rate environment and particularly earlier this occurred in the quarter importantly our deposit levels were broadly stable during the market turbulence in march our quarter end ldr is and our liquidity position remains very strong with current available liquidity as of today of about billion our credit metrics and overall position remains solid total net chargeoffs of basis points are up basis points linked quarter in line with ongoing normalization trends weve recorded a provision for credit losses of million and a reserve build of million this quarter increasing our acl coverage to up from at the end of the fourth quarter with most of the increase directed to the general office portfolio our current coverage ratio is about basis points stronger than our pro forma day one cecl reserve of we repurchased million of common shares in the first quarter and delivered a strong cet1 ratio at the top of our target range at and our tangible book value per share is up linked quarter before i walk through the detail of results for the quarter let me address some of the industry issues that are top of mind on slide first we have a very strong capital base which is one of the highest in our regional bank peer group even if one were to include the ratedriven unrealized losses on all of our investment securities we have a quality deposit franchise which has performed very well since the turbulence which began in early march we continue to see the benefit from all of the investments weve made since the ipo with of total deposits from consumer and a welldiversified commercial portfolio with about of our clients using us as their primary bank finally of deposits are insured or secured our liquidity position is quite strong with a diverse funding base ample available liquidity and strong risk management capabilities in fact our lcr level exceeds what would be required as a category iii bank at march looking at credit our metrics continue to look solid retail is normalizing but is still performing quite well as the employment picture remains strong on the commercial side our focus is on the cre portfolio and on general office in particular which is impacted by back to work trends and rising interest rates we have a very strong reserve coverage of on the general office portfolio and ill go through some of the details later and lastly the market is concerned about how the regulators may respond to the disruption in march which in our view was unique to the banks in question and not reflective of broader gaps in regulation or management citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 lapses well watch closely how things develop but in any case we think the process will be thoughtful and deliberate finally we believe we are wellpositioned for any increase in regulatory requirements given our diverse business model and current excess capital and liquidity regulatory ratios lets drill into the details on the next few slides starting with capital on slide we ended the quarter with one of the highest capital levels in our regional bank peer group with a cet1 ratio at the top of our target range of this strong capital level reflects our prudent approach to deploying capital as we prioritize driving improved returns over the medium term if you include the ratedriven unrealized loss on debt securities in aoci our adjusted cet1 ratio would be if you remove the unrealized loss in htm our tangible common equity ratio would reduce by basis points to all of these ratios are expected to be near the top of our peer group again in this quarter we expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly basis points of capital post dividend each quarter and before share buybacks we have billion of repurchase capacity remaining under our current board authorization timing of repurchases will be dependent on our view of external conditions next ill move to slide to discuss our deposit franchise as you can see our deposit franchise is skewed towards consumer and highly diversified across product mix and in terms of the various channels we can tap about of our total deposits are consumer up from at december which puts us in the top quartile of our peer group and roughly of our deposits are insured by the fdic or secured which is up from at yearend demand deposits represent about of the book down slightly from at yearend as customers have naturally rotated towards higher yielding alternatives on slide the headline is that our deposit performance since midyear following the investors acquisition and the commencement of qt has been in line with industry performance we outgrew both the industry and peer average in the second half of we entered expecting that the normal seasonal deposit outflows in the first quarter would be somewhat exacerbated by the higher rate environment and we saw a little more of that than we had forecast by about but most of that happened in january and february given our rundown in auto we were willing to let some deposits run off early in the quarter trying to hold the line on betas in march we saw some elevated inflows and outflows as customers across the industry look to diversify their deposits in the wake of bank failures but overall our deposits were broadly stable during the month this strong performance is attributable to investing heavily in our deposit offerings and capabilities since the ipo and this will remain a focus as we continue to build a topperforming bank franchise on slide we highlight some of the things that we are doing to attract deposits and drive primacy with our customers in consumer weve developed a compelling set of products and features that drive higher customer satisfaction and encourage them to do more with us we have strong analytics capabilities and compelling offerings such as citizensplus in our private client group as well as citizens access our digital bank to leverage and with the final conversion complete at investors we have a substantial opportunity to take deposit share in the new york metro market on the commercial side we have invested heavily in our treasury solutions capabilities with a stateoftheart platform and strong talent to serve client needs we continue to add better tools for our clients to manage their cash and drive higher operational deposits as well as innovative products and capabilities to attract deposits citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 moving to slide we are monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio closely given the softening macro environment and the pressure of rising rates impacting refinance needs the general office sector is of particular concern as tenants rethink their space needs given the remote work trends given these pressures we are evaluating our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress in particular cre office its worth noting however that near of our borrowers are current on their obligations with npls under basis points we are starting to see an increase in criticized assets and added workout resources but given the diversity and quality of the portfolio we feel the credit costs will be manageable our total cre allowance coverage of includes an elevated coverage for the general office portfolio of on slide we drill down a bit on the 63billion office portfolio which includes billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends and are expected to perform quite well the remaining billion relates to the general office segment which we feel is reasonably well positioned across type geography and suburban areas and central business districts about of the general office portfolio was income producing and about is located in suburban areas and the majority is class a next ill provide further details related to first quarter results on slide net interest income was down given the lower day count which was worth about million and slightly lower interest earning assets the net interest margin of was stable with the increase in asset yields offset by higher funding costs with fed funds increasing basis points since the end of our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at through the end of the quarter we continue to dynamically adjust our hedge position so that we have downright protection in the second half of and through as we approach the height of the rate cycle we have managed our asset sensitivity down from roughly at the end of last year to a more neutral at the end of the first quarter moving on to slide we posted solid fee results despite seasonality and headwinds from market volatility and higher rates fees showed some resilience amid a challenging environment down linked quarter with seasonal impact in capital markets and service charges partly offset by strength in fx and derivatives revenue and a modest improvement in mortgage banking fees focusing on capital markets market volatility continued through the quarter and syndications and ma advisory fees were seasonally lower we continue to see good strength in our ma pipelines and signs that deal flow should pick up as the year progresses mortgage fees are slightly better with higher production fees as we are seeing our volumes rising and margins improving with the industry reducing capacity this should continue to benefit margins over time and finally card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter on slide expenses came in better than expected up only linked quarter given seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits as well as the impact of an industrywide fdic surcharge implemented at the beginning of the year on slide average loans were down slightly and periodend loans down linked quarter including the impact of planned auto runoff we have seen commercial utilization decrease a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this as well as lower capex in anticipation of reduced economic activity average retail loans are down slightly reflecting the planned runoff in auto which was largely offset by growth in mortgage and home equity on slide average deposits were down billion or linked quarter driven by seasonal and rate related outflows as i mentioned earlier the majority of the deposit decrease occurred in january and february with citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 balances broadly stable in march our interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points which translates to a sequential data and a cumulative data moving on to slide we saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter which reflects continued normalization nonperforming loans are basis points of total loans up basis points from the fourth quarter as an increase in commercial was offset by improvements in retail retail delinquencies were broadly stable with the fourth quarter and continue to remain favorable to historical levels but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is faring turning to slide ill walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter we increased our allowance by million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown and the outlook for losses in the commercial portfolio particularly general office our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a 4basis point increase from the fourth quarter the current reserve level calculation contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios such as cre moving to slide we maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio increased to which is at the top end of our target range tangible book value per share was up in the quarter and the tangible common equity ratio has improved to we returned a total of million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends shifting gears a bit on slide we continue to make good progress with our push into the new york metro market we were very excited to complete the branch and systems conversion at investors in february which went very smoothly with that behind us we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities to capture market share we continue to be encouraged by the strong early momentum we are seeing in the branches where customer satisfaction has been improving significantly and we continue to see some of the highest customer acquisition sales rates in our network across the legacy hsbc and investors branches weve also seen some good early client wins and a growing pipeline in commercial we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customerfocused retail and small business model across the new york market moving to slide for a quick update on our top program our latest top program is well underway and progressing well given the external environment we have begun to look for opportunities to augment our top program in order to protect returns as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance well have more to say about this in the coming months moving to slide ill walk through the outlook for the second quarter and give you an update on our outlook for the full year that takes into account a modest economic slowdown with the fed expected to raise rates by basis points in may and then begin easing late in the year for the second quarter we expect nii to decrease about noninterest income is up mid to highsingle digits noninterest expense should be stable to down slightly net chargeoffs should remain in the mid basis points our cet1 is expected to come in above with some share repurchase planning depending upon our view of the external environment moving to slide as we think about the full year we remain focused on maintaining strong capital liquidity and funding position while sustaining attractive returns of course there is a continued level of uncertainty in the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 current environment for the full year we expect nii to be up to we are focused on initiatives that will stabilize and even grow our deposits modestly from first quarter levels over the remainder of the year noninterest income is expected to be up midsingle digits noninterest expense is expected to be up about net chargeoffs are expected to be in the mid to high basis points our current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and known risks and there should be less of a need for further reserve builds given anticipated spot loan decline for the year as auto runs down and our cet1 ratio is expected to be above the upper end of our to target range at to assuming stable market conditions our share repurchases are expected to build over the course of the year to sum up on slide we delivered a solid quarter despite unexpected challenges and are ready for the uncertainty that lies ahead in our strong capital liquidity and funding position will serve us well to move forward with our strategic priorities and deliver attractive returns this year as we balance the need for strong defense with the imperative of continuing to play prudent offense to strengthen the franchise for the future even as we navigate through the current challenging environment we reaffirm our commitment to our mediumterm financial targets with that ill hand back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john alan lets open it up for some qa question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the conference call operator instructions your first question will come from the line of erika najarian with ubs go ahead please erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc as we contemplate your original net interest income guide of to now up to could you walk us through what the major changes are in assumptions and how much of it was cyclical such as the deposit runoff higher beta and how much of it could be a little bit more structural as you anticipate different rules such as carrying higher liquidity funded by wholesale funding bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 yeah let me start and ill quickly flip it to john but i would say erika that really were just recognizing what weve seen in the deposit markets and the cost of deposits is going up i think that was partly a response to kind of the fed rapid rises and money funds becoming alternative so there was i think a greater sensitivity around earning a return on cash that kicked in and then that was i think further exacerbated by the bank failures in march and so i think there was kind of heightened velocity of deposits moving around the system and so to retain those deposits folks had to increase rate paid we feel that we did a pretty good job here we came into the year expecting that thered be some seasonal outflows in q1 and since we had built deposits in the second half of the year and then we had auto running down so less volume on the asset side we were prepared to let those run down by about in the quarter we actually saw about higher than that in the runoff but in any case we tried to hold the line on betas and i think the betas that we posted are slightly better than peers that have reported at this point but if you kind of play out the rest of the year were going to be paying more for our funding than we thought coming into the year and thats pretty much the big driver i would say there might be kind of a little more discipline in terms of who we are extending credit to given i think probably a higher likelihood that we could see a short and shallow recession so there might be a little volume impact there from slightly lower earning assets and maybe there is a little mix where were holding a little precautionary cash but if i had to kind of put it in order i would say number one is the cost of deposits and maybe slightly the volume on assets and then thirdly would be composition so john ill flip it to you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah those are the right points to focus on id say you break it down erika between rate and volume on the rate side as you heard from bruce we have the migration from a deposit standpoint youre going to see the full year effect of that of whats happened over the last quarter or two and the drivers of that are welldocumented weve got the cycle with higher rates and quantitative tightening going on thats causing those forces to kind of hit us i would also say that beta did move up a bit more than maybe we had planned given the outlook so we were i think in the high prior maybe were in the low through the through the cycle so were building that in we also mentioned that from a liquidity standpoint i think we feel very good about that from a we are already compliant if we were a category iii bank were already compliant on the lcr but from a volume standpoint we are in rundown in auto were looking at some balance sheet optimization initiatives in commercial and so youll see the ldr fall throughout the rest of the year and then finally i would say that the other things i look at on the positive side i mean our loan betas from a cumulative standpoint will still exceed cumulatively where were coming out on deposits so youll see that mid to upper on loans versus the low on deposits you got front book back book when the fed finally kind of pauses and starts to starts to cut youll see a lot of the balance sheet continue to contribute over the quarters post maybe a possible pause and cut that the fed may kind of engage in so lots to bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 you might add too john about the swaps that we continue to dynamically recalibrate the swaps to provide protection for the event that the fed ultimately moves lower john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think its a really good point i mean when you think thats what we were just talking about is the sort of story i mean when you get to the end of into this cycle compared to last cycle we have a lot more downrate protection in place for the second half of and into than we might have had in prior cycles so if you notice were bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island which will help support a good guide for john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i guess just to close this off erika i would say if you look at the outlook for the year kind of the one thing that got marked down was really nii we still feel pretty good about the fee outlook were going to work a little harder on expenses and probably bring that in below where we thought coming into the year id say credit provisioning should be about kind of where we thought coming into the year were still angling to repurchase shares over the course of the year so our expectation is that we can continue to deliver return on tangible equity in the kind of midteen area and just reflective that it wont make quite as much net interest income this year but still investing in the things to position us to have a good kind of runway into erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you ill let one of my peers ask more detail on the swap recalibration because i think thats important as we think about nii for but since we have you bruce i want to ask you about how youre thinking about these anticipated regulatory changes for regional banks im glad that you said in the prepared remarks that it takes time right you have the npr which could come out end of the year or a year from now a year of comment period then a phase in so as we think about what the market is anticipating whether its tlac or getting rid of opt out on aoci and of course you said youre already lcr compliant how are you thinking about managing your capital relative to your stocks down ph at time right and it seems like banks can never buyback as much of the time when they should be buying back and the potential in for some nonbanks to be in bigger trouble and potentially taking market share but balancing that with whats going to be potentially tighter requirements on capital and liquidity how much are you frontloading that versus thinking about the opportunities that can come your way if you remain as profitable as you say youre going to remain citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah great question and i guess just to set the big picture erika that i would say first off i dont believe that the answer to the two bank failures is more regulation on regional banks i think those were idiosyncratic situations and there was sufficient regulation so you basically had business models that were not well diversified and the banks grew too fast and stretched management capabilities supervisors didnt really do their job and so i think therell be a thoughtful review of what were the issues and then how to address them i think its probable that there will be some tightening around liquidity and capital and probably closer reviews of how banks are handling their asset liability management there may be other aspects of this in terms of the overnight repo facility and creating a viable drain on bank deposits and the money funds and should they change that and deposit insurance and should they take a look at that so theres a bunch of things i think will come under review specifically with respect to us i think the good news is that weve managed our capital at the high end of our peer group and so were already compliant we would be if we ended up having the aoci filter removed wed be in compliance today the same thing john pointed out the lcr weve run that at a high level we run very rigorous internal liquidity stress testing regiment that wed already be in compliance with the category iii bank as well so the fact that we have managed the balance sheet conservatively were already in compliance if they go kind of heavier regulation if that ends up going down that path i think were in good position so i think we will have and the fact that these will be phased in over kind of id say two years or three years gives us lots of capital flexibility to be buying back our stock or taking advantage of other situations where that could arise and if its strategically and financially compelling i think we have the capability to go on offense so anyway thats kind of my thoughts on that it was good to kind of stay conservative even when we had lots of questions as to why arent you leveraging your capital structure more why are you keeping your cet1 target so high guess what we keep it that way and weve run conservative for precisely these air pockets that youre always going to experience turbulence and high capital and high liquidity is your best friend in these circumstances erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of peter winter with da davidson your line is open peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning i wanted to just follow up on erikas question on the nii guide i was wondering could you be a little bit more specific on the outlook for margin and loan trends going forward john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and get started on that so the guide being up to what we built into that as we mentioned is the fact that were going to have some downward kind of impact on margin coming from the deposit citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 migration as well as increased beta assumptions that were building in so theres a lot of uncertainty here and a lot of things to play out but to try to frame it a little bit go out if you think about where we may in where we may in the year were starting the year at we may in the year call it in a wide range maybe to and if things kind of if theres good execution and some trends maybe end up going our way well end up at the high end of that range and vice versa on the lower end and then so id say that when you think about playing it out throughout the year therell be a step down as you work through the year with maybe a little bit of weighting into and things basically flattening out into the second half of the year but like i said theres a lot of uncertainty there and but that helps hopefully that will help give you a frame and then youve got as we mentioned on the volume side of things we do have the auto rundown which we began last year that will be is built into that guide as well as the ongoing work that were doing in commercial and balance sheet optimization so and you put all that together and that gives you the nii guidance bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just add to that good answer john this is an opportunity weve always been on balance sheet optimization path but i think were really intensifying our focus there so businesses like indirect auto where it was a good place to kind of park liquidity and we run the business well we are servicing very well but its not really that strategically important to us it doesnt have direct customers that we crosssell to because those customers frankly are customers of the dealerships so looking hard at those business and say hey if deposits are more dear what do we have on the left side of our balance sheet where we dont have deep relationships and were not making the best risk adjusted returns and so during this year i think were going to really focus on making sure that the right side of the balance sheet in terms of deposit quality is as strong as it possibly can be and that where were lending money were doing that to true customers that we have deep relationships whether theyre consumers small business or commercial and so well take the opportunity this year to potentially have a little bit of a reset and even intensify those efforts so well really love our balance sheet going into peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it and if i could just ask about deposits the outlook i recognize deposits stabilized in march and youve done a lot of work to improve the deposit franchise but it just seems like in this environment to keep deposits stable to growing deposits from here could be a little bit of a challenge not only for you and i was wondering if you could just give us some color on some of the deposit opportunities bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah why dont i start at the top and then maybe ill turn it to brendan and don to talk about what were doing in consumer and commercial we did put a slide in there peter about some of those opportunities and so i think that right now we just need to kind of get through this earnings season and see the cards turned over and continue the trend hopefully of less and less turbulence and getting back to a more calm situation so thats where kind of stability comes in and by the way through halfway through april were still kind of trending stable to even slightly up but then the initiatives that we have long invested in and the value propositions that we have both for consumer and some citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 of the new innovation we have on the commercial side we think should start to play out and then we can start to build back deposits but why dont i first turn it to brendan to talk about consumer brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks so the consumer in the consumer business youve got sort of kind of three segments of deposits the traditional retail wealth management and then small business and its kind of progressing as expected these have been in chatting mode over the last couple of quarters we certainly have customers coming into the cycle that have excess deposits and liquidity from precovid were seeing very very small earn down rates but nothing that is unexpected and broadly right in line with trends from midsummer last year through this quarter as john pointed out through march on all three of those portfolios we saw to increase in inflows but the same sort of increase on outflow is broadly just moving money around and so we were very stable on net balances across those businesses through the month of march we feel really good about the underlying health over the last eight years weve invested a lot of time and energy in making our consumer deposit base much more granular our primacy rate so whether customers consider us a primary bank or not is up dramatically to above peer levels thats a good thing that means stability in low cost deposits when payroll is coming in weve done things like added benefits like early pay for consumers which is an encouragement to bring payroll and direct deposit over thats going quite well it adds more granularity and stability of the deposit base and when i look at levers to continue to have strong deposit performance for the rest of the year theres a couple of things in the consumer bank that were really really focused on one john mentioned new york city new jersey household growth getting more customers that is going well were performing at the top end of our peer set in terms of net market share gain and household growth we expect that to continue in all of our markets and supported by the really early momentum in new york city in new jersey that we expect to continue weve also made a pretty meaningful pivot into a customer relationship deepening so weve rolled out program as bruce mentioned citizensplus which the simple concept is you do more with us you get more really encouraging customers to bring more of their wallet to us weve seen very very strong take up on that a plus improvement in customers going into these relationship propositions encouraged by the breadth of the offering and bringing more to us and profitability of those customers almost doubles when they migrate up so we think that will give us a shot in the arm as customers look at us to consolidate relationships over and then maybe last would be citizens access so it gives us a great lever to raise deposits as we need it but it also gives us a great lever to cost contain interest bearing deposits in the consumer bank which will allow us to have a much more manageable betas in the core bank where we can focus on relationship banking and not deposit raising for the sake of deposit raising and where we need to contain deposit growth we can do it in a very targeted way through citizens access thats proven to be exceptionally effective for us and weve had a great quarter in growing citizens access here in q1 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and don citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island and so on our side i think a lot of it surrounds the payments and treasury services business youve heard us talk for the last couple of years about the investment were making in that business it has not only been around the core operating services but also a lot of work around deposit franchises and liquidity franchises frankly one of the things we havent talked about is we have a liquidity advisory service and a liquidity portal which goes beyond deposits but allows us to capture customer funds even if they are on balance sheet and on the deposit side over the last couple of years weve introduced five or six new products we talked about the green deposits we talked about carbon offset deposits we talked about escrow deposits so the product set is quite broad the other thing we saw during the disruptions is we added about new deposit clients a lot of which interestingly came out of the jmp franchise as they referred some of the technology customers onto our platform some of those are funded up some of those arent funded up but like brendan said the core of our franchise is really the primary core relationships and the operating relationships and about of our deposit base is really with core primary relationships and the last thing were doing is weve turned the deposit business into a primary crosssell so where we were asking for capital markets business when the capital markets were open were now asking for deposits and were framing the deposit rates in the context of our overall relationship and have gotten a very good response from a lot of our clients bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thats great thank you for the detailed answer bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the questions bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 i was hoping you might be able to speak at sort of a top level about how commercial customers are behaving now with their operational deposits like are they keeping less in operational deposits than they would have previously and then just spreading that money across several banks which would imply maybe you lose some but gain some in other words higher return bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co and maybe a thought what commercial account openings have looked like over the past month or so bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah as i mentioned weve opened about new accounts over the last month which has been encouraging id say at the top end of the client base weve seen more diversification activity so the public companies which had excess deposits kicking in around the system some of which were surge deposits some of those flowed out and went to other banks and then on the flip side some of them flowed into us as customers balance their deposit accounts to kind of net neutral on that and then the other thing we see frankly and this was far before svb and some of the disruption is clients are because the capital markets are kind of quiet and the lending markets are kind of quiet clients are using some of their cash to fund their operations and fund capex so weve seen a little bit of a drift out in terms of just utilization of excess cash balances and then id say the core operating deposits have stayed pretty flat i mean people are basically toggling between ecr and deposits if theres a toggle but id say the kind of core funding of operational activities is relatively flat r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and sorry i had missed that accounts over the last month but i appreciate all that color and then maybe separately sounds like you had some fairly constructive comments about the possibility for investment banking to recover over the course of the year maybe in the second half just maybe a little more color on how youre expecting things to traject from here please donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think well see its going to depend on what happens in the marketplace i will say that over the last couple weeks weve seen a pretty strong bid in a lot of different asset classes particularly the syndicated loan underlying asset class so theres some signs of life in the market whereas it was dead quiet at the beginning of the year were starting to see some transactions actually clear the market some and kind of and some get restructured in ways that are i would say not more aggressive but more regular way from very structured transactions that were happening over the last couple months so good signs of life citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 id say our pitch activity and our pipelines are extremely robust and i would come back to what i said a couple times is in things like our ma business were a middle market investment bank and so we play in smallersized transactions say million to billion not the billion to billion transaction so the financing dependency thats in a lot of our pipelines is not as difficult as it is for the mega transaction so we think as things begin to stabilize and recover and the rate cycle begins to come to an end well see activity in the second half of the year and were seeing that in our pipelines and then remember we also have a very diverse set of capabilities now so were doing a lot around private equity were doing meaning placing equity for clients into for example a family office or a lot of pitch activity around convertible bonds so while some traditional fullmarket products might not be fully back yet we have a wide arsenal that were actually deploying on behalf of the bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and let me just add to that as well and maybe flip it to john but scott the fee guide is supported i think broadly not reliant just on capital markets coming back so we have a positive outlook across card across wealth the cash management business mortgage market so its fairly broad donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me just add one more thing bruce so if the first quarter is a indication we were down about million quarteronquarter in syndicated finance we were up about million in our interest rate products and commodities hedging businesses so diversification of those fee streams to bruces point is quite important bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah just picking up on that so i was going to make that exact point just in terms of the bond and equity diversification along with ma and cap markets but in terms of card i mean we do see some positive outlook in card as well primarily in the credit card space in mortgage production volumes and margin is starting to recover a bit and thats really good to see after quite a few quarters with headwinds there and then on the wealth side of things that has just been steady for us and is continuing even early april activity has been quite strong and so were feeling good in the wealth space so its sort of diversified across four five categories in terms of what were seeing for the outlook r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you very much operator your next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc one moment please were having a technical difficulty mr cassidy your line is open you may proceed citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi bruce hi john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john you talked about lowering the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet can you share with us how quickly you can take that to neutral if you wanted to as the rate environment shifts possibly toward the second half of the year and then also the cost or the strategies you would use to do that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean so the way to think about that is were pretty close to neutral now and when youre down around there are a number of assumptions that go into that calculation including deposit migration et cetera and so if your models are off one way or the other you could easily be neutral and we think about that when we consider the fact that we have a view that the fed may hike one more time and may be on hold but if inflation is more persistent and stubborn things could rise right from here so we nevertheless dont try to overcook things one way or the other but gradually getting back to neutral has served us well and also you have to think about that split between whats typically hedgeable and what is a little less hedgeable and the short end is more hedgeable so the construct of what the short rate exposure is is actually less than were actually skewed towards the short end so to close that down would not take very much at all it would be typically a shift in balance sheet outlook andor additional receive fixed swaps but more broadly we basically layered on a number of transactions to basically get our coverage for the rest of weve got about billion of coverage and receive fixed swaps for the rest of and more like billion or so for and so were sort of thinking of ourselves around neutral with protection to the downside and i would offer up that that will result if in fact the fed does have to lower rates by a lot we have a view that well end up with a trough nim thats well above what we saw in our last cycle so much more stable and a much more narrow corridor of net interest margin than you might have seen from us in the past gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and bruce i like the branding youre doing in new york with the giants looking forward to the day that citizens becomes the bank of the yankees so with that as a followup on retail this is maybe for brendan you guys gave us really good detail on slide on the fico scores and theres a theory out there i dont know if citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 its true or not that the fico scores have been inflated because of what we came through during the pandemic some people claim as much as points do you guys buy into that theory and if so would you then expect maybe the behaviors of your customers to be different than what the actual fico scores are brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah great question yeah there is a theory out there that fico scores were inflated with all the stimulus and delinquency going down really really fast the good news is our credit underwriting is fairly sophisticated and while fico is an input it tends to be run on about things that we look at including free cash flow and a whole bunch of other different metrics in all of our businesses and so weve taken that into account in our underwriting the range of real ficos versus actual printed ficos during covid was incorporated into all of our credit metrics as we kind of made new loans over the last three or four years so we feel l really good about that and i think the performance is showing that that we think so far at least we got that right and as john pointed out we are seeing the consumer both normalize by both delinquency and chargeoffs are still south of where they were precovid and were not seeing an unexpected acceleration of delinquency or chargeoffs given the environment really across any of the asset classes so and over the years there has been questions about some of the businesses that were faster growing in consumer and unsecured like student and our citizens pay better business those are well under control despite the great clouds surrounding us so we feel really good about where we stand right now for consumer credit given the health of the consumer and the quality of our underwriting standards and yet lastly yeah weve tightened a bunch in the last six to nine months just as a cautionary measure so as were kind of tightening up on things like auto on just size of balance sheet around the fringes and almost every single one of our asset classes weve made credit tightenings not because were seeing anything we dont like just in an abundance of caution to make sure that we dont have any tail risk in any of the portfolio so as everything we can see right now we feel pretty good gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate the color thank you operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is open go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the expense side i think bruce you had alluded to potentially being able to come in below the expense expectation the expectation maybe for the year as youre focusing on that given the top line pressures can you maybe give us a little more color there what youre looking at and how material of a potential benefit you could have on that front as you see the top line pressure building on the nii side bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 yeah ill start and flip to john but we had coming into the year we were going with a guide some of that was reflective of the hsbc and isbc full year effects and then some was the higher fdic premiums weve marked that down to so clearly in recognition that well have some compression in the net interest income were going to work really hard to try to protect the bottom line and so i think thats what weve circled at this point clearly top remains an open program and we have lots of ideas in terms of are there other things that we can try to get working on and actually have a benefit this year some of them may actually have a benefit for next year but certainly weve got our folks taking a hard look at what else we can do on the expense side but at the same time were trying to make sure that we protect all of the investments in our future the important strategic initiatives across consumer and commercial across technology and our overall client experience organization so that when the storm clouds pass were growing faster than peers and were in good position to grow both the customer base as well as our revenues so thats the balancing act is to keep looking for efficiencies while making sure that were prioritizing the things that really are important to future positioning john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats well said i would just add that we try to calibrate our expense base along with the revenue base thats being projected here and so i think you could very well see an upsize in top in the coming months were working on that the couple of areas that were thinking about expanding on is the further simplification of our operating models all of our weve taken a look at a harder look at all of our thirdparty spend reimagining how we operate from an automation perspective is something thats structurally weve been making investments in and we can double down on that going forward and just making sure everything were doing is absolutely focused on our core objectives of growing a top performing bank generating low moderate cost deposits and investing in our customers and clients and so when you put a sharp eye on all of that you often come up with opportunities to basically create additional efficiencies and weve demonstrated that over the years and then were going to intensify those efforts here in the coming months john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thank you then just secondly on the commercial real estate front can you give us a couple stats that you may have on that in terms of as youre looking at refreshing or reappraising some of the properties in office can you give us what youre seeing in terms of some of the value declines we had a peer of yours indicate to value declines in some of the office reappraisals and then separately i know you indicated that youre seeing some pressure you expect pressure on commercial real estate criticized loans do you have what the percentage increase was in commercial real estate criticized and whats the ratio donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island general criticized is running at about for the office space i dont have it for the overall real estate bucket at the time but office is what were very focused on we havent seen a lot of appraisals yet because were not really in the restructuring mode the ones weve seen have actually been modestly better than we expected i dont have the exact downdraft but our entry ltvs are around so theres a lot of cushion in our underwriting of commercial real estate citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2023 as bruce and john said weve really staffed up our workout teams and were really putting each individual property each individual msa under the microscope were focused on maturities in the office but we have about of the book maturing by the end of so its not a huge amount and we have a majority of the risk in the book swapped or fixed in terms of interest rate protection so while were beginning to engage client by client remember the way were very smooth were very kind of focused on who were doing business with so client selection is very important msa is very important suburban versus urban is very important and so we think well have some trouble in the book and were going to have to restructure a lot of the transactions its going to be very manageable in terms of the overall loss content john pancari q analyst evercore isi very helpful thank you operator due to time constraints we will now turn the call back over to mr van saun bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer
