gary will discuss further all these accomplishments led to a very successful and we will build upon the strong momentum in with that ill ask gary to comment on credit quality gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone we had a solid fourth quarter to close out with key credit metrics remaining at favorable levels that are tracking consistent with our expectations and remain very pleased with the current position of our portfolio as we move into as you are aware the new accounting standard for current expected credit losses became effective on january which not only brings changes to reserve methodology under the standard but also marks the end of the prior methodology to account for loans acquired in a business combination therefore i will be focusing a majority of my commentary today on our allin gaap credit results for the total loan portfolio ill also provide a brief update on the performance of our originated and acquired portfolios to provide a few highlights of how these two books performed lets now cover the total portfolio results the level of delinquency on a gaap basis ended december at basis points up bps over the prior quarters historically low levels the longterm trend continues to track in a positive manner as the current period showed a 13basispoint improvement over the prior year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 npls and oreo trended similarly up a few bps over very good q3 levels to stand at basis points with year overyear results improving by basis points these longterm positive trends are the result of our continued focus on moving criticized assets off the books to better position the portfolio and we were very successful doing so in q4 its worth noting that beginning in q1 acquired loans will be reported as nonaccrual when they no longer accrue interest as is consistent with the shift from the prior purchase accounting standard to cecl a majority of these acquired credits are presently reported in the 90plus past due category regardless of the accounting treatment we will continue to focus on our current strategy of attentive and proactive workout of these subscriber performing assets as it relates to loan loss performance gaap net chargeoffs remained at solid levels totaling million for the quarter or basis points annualized to end the full year at million or basis points the provision at million for the quarter and million for the full year adequately covered chargeoffs and loan growth for these periods vince calabrese will provide some additional commentary on the reserve and cecl during his prepared remarks ill now briefly touch on the originated and acquired portfolios to provide some comparative results against the prior quarter the level of delinquency for the originated book ended december at basis points up bps linked quarter while npls and oreo increased bps to stand at basis points originated net chargeoff levels for the fourth quarter were solid at bps annualized ending december at million with fullyear net chargeoffs totaling million or basis points our acquired portfolio also continues to perform in line with our expectations with contractual delinquency levels continuing to trend favorably marked by a million reduction yearoveryear representing a decrease as we close out another successful year we are pleased with the positioning of the portfolio and our solid and consistent credit results across all books of business the longterm consistency and stability in our portfolio are proof points of the disciplined approach we take in our credit and lending decisioning processes none of which would be possible without our experienced team of bankers across the entire footprint as we move ahead to the new year and the changes the cecl accounting standard brings we remain committed to maintaining our core credit principles to help balance growth objectives with our desired asset mix and risk profile at this later stage of the economy looking back we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio throughout the whole year and are looking forward to the business opportunities ahead of us in i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary and good morning today i will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and provide guidance for as noted on slide sic slide fourth quarter operating eps totaled bringing fullyear operating eps to an increase of over as vince previously mentioned the tce ratio is at the highest level in nearly two decades the tangible book value per share is also at its highest level over the same period at per share these numbers demonstrate our focus on providing meaningful shareholder value while maintaining favorable asset quality lets start with a review of the balance sheet for the fourth quarter on slide linkedquarter average loan growth totaled million or annualized attributable to commercial growth of and consumer growth of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 focusing on spot yearend balances relative to total loans have increased over billion or spot commercial growth of was led by a million increase in ci balances as commercial real estate also saw good activity on the origination side that was impacted by continued paydowns in that space spot consumer growth of was driven by increases in residential mortgages of and direct installment loans of partially offset by a decline in home equity line of credit balances continuing on slide on a linkedquarter basis average deposits grew annualized the annualized growth in interestbearing deposits of and noninterestbearing deposits of was partially offset by an anticipated decline in time deposits with a nearly million decline in brokered cd balances the shift from time to interestbearing deposits allows more flexibility in managing costs in a changing rate environment turning to the income statement on slide net interest income totaled million a decline of from last quarter as the net interest margin narrowed basis points to recognizing the interest rate environment impact is not unique to us the rate cut taking place early in the quarter clearly had an impact on variable rate loan yields and the net interest margin specifically with one month libor down another basis points in the fourth quarter the net interest margin declined slightly more than expected compared to the third quarter onemonth libor fell basis points in october alone which pressured asset yields from the beginning of the quarter we were able to partially mitigate some of the decline as interestbearing deposit costs improved basis points on an average basis and basis points on a spot basis while we saw deposit costs lagged the movedown in libor in october relative to variable rate loan yields we are confident that our deposit rates at the end of december will help support the net interest margin as we move through furthermore we have consumer promotional deposits repricing in february and the anticipated decline in interestbearing deposit costs we expect will support gradual net interest margin expansion we expect a relatively stable net interest margin next quarter and then expect gradual margin expansion throughout the rest of the year slides and provide details for noninterest income and expense there continues to be strong performance in mortgage banking capital markets and trust income and operating noninterest income as a whole as vince noted earlier we are extremely pleased with our record feebased results in which significantly exceeded our expectations and importantly mitigated the interest rate movements we experienced looking at the fourth quarter noninterest income totaled million a decrease from last quarter due mainly to the impact from service charge refunds called out on the side on an operating basis noninterest income was down from a record level in the third quarter as we saw strong results from capital markets and mortgage banking income offset by lower gains on sales of real estate and lower results on our sbic investment turning to slide noninterest expense remained relatively flat over the third quarter on a core basis when removing the million item related to the renewable energy investment tax credit from last quarter noninterest expenses rose due to higher outside professional services strategic technology investments in software and equipment and normal merit increases and incentive payout accruals for the strong performance expense management remains a top priority and we are very pleased that we held core expenses relatively flat compared to lastly id like to reaffirm our previously disclosed expected capital impact of the cecl adoption for last quarter we disclosed the estimated day increase to our allowance for credit losses of to for the fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 originated loan portfolio with the related capital impacts expected to range from to basis points of tce and range from to basis points of cet regulatory capital on a fully phasedin basis as a reminder the cecl transition on the acquired portfolio results in a balance sheet grossup of loans and allowance with no capital impact once the day cecl allowance is established on the acquired portfolio the remaining credit and noncredit marks of million to million on these loans are accreted into interest income prospectively over the remaining life of the portfolio the recognition of this accretion is similar to our current process except that the remaining marks or discounts are maintained at the loan level as opposed to loan pools we expect the overall allowance coverage ratio to be to using numbers now i would like to provide guidance for midsingledigit fullyear spot loan and deposit growth ill note our rate outlook reflects a stable yield curve outlook with no additional fed moves in and for onemonth libor rates to remain at the levels they were at the end of december all comparison is on a yearoveryear basis compared to reported results for the base year net interest income noninterest income and noninterest expense are all expected to increase in the lowsingle digits provision expense is expected to be in the million to million range which includes the impact of cecl effective tax rate of to which includes some level of income tax credits weve experienced over the last few years with that ill turn the call over to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks vince last january we covered major tenants of the longterm strategy and i want to provide an update throughout we continue to focus our efforts on optimizing our online and

work and dedication for a successful we are wellpositioned for a great and well continue to serve our constituencies actively engage with the communities invest in our dedicated employees and deliver greater shareholder value fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper jaffray sic piper sandler frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just wanted to start with the really strong growth in demand in the quarter could you guys talk a little bit about what allowed you i know you the thinking was to reduce the planned reduction in the brokered cd levels but what allowed you to grow demand as you did was there some promotions in there and then what are your thoughts for do you think youll continue to see this sort of mix shift in vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania now weve done a number of things to drive demand deposit growth i think weve talked about it in the past i know each quarter this year weve had pretty decent increases we engage our team with incentive compensation directly geared towards driving that category thats one of the primary categories in the consumer scorecard and its based upon output not activity so growth and balance sheet thats one thing that we do we support that activity with data analytics and leads we have a pretty robust calling effort in the municipal space and with our corporate bankers from a treasury management perspective so we see good solid growth in the commercial demand deposit balances simply because theyre being used to support services we talk a lot about the other fee income categories but weve had significant growth in treasury management fee income across the company and particularly in the southeast and the midatlantic and the newer markets weve entered so thats all helped and it continues to help and weve continued to see good solid growth and that was one of the pillars that we focused on to help mitigate margin compression this year fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 we mentioned it called it out in the annual report letter and it was a focus of the company so everybody did a great job of executing there but there were a number of areas that we focused on to drive that frank it wasnt one silver bullet frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then but do you think for youll continue to see that sort of trend vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we do frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies stronger growth in demand vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania we do were going to continue to focus on shifting that mix bringing the deposit costs down to help offset the margin impact vince as vince mentioned in the guidance we expect because of a stable and steeper yield curve we expect margin to improve slightly over the course of the year our goal is to hopefully do better than that by focusing on that mix within our funding base and our people are very skilled at going after those deposits and we use a variety of tools to help them gain that market share so that should be a focus and should continue to help us frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then kind of just on operating leverage i just want to make sure im thinking about it correctly and you guys obviously gave guidance and a bunch of line items so we can plug that into our models but just wondering as you think about in you saw a positive operating leverage yearoveryear it seems to me just given where you ended the year where the margin was in versus the beginning of the year thats going to be a pretty tough ask for to put up yearoveryear positive operating leverage in so is the thinking more so that youll youre just the goal is to move the efficiency ratio for down from levels or do you think you can get a positive operating leverage again yearoveryear vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i would the guidance definitely has positive operating leverage in it frank for i mean i would say as you would expect it was more challenging to get there for than just given the rate environment that weve all experienced but within our plan we dont go to the board without having positive operating leverage so revenues growing faster than expenses maybe not by a lot but its growing faster than expenses and we can manage the expense side of that as we do we had initiatives in to take out a significant chunk of expenses and we just have that as part of running a company and we have similar efforts going on in to ensure that we do have positive operating leverage and then if we get any surprises in yield curve as far as fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 additional steepness that obviously helps the cause beyond what we have baked into the plan but within our guidance is positive operating leverage frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies for yearoveryear vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania close to indiscernible of the fourth quarter frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah ph fullyear frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies great thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies thanks vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks frank operator thank you and the next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good morning fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey jared gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi jared vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania how are you jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc good thanks just if we could start with the margin here youre saying that first quarter should be stable with gradual increase thereafter and expecting yearend or onemonth libor to mimic yearend but were already down basis points from yearend on onemonth i guess how does that impact the thoughts for first quarter asset yields and then as we look out over the rest of the year i obviously hear what youre saying on the funding side but do you expect to see any benefit on asset yields from continued remix or is it really is the gradual increase in margin really going to be fundingdriven vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania now i would say a few things libor if you look at the yield curve thats baked into our plan has onemonth libor at at the end of the year in the june as you mentioned the rates lower than that today so we do expect the first quarter to have some slight pressure not the magnitude of what we saw in the fourth quarter and then kind of builds gradually from there if you look at the 10year rate thats in our plan its by the end of the year and again this is largely using the bloomberg economist surveys and you got a twoyear around at the end of the year so i think that kind of gives you some indication of whats in there and if libor moves back as you know onemonth libor is very volatile its been up quite a bit from here and then its come back down so in the short term theres still some pressure there but as i mentioned in my in my comments theres still opportunity on the interestbearing deposit cost side i mentioned the basis points on average we came down on a spot basis its down basis points and when i look ahead to the first quarter we should have the average costs down another to basis points in the first quarter so that obviously would help to support kind of the margin being relatively stable in the first quarter i think that the all the components feed into it as you mentioned the commercial growth being the strongest component of our growth those are loans that are tied to onemonth libor largely and you get the benefit of the rates as they move up there so i mean all the moving parts are kind of whats baked in there given the guidance that we have on the loan and deposit growth so but clearly with onemonth libor where it is it puts a little bit of pressure in that first quarter jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 and then on whats the expectation for purchase accounting accretion in vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well except the range that we gave in october for cecl so million to million that will be accreted in kind of on a loanbyloan basis going forward so its that over some average life period whether its three or four years but its really a loanbyloan so as prepayments come in youll get benefits of that faster accretion if prepayments are slower youll get slower accretion but thats kind of a pool once were in cecl mode thats going to get accreted in over time jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and what about just the just from the pure interest rate marks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thats all in now jared thats the way its all in that number jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so the total marks and remaining discounts are within that million to million pool jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it shifting over to the fee income side obviously great quarter for mortgage banking what are your expectations for that i guess in your outlook i mean im guessing that thats going to pull back and were going to see offset growth in the other lines continuing through the year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a couple of things on the noninterest income guidance i mean the overall lowsingle digits is based on lower gains on sale of real estate we had some gains this year we were able to move some properties off the balance sheet at a gain and then lower capital markets revenue coming off a record year in that benefited from the rate volatility helping the cause so that kind of two key components to that low single digits and then the other components are kind of growing service charges in the lowsingle digits the other categories are kind of mid to high some of our nonbanking businesses are in that right around doubledigits growth mortgage banking is kind of midsingle digits growth expected in versus so not as strong as versus but still pretty good level in those midsingle digits fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just finally for me down in the carolinas are you starting to see any early opportunities from some of the larger deals that have taken place the suntrust bbt as well as sort of the first horizon ibkc deal opportunities for additional hiring or customer acquisition vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well on the customer side weve certainly seen a change in attitude by the customer i mean were getting opportunities to have meetings and discuss opportunities i think in the past some of these prime borrowers would not open themselves up to that but i think the uncertainty has created opportunities to at least interface which is positive i dont think with those two mergers were at a point yet where the customers are feeling pain because they havent really finalized assignments they havent integrated systems theyre still going through all that so were still in a period of uncertainty but of course i think any disruption that exists in the marketplace given that were fully staffed and we have our stake in the market and were wellestablished i think were going to see opportunities particularly with the quality of the people weve been able to bring over on the employee side weve always had opportunities to hire people from larger institutions weve mentioned that repeatedly weve done a pretty good job of changing out some of the bankers and really upgrading in certain circumstances with people who have long tenures in the market who come from larger organizations thats going to continue to be the case irrespective of whether theres disruption but certainly that helps us as well and well see opportunities to meet and speak with people were nearly fully staffed theres only a handful of positions open in the southeast but if the opportunity came up to hire a highperforming banker we would certainly move on that opportunity gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania jared as vince mentioned those opportunities with that particular merger well continue as the combination gets integrated we have seen over the last lets say to months new business opportunities that weve already put on the books from that transition as well so we have generated some new customers that are already on the books based on their concerns about the size of that and who was going to handle their credit relationship so we have seen positive benefit we do expect to see more jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from michael young with suntrust michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi michael michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc i wanted to start on the capital front the tceta ratio finally got about i think you guys have been articulating the potential for some capital returns potentially share buyback after we kind of get through with cecl is that still the outlook and what capital levels are you targeting in this sort of environment vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say as you guys know weve been working really hard over many years to reach a point where the dividend payout ratio is an acceptable level and we have enjoyed that nice build tce ratio and tangible book value as weve gone through the year regarding the share repurchase activity as you mentioned well see the full impact of cecl by the end of the first quarter so right now purchases will kind of continue to be in that opportunistic mode doing things like repurchasing shares for the shares that you need for incentive plan purposes and those types of things in the short term in an opportunistic depending on stock price valuations as weve said before were not going to just build capital for the sake of building it and with a solid earnings outlook we think there will be good opportunity to repurchase shares more programmatically to optimize the capital position as we get further in the year and get kind of past cecl on the books we think the stock is well below intrinsic value and well closely monitor the economics and earnback as we move through the year so depending on where all that looks i would expect to see us become a little more active once were kind of through that cecl period michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and is there a specific capital ratio that you kind of watch as youre thinking about capital deployment vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i mean the tce ratio is a key ratio for us in getting north of the to that weve talked about as an operating range and being north of that is good but theres not a set target were not going to manage it right to on a quarterbyquarter basis but were comfortable at that level and then that gives us the ability to repurchase shares when the opportunity makes sense to do it michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and i just wanted to clarify from the prior questions you had mentioned the plan you delivered included positive operating leverage and even if kind of the macro environment or loan growth or something were to slow you all are committed to generating that on a yearoveryear basis fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thats part of how we run the company vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you very much vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks michael vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks michael operator thank you and the next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc brody preston q analyst stephens inc good morning everyone how are you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brody were good how are you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brody preston q analyst stephens inc doing well thank you want to touch base what percent im sorry if i missed this but what percent of loans are tied to libor and more specifically onemonth libor fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure its billion or of total loans is tied to onemonth libor and then theres another billion or thats tied to prime so those are kind of the two pools that move any time the fed moves brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you for that and when do these loans typically reset is it every days vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its kind of throughout the month vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania most of them are on a most of them are on a onemonth reset gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania right brody preston q analyst stephens inc yeah so various days through the month vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay just wanted to flip over to the average balance sheet so you had some pretty strong average loan growth i think it was plus8 on a linkedquarter annualized basis but relative to the periodend that was only it looks like maybe there were some paydowns towards the end of the quarter maybe consumer and indirect is that fair to say vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania nothing unusual fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah nothing unusual brody i mean you have some shortterm tax instruments that come due at the end of the year and they do pay down right during the last week of the year so you have some impact there we did have one or two cre transactions move into the secondary market so there was some slight impact there right at the end of the year brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay all right but overall you feel pretty comfortable with that midsingledigit balance sheet growth sort of target vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay just wanted to step back to the deposit strength i understand that the noninterestbearing is sort of driven by a lot of different i guess a lot of different items but just from a geographic perspective wondering if you could touch on sort of what drove the strength this quarter vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well our legacy markets continue to perform very well weve had a number of wins across the footprint so there were some significant wins in the southeast in the midatlantic which really helped from a commercial perspective large treasury management customers and overall i mean truthfully its just a very wellmanaged process from top to bottom and weve mentioned the investment in technology that weve made our mobile app is rated very highly by sp global weve invested all along in the infrastructure to use digital analytics and to help equip our sales teams with information we have digital scorecards that we monitor daily that are offered to the retail folks the branch personnel and commercial bankers have scorecards as well so weve spent a lot of time and energy making sure that were managing that process very effectively and we have products and services that are competitive and stack up well against some of the largest competitors in the country thats really why weve been able to drive that demand deposit growth and i know fnb doesnt sound like a technologically advanced bank given the name but weve spent quite a bit of expended quite a bit of our resources both from a personnel and capital expenditure standpoint into providing our people with good products and services and the ability to compete and then measuring that performance has always been a key driver of our success here so fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and the markets weve entered theres a lot of opportunity in those markets vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well the markets weve entered are much more dynamic than the markets were in i mean they grow theres population growth theres business formation we mentioned the thesis when we announced the acquisition we did an extensive study of the markets that we moved into from an ma perspective and we felt that we could compete effectively and i think weve proven that over the last few years and we hope to continue to reap the benefits of our geographic expansion i think it creates a very positive operating environment for us as we move through the cycle brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay great just a couple more from me just wanted to touch on what drove the service charge refund this quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well we would have gone back and evaluated certain transactions related to pre2019 customer activity and determined that we would refund certain service charges to customers its just part of our overall product offerings were continually challenging ourselves internally we analyze customer activity and customer responses just to make sure were taking kind of appropriate steps related to service charges so its really a onetime item it doesnt affect the run rate going forward brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and then the south carolina markets with lens hiring at the investor day you guys had some pretty strong commentary around some of the initial success following his hire and just wanted to sort of touch on what the pipelines look there vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania the pipeline is very strong there weve had some really solid hires len and elizabeth and the team down there have done a great job of attracting talent so we are very optimistic about charleston moving into next year particularly because were going to have a number of locations open and available to our clients by the middle of the year it should be very positive for us and the commercial pipeline is above million and has been so we feel very good about them vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah they hit the ground running really fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania theyve really done a great job brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right then one more if i can just wanted to get a sense just sort of reiterate your thoughts around any potential ma from here as we look forward to and vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think as we look forward were not again were still focused on operating that company that weve established i think were in a great market were going to exploit our position in those markets theres a lot of disruption all around us i think we have significant opportunities to grow organically i think weve done a good job over the last few years of generating positive operating leverage and being very disciplined from an expense perspective but still rooting out opportunities for growth and de novo expansion and investments in technology and were going to continue to do that and weve made some great investments i think the website is going to be rolled out and it will be very wellreceived we shared a demo with a small group of you i think that theres a lot of exciting things coming obviously the interest rate environment is not what we favor or predicted its the opposite of what we predicted but weve always been able to manage through those times and come out the other end with good credit quality and expansion and fee income and a shift in deposit mix which has helped us just like this year and we never would have expected to get where we are this year without the margin help but we got together as a team and we cut expenses we focused on fee income we managed the teams a little tighter in the field to ensure that they produce the demand deposit growth and we came out the other end with a positive outcome i expect that in as well brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right thank you very much everyone vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brody vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from russell gunther with da davidson fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey russell gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania morning russell russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co just a followup on your comments for growth so one i wanted to confirm that the loan growth guide is off of an endofperiod number and then two if you could just comment on sort of loan verticals that youd expect to be drivers of that growth as well as what markets may be stronger sources of strength for you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well ill let vince answer your question on the guide its periodend i believe vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah its periodend vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay so i think from a growth perspective there are a number of areas that weve focused on where weve had great success particularly in the dc area where were focusing on ci in maryland and dc and weve had good solid performance there moving the teams up markets are not necessarily a vertical but focusing on larger opportunities where we can garner additional business as you know weve done extraordinarily well in that space this year with a significant increase in syndication fee derivative opportunities and treasury management fee income i expect that to continue into next year weve only scratched the surface fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 if you look at the cre space we have a number of large projects that were evaluating were very careful about what we go after because we still feel that credit quality is king and we need to stay focused on our credit appetite not deviate not be tempted to deviate but i think those are two areas of focus manufacturings a little slower its a smaller portion of our portfolio than it has been historically but im expecting that i personally am expecting that to come back around in the latter half of this year principally because of the trade agreements that are being signed and some other positive indicators but i think that there certainly has been a slight contraction there but those are the factors that will drive growth i also believe that were doing a better job in the new markets weve trained those people we spent a lot of money bringing everybody through credit training and bringing everybody through our foundations training and those bankers in particular are much more skilled and able to source small business opportunities we expect sba to do better this year they have a significant pipeline so really that will be more of a fee income event but still on the credit side we also expect small business in general across the footprint to perform better weve made some changes there so there are a number of areas where we can produce growth and if you remember were one of the few banks regional banks our size that has the geographic dispersion and the concentration in those attractive markets so for us to be in charlotte raleigh the piedmont triad baltimore pittsburgh cleveland washington dc that gives us the ability to go after a large number of prospects and achieve our growth objectives without changing our risk appetite so theres plenty of opportunities for us to go after and theres a lot of disruption across that entire area thats the strategy on the growth side from a loan perspective russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co no thats great color vince i appreciate it and my last question as a followup guys would be i guess just sort of big picture does the growth outlook contemplate a reduction in kind of elevated paydowns that were a headwind for or for that environment to stay relatively the same would just be curious as to whats baked in vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes it wasnt really payoffs in it was predetermined sales we sold a large mortgage portfolio i think it was million right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah three change vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so there were some things that we did that were intentional and made good financial sense going into a cecl environment so were staying disciplined and focused on making good decisions i think if you look back at the prior year we sold a number of distressed assets that we had acquired we moved out over million and we sold regency finance so weve created an environment you saw the chargeoffs this quarter our credit quality was pristine so i think were given how were positioned going into this cycle we should continue to benefit from good solid credit quality as well fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 but thats those were the headwinds where they were selfimposed and i truly believe having been in this business for years that we cant just reach for growth we have to be disciplined thats the trap that everybody falls in and thats why we expanded so aggressively geographically so that we would have the opportunity to achieve our investment thesis without changing the risk profile anyway indiscernible gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey russell just one additional comment as it relates to cre we do expect the secondary market activity to continue throughout the year it has slowed from its tepid very strong pace back in and early but that activity continues and we expect it will continue through as well russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co very good vince gary thank you very much thats all i have vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks russell russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks guys good morning vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi collyn vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hi collyn fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just one quick last question just on the loan growth i know vince you had mentioned kind of the outlook for mortgage banking in your fee commentary but just curious how youre kind of thinking about the balance for resi mortgage growth in your outlook for vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania its in that midsingle digits kind of probably mid to highsingle digits i would say its whats kind of baked into the overall midsingle digits and we may do another sale in the second half of the year similar to what we did this year for cecl if you have jumbo mortgage loans where theres only a single product in the household and over a certain period of time if we could not able to expand that relationship we would consider doing something like that again later this year so thats kind of baked into the overall kind of midsingle digit guidance too collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just now that youre kind of in these more robust markets whats the split that youre seeing between refi and purchase overall in your resi mortgage business vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well it vary quite a bit this year as you would expect given the interest rate movements in the fourth quarter was purchase it was the quarter before so you had some kind of additional refi activity coming through just given where rates were so i mean normally were more in that to kind of purchase activity in kind of a normal state collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats all i had thanks guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks collyn gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks collyn vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 operator thank you and the next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just two things for me most have been covered but just on baked in the loan growth vince just the i know its midsingle digits i guess when you look at the ci which is a component of the margin and the benefit can does ci growth this year in your expectations grow a little bit more than that midsingle digit to kind of help on the margin is that kind of how youre thinking about it or is it fair to think thats just more singledigit just in line with the actual guide vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would say its in line with the guide vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania i dont brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah and our is hope that we beat the guide but thats where our best estimate as we sit today is so fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc right okay in the pipeline today vince you said i guess maybe you said it and i missed it but just kind of where its at today the commercial pipeline vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i didnt give total pipeline information i mentioned charleston was still at or above million in commercial pipeline brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that was still very solid brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc i guess are you able to give any commentary on just either the commercial pipeline vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well the only thing i will well the only thing i will tell you is that in production we talked about production but theres an unfunded component to our production calculation because we give people credit for commitments a certain percentage of credit but when you look at the production coming out of the southeast for example i think its up what yearoveryear vince is that right vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah that sounds right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so weve had some good solid growth in terms of the number of transactions that we booked now there is things paying off and the portfolio is moving but we had some very very solid activity in the southeast this past year we expect that to continue and the pipelines overall are pretty comparable to where theyve been historically at this time so we that gives us the confidence to forecast midsingle digit growth brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thats helpful and just the other only other thing for me was just on the expense guide i guess have you guys can you comment on the just operation redi or just kind of what you guys have in there for branch fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 reduction this year i guess is there something baked in this year on the branch reduction side or how should we think about that vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would say a couple of things i mean our guidance of lowsingle digits for reflects the kind of investments in several strategic initiatives that weve been talking about the clickstobricks scenario the website that vince commented so we have continued investment as you know thats part of running the company were always investing every year new branch teller platform de novo expansion so those initiatives are all kind of baked into it on the kind of the increased expense side and then we have continued discipline expense management to help fund those investments and deliver the positive operating leverage and again thats something that we can control the cost management initiative side includes that the redi we continue looking at optimizing the retail network including continuation of the normal kind of redi activities that we have each year continued vendor renegotiations facility optimization how were managing cash in the vaults and on and on i mean theres a long list of kind of initiatives that we have in the company that were working on brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so there are some in there just i guess is how to think about it indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no theres definitely some additional optimization opportunities in the branches for this year brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay all right thats all i had guys thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2020 operator thank you and next is another question from michael young with suntrust michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for the followup vince c just wanted to ask if weve kind of had a period of rising rates where people were locking in duration and extending duration on the funding side and then weve kind of gone the other way obviously over the last year during this period of kind of more stable rates are you looking to make any shifts structurally within the balance sheet to maybe take advantage of in this kind of period of hopeful stability i guess vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i mean were always looking michael i mean we did opportunistically put some fundings on last year at some very good rates when it made sense to do that and locked in some fundings so i mean our treasury function and our alco function were constantly looking at opportunities i mean we dont have any plans for any major shifts well continue to look at the asset side of the balance sheet in a cecl environment where theres opportunities to maybe create some more shelf space for the commercial loan growth well continue to look at that too so i mean its just part of kind of how we manage the balance sheet ongoing so if theres more good opportunities to do something on either side of the balance sheet well do it michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania all right thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator thank you and that concludes the questionandanswer
