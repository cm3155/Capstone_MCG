all right thank you operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two quick questions one on mexico i know a couple of years back you invested something around billion in the infrastructure there and im wondering is that investment finished completed and is it now in the run rate or does that represent a level of funding that could then come out and pay for other things is it an efficiency opportunity is basically the question mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so yes we did announce an investment a number of years ago we are largely through that i think we got to somewhere probably or somewhere through having deployed that investment what is left does serve as a lever for us that we consider as we take on these decisions and just keep in mind those investments were made in building out enhancing our technology and branches and digital capabilities and the like and so i think theyve certainly been beneficial but we are largely through that and whats left is available to us to toggle as we need to here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then as i flip to the us could you give us an update on where you are with the efforts to drive deposit growth in the us i mean i obviously see that deposit growth was up not only in the us but in international in the quarter but im really kind of honing in here on the consumer side and youd had the announcement around some partnerships with american airlines and with google and so id just like to understand where you are in that strategy and do you think that theres anything that you can do to drive up the consumer deposit growth in the back half of this year and into next mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so weve had very good consumer deposit growth through the quarter i think that we benefited from the investments that weve made in our digital capabilities as youve seen the digital deposit sales grow meaningfully as high as billion as we ended the quarter and we continue to see those benefits play out both in our market and outside of our markets which as you know has been part of our strategy to ensure that were leveraging the breadth of our customer base in cards that has a broader presence in the us than we do in terms of a retail banking footprint and so we continue to see those benefits of the strategy play out some of that is fueled by some of the things that ive mentioned earlier in terms of the stimulus thats out there and the delay in terms of tax payments but nonetheless weve been able to capture upside from both new and existing clients and we expect to continue to do that through the balance of the year id also highlight i know your question was around consumer specifically but i would also highlight that were also seeing very good continued traction on the institutional side in our tts franchise and that growth in many ways is as weve seen and worked very closely with our corporate clients to shore up their liquidity positions whether it was early on where they were drawing on lines or in the quarter where we partnered with those same clients to access the capital markets weve been kind of that partner of choice that flight to quality on both the consumer side in the us and internationally as well as the institutional side citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no i figured that institutional was extremely strong i was just wondering out of that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc is there more room for the consumer to accelerate and kind of move it forward from here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and on the consumer youve seen it in both the us youve seen it in mexico youve seen it in asia weve had strong consumer growth across all of the regions but we are pleased with the growth that were seeing here mike did you want to add something michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes i would just say the other piece betsy is that i think very consistent with what weve spoken about in the past of that billion that mark mentioned twothirds which again is a pretty stable number for us is coming from outside our branch footprint which we obviously play we pay close attention to given our branch model betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc twothirds of the growth in consumer is coming from outside of branch footprint michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc twothirds of the digital growth is coming betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc from outside the branch footprint betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thats great thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks operator your final question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for letting me have my followup questions so just to be clear so you are not guiding for positive operating leverage this year mark because earlier you said expense is flat to down and then you said flat and it sounds like youre i know theres a lot of covid costs that make this a difficult year but so no positive operating leverage this year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah id repeat what i said earlier which is revenues kind of slightly down and expenses flattish right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess and as far as the equities business you guys didnt participate as much as others and help me with this logic i mean you had the corporate drawdowns in march that was replaced with the fixed income markets and now maybe we have a reequification with more equity activities and then one of your competitors showed a lot of pickup in equities you talk about a normalization in capital markets do you expect the equities to improve do you recognize the underperformance is it a timing thing how do you think about that michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sure i would say one is lets kind of break the business into a few different buckets so one i would say that our cash trading performance was good it was strong and i would say that again its early to see but we did not do as well in either of primer delta one prime finance delta one derivatives from an equification perspective if you actually look into our capital markets numbers you see a very strong number in ecm that our ecm business was up on a yearoveryear basis so in terms of the capital raising aspects of it we were quite active in most of the headline deals that were done and so again cash trading okay well see where things come out but not as good performance in derivatives delta one prime finance and a strong performance in terms of ecm mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just a summary question through the course of this call your stock price went down youre underperforming the btx its just one day i know stocks dont read too much into that but there is i think a citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 feeling that im getting that either youre being more maybe realistic pragmatic about the realities of the world out there and that goes back to your mention about the vaccine youre seeing something specific to your franchise that gives you more caution or maybe me and others are just interpreting your comments too negatively and i just say that because when you talk about the revenues the nim was down basis points it still goes lower you talked about the consumer being under pressure less partner payments in retail services icg normalizes ahead tts gets hurt by lower rates you dont have positive operating leverage and expenses the loan losses you have mexico with covid and were only somewhere between containment and stabilization and no buybacks for some time to come so those are all thats a summary of some of the negatives that you had from this call so maybe that was unintentional or maybe that was intentional so this is kind of a last chance to either put some positives on the other side like with digital banking or deposit growth or things like that or to say you know what im actually in the camp where this is going be a long road and maybe you differ from the rest of the world michael louis corbat a chief executive officer director citigroup inc well i would start out mike and say that it is not our intention to be negative i think were all in this together and i would certainly say that the unknowns outweigh the knowns and if somebody has the crystal ball i would love to see it but i think what we are seeing and what weve described coming through four very challenging months as the first half of with revenues up expenses flat our ability to absorb significant reserve builds under the new format of cecl broad scale or wideranging engagement from our clients i think you will continue to see in the numbers as they settle that we continue to take market share weve continued to build capital weve continued to build liquidity and feel very good about where we are and how were going into the second half of the year the unknowns are the unknowns we dont know and that in there were seeing resurgences in places where cases had been down and theyve come back up and the us is uneven and the approaches and the rest of the world have been uneven and so again i would say we go in feeling very wellpositioned against this but we dont want people leaving the call simply thinking that the world is a great place and it is a vshaped recovery its our view that we will see v we will see u we will see w and as an institution we need to be prepared to deal with all of it and i think youve seen across our businesses while in certain areas revenues have been under pressure that weve managed through this very well so far and im really proud of the team in terms of what theyve done but again i dont think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind us and its a rosy path ahead so feel good about where we are the environment is unknown i think the actions weve taken so far have been spot on and i think were wellpositioned for what the future brings mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah all right thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 operator this
