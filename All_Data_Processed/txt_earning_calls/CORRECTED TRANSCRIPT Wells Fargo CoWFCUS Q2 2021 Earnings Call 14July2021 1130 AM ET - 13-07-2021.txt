brief comments about our second quarter results the operating environment and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review second quarter results in more detail let me start with the second quarter we earned billion or per common share in the second quarter these results included billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to outperform our expectations chargeoffs continued to decline as the economy continues to improve and our customers continue to have high levels of liquidity revenue increased compared with the first quarter while net interest income was stable we had sizable gains from equity securities and card and depositrelated fees increased reflecting increased spending expenses declined reflecting a decline in personnel expense which is typically highest in the first quarter and progress on our efficiency initiatives if you look through the reserve release and outsized gains from equity securities we are pleased that our results continued to show progress even though high levels of liquidity weakness in supply chains and low interest rates remained as headwinds economic growth was robust in the second quarter with real gdp estimated to have increased at an annual rate with especially strong gains in consumer spending we continued to see supply chain shortages impacting both supply and prices across many sectors home prices are estimated to have increased at a annual rate as scarcity of properties for sale persisted and half of unit sales exceeded asking price used car prices continue to increase due to ongoing supply constraints with the second quarter manheim index increasing from first quarter and from a year ago however prices may have peaked in may after four consecutive months of record highs with junes manheim index finishing lower than may for wells fargo consumer customers nearly billion of federal stimulus payments from rounds two and three have been deposited into our customers accounts and we estimate roughly remained in their accounts as of july for our customers who received stimulus payments their median deposit balance was up compared to april which is prior to the first round of federal stimulus payments and for all of our customers including customers who did not receive stimulus payments median balances were up over that same time period weekly debit card spend was up every week compared to during the second quarter and the areas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered including travel up entertainment up and restaurant spending up during the week ending june compared with consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase up in the second quarter compared to as of the week ended june travelrelated spending which was hardest hit during the pandemic was up significantly from but was the only category that has not fully rebounded to levels wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 our commercial banking clients have also continued to have high levels of cash onhand and accommodative capital markets and supply chain disruptions continued to a continued decline in commercial banking loans outstanding albeit at a slower pace than the last few quarters now that were halfway through the year let me update you on progress weve made in the areas i highlighted at the beginning of the year ive spoken at every call about our most important initiative making progress on risk and control wells fargos top priority continues to be building the right foundation for a company of our size and complexity when done this should meet our regulatory requirements and we remain committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls maintain the highest levels of integrity and have appropriate control and appropriate culture in place the amount of customer remediation and controlrelated issues that existed when i arrived was many multiples of what should exist at our company ive spoken of what weve put in place to address these issues and by most metrics we are making significant progress regarding our work on consent orders and other regulatory requirements the work remaining is significant and as such this remains a multiyear journey for us while whats required for each is clear there are numerous complexities with managing this amount of work concurrently and it will take time to consistently accomplish all at the level we and our regulators expect as such we may have setbacks and progress will not be a straight line however i remain confident in our ability to complete the work building a strong management team was another key priority when i first joined wells our objective was to ensure we have the talent necessary to close our risk and control gaps during the firsthalf of my tenure around of seniorlevel hires were in these functions and many more across the company directed their efforts towards these activities this remains our most important priority today we will continue to add resources here but were also adding significant resources to improve our competitiveness and provide the foundation for higher levels of performance during the secondhalf of my tenure while we continue to hire senior leaders in risk and control areas weve been increasing our hiring in areas that will grow our business with over of our seniorlevel hires focused on this objective this includes significant hires in data platform and analytics strategy digital and our technology groups were focused on the cloud payments fintech competition tech companies and our own data and digital capabilities hires include a digital platform leader for all of our consumer businesses a head of digital for commercial banking and the cib head of strategy and innovation for consumer and small business banking head of our commercial auto group head of consumer banking national business development and a new head of payment strategies for the entire company were also adding bankers in the cib and commercial bank where we see growth opportunities we also just announced last week that weve hired bei ling as the new head of human resources she will be joining us in october and providing clear business focus and strategic direction has been important as well as we allocate our resources we will not do anything to jeopardize our controlrelated work but we have also begun to execute on plans to build whats necessary to compete effectively in todays dynamic business environment our playbook was dated and it was time to provide direction and be more aggressive about building leading products capabilities and innovating weve been focused on targeting our resources to whats most meaningful today for our customers by selling or closing businesses and were leveraging our breadth and scale to compete with banks and nonbanks alike by working to build new capabilities and work across the company to deliver all of wells fargo to our customer base wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 were rebuilding core capabilities but are beginning to instill a mobilefirst mindset as part of our broader technology and dataguided effort one example is our credit card business where weve been working on it since i arrived to build the foundation to compete more effectively being competitive here is both an opportunity to grow but more importantly its a strategic imperative as credit and payments are critical to maintain and build customer relationships we will do this with both traditional card products and other ways over time our playbook is simple build an experienced management team update and relaunch products customers will make topofwallet improve customer service and leverage both our branches and strong digital capabilities to serve our customers in the second quarter we announced the first new product of several to come an industryleading cash back card which is now just rolling out were also enhancing our deposit products our no overdraft product clear access banking continued to perform well with over accounts opened since the launch in the third quarter of last year we also simplified and improved the benefits of our portfolio by wells fargo checking customers in the second quarter this year these are just a few examples of how were moving forward but we have initiatives across all businesses which well cover over time and lastly we continued to take meaningful actions and are progressing towards better returns as we highlighted at the beginning of the year we see a path to get to doubledigit rotce excluding credit loss reserve releases and then moving towards approximately we said that the path to doubledigit rotce is dependent on capital optimization and executing on our efficiency initiatives with ccar complete and a return to the scb framework were now in a position to return significant capital to shareholders we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend to per share subject to final board approval increasing our dividend is a priority and our plan contemplates continued increases as we grow earnings capacity additionally our capital plan included approximately billion of gross common share repurchases starting in the third quarter and concluding in the second quarter next year this may change depending on a variety of factors including our earnings and economic outlook mike will provide more context here importantly we remain on target to accomplish the expense reductions contemplating in achieving the doubledigit rotce level assuming no material changes in the economic environment or interest rates we expect to achieve a sustainable rotce excluding reserve releases and other special items both positive and negative on a run rate basis during beyond this we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted a modest increase in interest rates or a further steepening of the curve ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives a small impact from returns on growthrelated investments in our businesses and continued execution on our risk regulatory and control framework the combination of these factors we believe would take our rotce to approximately over time and while were focused on improving our execution results we know that supporting our customers and communities will continue to be an important part of our mission the work we did through the pandemic was meaningful and necessary to help those most in need especially consumers and small businesses but there remains much more to do we offered payment deferrals waived fees supported smaller and diverse small businesses through the paycheck protection program we committed to donate all gross processing fees from ppp loans funded in totaling approximately million to help small businesses recovery efforts and have completed funding of million of our commitment we expect to fund the rest by the end of the year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 we are also voluntarily extending our foreclosure moratorium on mortgage loans we own through the end of this year and were pleased that the industry is contemplating similar foreclosure extensions we issued our first sustainability bond which will fund projects and programs that support housing affordability socioeconomic opportunity and renewable energy we partnered with diverse firms in the offering of our billion sustainability bond with approximately of the economics going to these firms underscoring our commitment to supporting historically marginalized communities we fulfilled the pledge that we made last year to commit million to blackowned banks and communities across the country with investments in two additional africanamerican minority deposit institutions during the second quarter and we announced the banking inclusion initiative a 10year commitment to help unbanked individuals gain access to affordable transactional accounts this is a complex and longstanding issue that will require gathering the best minds ideas products and educational resources from across our communities to bring about change and help remove barriers to financial inclusion in summary let me say that the outlook for the economy for the rest of the year is promising assuming continued success against covid the restocking of inventories is expected to be substantial and the excess personnel savings should provide a cushion for consumer spending however risks remain interest rates have been volatile and the recent rally in rates is putting pressure on net interest income weve made meaningful progress in our important priorities during the firsthalf of the year but this is just the start of a multiyear process to transform wells fargo i want to thank everyone at wells for their hard work and focus on supporting our customers ill now turn the call over to mike michael santomassimo chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co thanks charlie and good morning everyone charlie highlighted many of the ways were actively helping our customers and communities on slide so im going to start with our second quarter financial results on slide net income for the quarter was billion or per common share as charlie highlighted our second quarter results included a billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses pretax preprovision profit grew from both the yearago and from the first quarter as we grew revenue and reduced expenses we had billion or approximately billion after noncontrolling interests of pretax equity gains predominantly coming from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses approximately billion was due to unrealized gains from followon financing rounds reflecting significantly higher valuations in a number of portfolio companies the remaining approximately million was realized gains given the nature of these businesses these gains tend to be episodic however since these businesses have generated annual gains in excess of billion in every year except which was impacted by the pandemic we completed the sale of student loans in the second quarter which resulted in a sic million gain and a million writedown of related goodwill our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was which reflected accounting policy changes for certain taxadvantaged investments we elected to make these changes to better align the financial statement presentation of the economic impact of these investments with the related tax credits prior period financial statement line items have been revised which had a nominal impact in net income on an annual basis the changes did improve our efficiency ratio and increased our effective income tax rate from what was previously reported we provide details regarding these changes on slide in the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 appendix of this deck and on page of the quarterly supplement reflecting these changes we expect our effective income tax rate for the fullyear to be approximately our cet1 ratio increased to in the second quarter this years ccar stress test confirmed the significant strength of our capital position based on the results we expect our stress capital buffer to increase basis points effective in the fourth quarter of this year and as a reminder our gsib capital surcharge will decrease by basis points effective in the first quarter of next year which will bring our cet1 regulatory minimum to in the first quarter of as charlie highlighted we plan to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders starting in the third quarter and expect to move closer to our internal target of basis points above the regulatory minimum over time we also currently expect to maintain an incremental buffer of to basis points above our target to account for potential uncertainties and maintain flexibility under the scb framework we will have flexibility to increase capital distributions and its possible we will be able to repurchase more than the billion included in our capital plan over the fourquarter period depending on market conditions and other risk factors including covidrelated risks turning to credit quality on slide our net chargeoff ratio in the second quarter declined to basis points the improving economic environment with the reopening of the economy government stimulus and ample liquidity as well as customer accommodations have resulted in our credit losses continuing to trend significantly better than our expectations commercial credit performance continued to improve and loan chargeoffs declined million from the first quarter to basis points our lowest loss rate since second quarter of the improvement was broadbased with declines in all commercial asset types including net recoveries in commercial real estate while the overall outlook for commercial real estate continued to improve we remain focused on the areas most impacted by the pandemic the reopening of the economy has continued to have a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flows improved while losses and problem loans in office have been very low we continue to monitor this sector as longerterm demand trends maybe influenced by changes in hybrid workfromhome models its also important to note that even with the reserve release in the second quarter our coverage ratio for commercial real estate loans was still higher than it was a year ago consumer net loan chargeoffs declined from both the first quarter and a yearago to basis points in the second quarter nonperforming assets declined million or from the first quarter driven by lower commercial nonaccruals declines in ci nonaccruals were driven by improvements across a number of covid impacted sectors including entertainment and recreation energy transportation services and retail declines in commercial real estate were driven by improvements in office a yearago billion of our consumer loan portfolio excluding governmentinsured or guaranteed loans was in covidrelated payment deferral deferrals have declined from a year ago to billion at the end of the second quarter we stopped offering nonreal estaterelated covid deferrals in the fourth quarter of but continued to offer certain covidrelated deferrals in home lending for a maximum of months its important to note that loans that have already exited covidrelated deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated with approximately of the balances current as of the end of the second quarter we started to tighten our credit policies in march in response to the pandemic and we have now essentially returned back to precovid levels of policies however we continue to be thoughtful of the much higher asset prices in areas like residential real estate and auto wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 due to reserve release in the quarter our allowance coverage ratio declined from both the first quarter and a year ago similar to the first quarter while reserve credit performance was strong there was still significant uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the second quarter and well continue to assess the level of our coverage if current economic trends continue we would expect to have additional reserve releases on slide we highlight loans and deposits although average loans declined in the quarter the rate of decline slowed with balances down million or from the first quarter the decline from the first quarter was almost entirely driven by lower residential real estate loans primarily due to continued high prepayments and the resecuritization of loans we purchased out of mortgagebacked securities last year the total periodend loans were down from the first quarter and while its hard to predict exactly what will happen during the secondhalf of the year and while line utilization rates remain low we are seeing signs of green shoots with modest growth in periodend balances compared to the first quarter in auto other consumer credit card and commercial real estate average deposits increased billion or from a year ago and from the first quarter with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap now turning to net interest income on slide net interest income was stable from the first quarter as favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results higher income due to additional forgiveness of paycheck protection program or ppp loans and one additional day in the quarter was offset by lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates as we think about net interest income for the remainder of the year the rate of volatility observed over the last few weeks have shown how difficult it can be to forecast even for the next couple of quarters the key drivers continued to be demand for loans and balance sheet yields which are impacted by the level of rates the shape of the curve and credit spreads while the recent rallying rates and continued softness in loan demand have put downward pressure on net interest income we still expect the nii for the fullyear to remain in the range of flat to down from the originally reported and annualized fourth quarter level of billion where in the range we end up will be dependent on the factors i mentioned if rates follow the current forward curve and overall loan balances remain flat from the periodtoend balance at the end of the second quarter for the remainder of the year which would require modest growth in commercial loans we would expect net interest income to be in the lower end of the range if we see rates back up from here and start to see more loan growth well move up in the range we continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each of the major drivers of net interest income and well provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago primarily driven by lower operating losses and also reflected the progress we made on our efficiency initiatives let me highlight a few examples our customers are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities with mobile active customers up from a year ago and the number of checks deposited using mobile growing from a year ago these changes and others have enabled us to adjust rent staffing and you can see this coming through with lower head count and expenses in the consumer banking and lending segment importantly todate weve been able to make these adjustments while improving client satisfaction we reduced the number of our locations including branches and offices by since the start of the year a reduction of over million square feet we also recently agreed to sell our tower in downtown phoenix which includes over square feet we continue to evaluate own locations and locations with upcoming lease expirations for closure and consolidation opportunities we reduced professional and outside services expense by during the firsthalf of this year compared to a year ago this reduction was driven by lower spend on consultants and contractors on various projects across the company in commercial banking weve made progress on changing how we serve our customers optimizing wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 our operations and other backoffice teams and reducing the number of commercial banking lending platforms these efforts were reflected in lower head count expenses in the segment we are on track in executing our efficiency plans included in our expense outlook of approximately billion our outlook excluded restructuring charges and the cost of business segments which totaled million during the firsthalf of this year and included billion of operating losses which totaled just over million during the firsthalf of the year keep in mind operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable and especially as we continue to address the significant work left to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements we also assumed approximately million of incremental revenuerelated expenses and these have been higherthanexpected so far this year due to strong equity markets which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offset any increase in expenses if current market levels hold we would expect incremental revenuerelated compensation to be approximately billion which could put us over billion well continue to update you as the year progresses turning to our business segment starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago primarily due to higher debit card transaction volume and higher depositrelated fees which were lower in due to fee waivers provided at the onset of the pandemic home lending revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher servicing income as last year we had a significant negative valuation adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights asset we also had higher origination and sales revenue in the second quarter due to higher gains from the resecuritization of loans we purchased from mortgagebacked securities last year and an increase in retail originations the decline in revenue from the first quarter was primarily due to lower retail heldforsale originations and gainonsale margins gainonsale margins are expected to continue to decline in the secondhalf of the year credit card revenue increased from a year ago driven by increased spending additionally in response to the pandemic second quarter included higher customer accommodations and fee waivers auto revenue increased from a year ago on higher loan balances now turning to some key business drivers in slide while we believe mortgage originations in the industry declined from the first quarter our mortgage originations increased a declining correspondent originations was more than offset by growth in retail with an increase in retail heldforinvestment volume partially offset by lower heldforsale volume our second quarter retail mortgage origination volume increased from the first quarter and was the highest since we currently expect third quarter originations to decline modestly although refinancing volumes can be stronger than currently forecasted with the recent rate rally if lower rates persist we also expect our retail originations to decline less than the industry as weve improved capability to serve our customers mortgage financing needs consumer demand for auto loans continued to be very strong despite higher prices and limited inventory auto originations increased from the first quarter and from a year ago with june setting new monthly record for originations exceeding our previous highs since june of turning to debit card purchase volume increased from the first quarter and from a year ago reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments improving economic conditions credit card pointofsale purchase volume was up from the first quarter as the economy continued to open and in may we had our highest monthly spending volume in recent history the increased activity has not yet translated into significantly higher balances as payment rates remained high on slide the commercial banking results are highlighted and excludes the corporate trust business which is now reported in corporate and prior periods have been revised middle market banking revenue declined wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 from a year ago primarily due to the impact of lower loan balances and lower interest rates which were partially offset by higher deposit balances and depositrelated fees assetbased lending and leasing revenue declined from a year ago driven by the impact of lower loan balances which was partially offset by improved loan spreads higher net gains on equity securities in our strategic capital business and higher revenue from our renewable energy investments noninterest expense declined from a year ago primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense average loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter and were down from a year ago the demand for loans declined due to low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions while there are some green shoots in select industries demand has not yet picked up average balances were up from a year ago reflecting significant liquidity from stimulus programs turning to corporate and investment banking on slide in banking total revenue declined from a year ago the decrease was driven by lower debt capital markets revenue the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances predominantly due to actions taken and managed under the asset cap commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by higher cmbs gainonsale margins and volumes commercial real estate capital markets transaction volumes increased significantly from a year ago driven by low rates tighter spreads excess liquidity in the market and stable improving real estate fundamentals while acquisition activity picked up in the second quarter loan demand was predominantly driven by refinance activity markets revenue declined from a year ago from lower trading activity across most asset classes compared to the higher trading activity we experienced in the second quarter of as the markets recovered due to the monetary and fiscal stimulus in response to the pandemic our markets revenue has been negatively impacted by actions we have taken to manage under the asset cap as well noninterest expense declined from a year ago primarily driven by lower operating losses average deposits declined from a year ago primarily driven by continued actions we have taken to manage under the asset cap on slide we have wealth and investment management which grew revenue by in the second quarter compared with a year ago noninterest income was up from a year ago primarily driven by higher asset based fees on higher market valuations which was partially offset by lower net interest income driven by lower interest rates revenuerelated compensation drove the increase in noninterest expense compared with a year ago we ended the second quarter with record client assets of trillion up from a year ago reflecting strong market performance average deposits were up from a year ago and average loans increased from a year ago due to customer demand for securitiesbased lending offerings slide highlights our corporate results revenue growth from a year ago and from the first quarter was driven by the equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equities businesses that i highlighted earlier in the call second quarter results also benefited from the gain on the sale of student loans and a modest gain on the sale of our canadian equipment finance business we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you hear me okay charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks hey so i did just want to understand a little bit about the commentary that you were making earlier around a rotce that youre expecting you will be able to do that in without reserve release which is seemingly a pretty bold statement given what consensus is looking for if i ex out the reserve release it feels like theres a percentage point or so differential there can you help us understand what the drivers are going to be to do that and if its in the expenses can you give us some sense as to which parts of your business is going to be feeding that most thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so let me start out and then mike can chime in i guess the way we thought about it is to just lets first start and think about the earnings of this quarter and do our best to look through all of those things which we know arent really recurring and so if you think about the sale of the student loan business the change in allowance and even obviously weve got those outsized gains in nep nvp but at the same time we dont assume they go to zero over the course of the following year and then you could even normalize for chargeoffs getting them to somewhat of a higher level but if you do that what weve said is that with our expense reductions that weve contemplated with the ability to return capital you can get to that level and so we obviously have the ability now to return a significant amount of excess capital that we have thats an extremely meaningful driver of the improvement in rotce and its a think about it as like a somewhat modest improvement in the rest of the performance to get there in terms of the company from where we sit today wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 so we dont want to talk in any level of specificity at this point about the specifics about expenses but were working extremely hard not just to get the efficiencies that were important to meet our expectations for this year but to position us properly next year to reduce expenses on a net basis while we have the ability to invest significantly inside the company michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and i would just point out betsy its not a fullyear what he said was its the run rate in at some point right so charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so it could be your exit run rate charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co it could be betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just separately could you speak to the flexibility on the buybacks i know you indicated the billion or billion under the scb framework should we be taking that as a minimum buyback level because i think that reflects your ask in the or at least what you not an ask but what you put into the test and youve got earnings that youre generating and the environment is improving so could you imagine that buybacks could be higher than that over the course of the next four quarters charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think i mean i think the signal is that it could be higher or lower depending on exactly how our results turn out and what we think the outlook to the economy is and potentially where the stock price is even though thats really not a factor in our thinking today given our view of the valuation we obviously would hope that it would be more not less and we have the flexibility under the scb framework to do that so i think you all can do your calculations on what you think well earn next year weve given you the guidelines for how were thinking about where were targeting our capital ratios to be and wed like to we dont see any need to have excess capital sitting around the company at this point especially given the fact that we have the asset cap betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay charlie and mike thanks so much appreciate it wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question will come from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good afternoon charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question just on the head count trajectory you started to make some real progress driving some of the head count reductions that youve spoken to its down about yearonyear but if i will comp you against the peer group bofa probably being the closest comp you still have more employees despite a similar business mix and scale i recognize that certainly some of thats going to be tied to the consent order but i was hoping charlie you can maybe just give us some context or perspective on as you start to execute on the plan of optimizing that head count whats the right level to support your strategic vision for the franchise charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i think its a great question i think your numbers are accurate for sure just a couple of things i would say i think first of all you can imagine we try and do all those numbers ourselves and between other places that weve all worked at the senior management team it is very hard to get applestoapples because different people in source different functions and so but directionally your point is still right so im not sure the magnitude is exactly right versus just bank of america but directionally i think it is a fair statement and i think that is what the that is a simple driver that gets everyones attention here as well as were frankly just as we look around the company and we see our processes and we see the things that we havent done nearly as well and so thats why when we think about the future that we have we still continue to believe that there are significant efficiencies on a gross basis that well be able to continue to drive out the company over time we would love to do as much of it through natural attrition as possible given the size of the company we have significant attrition and people selfselect because of how were going about doing things but i think and we think about where were going and our ability to reinvest in the company we think that theres a lot there and i think again as we get towards the end of the year well talk about next year with some more specificity and at some point give you a little more clarity i think were still in the stage of peeling the onion back and every time you peel a layer of the onion back you see the next layer even more clearly and i think were still in that stage but it does give us a pretty good feeling about our ability to continue to drive this forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 thanks for that perspective charlie and just for my followup on the nii outlook mike i was hoping you could just unpack the nii guidance a bit further specifically what does it contemplate in terms of premium am and excess liquidity deployment and is there any noise relating to some of the loan sales that could drive some volatility in the backhalf as we think about the trajectory michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah theres no noise from loan sale per se but let me break out aspects of it and kind of talk through what was included there so obviously the curve is going to be an important element of it and what we said in the remarks right is that at this point were assuming its about where it is right its been bouncing around the last few days but sort of think about it as about where it is right now and then as you sort of look forward on loans and you assume that overall loans stay sort of flattish to where we exited the quarter that does require a little bit of growth modest growth on the commercial side and so thats sort of embedded in the assumption i think on premium amort you saw it come down a bit in the quarter versus the first quarter were still expecting that to come down i think it could bounce around slightly versus what the assumptions are given where rates are but we think the direction is still the right direction and then you may have a little bit of noise between q3 and q4 given some of the ppprelated forgiveness that may happen but thats sort of what were assuming overall to get to and that gets you towards the bottom of the range that weve given hopefully were surprised by loan growth or back up in rates again but thats what were assuming at this point steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color thanks for taking my questions operator your next question will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey mike on the mortgage business i wanted to ask you yeah you said that you had the loans that were in the loan book that you moved into and resecuritized so can you help us understand how much of a benefit that might have been in mortgage banking this quarter and just your general outlook for origination trends and whats happening in the gainonsale market thank you michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah good questions ken so ill try and unpick it if i miss something let me know but as you sort of think about gainonsale the gainonsale continues to come down each quarter and we would expect that to continue and at this point what thats driven by is just the capacity thats been built up in the industry and as people get a little more competitive on price thats going to drive gainonsale down now i think what youve also seen us do there is really focus on the retail channel and to some degree deemphasize the corresponding channel or use it to kind of fill in the capacity that weve got and so that should be helpful as we sort of think about gainonsale but the direction is certainly going down and i think as ive said at this point i think its really capacitydriven more than anything else from here forward wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 as you look at the and i also said in the remarks that we think origination volumes are going to be down a bit in q3 versus q2 yeah theres lots of different prognostications on the market we think based on what were seeing we think well be down less than the market but nonetheless well be a little bit down now if we could see a little bit of a gap of refi activity that could change that a little bit but right now we think its probably down just a little as you look at the impact of the epbo gains it was about million on a link increased on a linkedquarter basis we do expect to continue to have some gains in the third and fourth quarter it probably comes down a bit from where it was in the second quarter as we sort of look quarterbyquarter but maybe a little bit less than whether its increased versus the first quarter but we do expect those to continue and youll see weve still got about a little under billion of those loans on the balance sheet and youll see the exact number when we put out the q kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right great thanks and just one followup on the consumerrelated fees good to see that depositrelated side in card rebounding can you just talk about the type of momentum that youre seeing there and just should we expect ongoing improvements from here in those areas thanks michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look its just activity levels picking up and you can see that in the card volume metrics that weve put out there and so i think assuming we continue to see the recovery take hold and activity levels pick up then there should be those are highly correlated there so charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and i would and this is charlie i would just add i would say different slightly different dynamics on debit and credit right debit if you look at the remarks that i made the consumers still have a substantial amount of cash youve seen it in overall deposit levels and the willingness to spend as things open up is certainly what youre seeing and so that should continue to drive debit spend upward and then credit is having similar benefits from reopening that the whole industry is seeing kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning i want to see if you can give a little bit more color just around the loan growth outlook maybe if you can talk about commercial versus consumer on the commercial side are you starting to see utilization trends turn and is capex beginning to contribute to some increased willingness to drawdown wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 and then on the consumer side just curious what youre seeing in terms of payment rates specifically in the card businesses are we starting to see the payment rates inflect and do you think thats sustainable thanks michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah hey john its mike ill take that and charlie can jump in if he wants ill try to pick it apart piecebypiece in the commercial bank loans are still down and utilization rates are pretty low on a historic basis and i think overall that has not inflected yet and theres lots of reasons high liquidity supply chain issues demand for product in certain industries lots of things that sort of underpin that but we havent really seen that inflect yet theres a little bit of maybe differences by size of clients or by sector but overall its still not quite there yet again theres lots of good conversations so i think people are really thinking about investments and really are thinking about building inventory levels over the coming quarters but i think that will take some time before it starts to translate into loan growth in the commercial bank in the corporate and investment bank we do see the loans there are up a little bit so youre seeing some activity in subscription finance real estate in a few places but again relatively small so far but you are seeing a little bit of activity there and well see how that progresses on the consumer side and i know a lot of others are talking about this too if you look at through the endofperiod balances youre seeing a little bit of growth in auto we had a really good quarter from an origination point of view in the auto business but its a relatively small portfolio in the scheme of the balance sheet youre seeing a little bit of growth in card although the activity has really picked up there it hasnt quite translated into bigger volumes given the payment rates as you sort of pointed out theres still payment rates are still really high and i think theyll come down and normalize eventually but theyre still pretty high so i think well see how that progresses and then we still expect a further decline albeit at a much slower pace in the home lending space as we work out of the ebp the early buyout loans and see prepayment activity start to stabilize in that business so well see how it all comes together over the next quarter or two john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay mike thanks thats helpful and then separately on the consumer front can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the rationale for exiting the personal credit lines as a product and if theres any other areas like that within your lending product suite that you might be considering similarly to exit thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure this is charlie that was a product of a pretty exhaustive effort that we went through across the whole company to look at what we thought was core where we had some kind of strategic advantage or where it really was important for the customer relationships as we look forward and so out of that exercise came our decisions to sell the corporate trust to exit the international wealth business sell the asset management businesses and a couple of other things that we have announced the things that we have announced are the things that were actively working on and so theres really theres nothing more in progress now wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 the way we looked at the business was quite simple it was very very small business for us we have products in our card products as well as we were still in the personal loan business and so we have the ability to continue to serve customers who either want access to credit or actual being able to draw down and fund it over term and so again the idea of just simplifying the company around focusing on products that are most important to the broadest set of customers thats what led us to the decision john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thank you for taking my questions charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co of course operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning gentlemen mike can you share with us i think i dont think you have addressed this but your loanloss reserves remain very strong you guys have very strong credit as evidenced by this quarter in the history of this company and your reserves are about basis points i think above where they were at day one in january of when you guys did the cecl trueup can you share with us the outlook for reserves could they get back down to that level and if the outlook is even better than it was in january of could the reserves actually fall below the cecl levels michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look gerard i think thats a first on the reserves we need to be reserved for a whole bunch of different scenarios on any given time and so as we sort of look at the path that were on theres a lot to be optimistic about but there are still some risks there that we need to be mindful of from where we are today but if things keep progressing we should have future releases as we have noted if you think about where you end up i think thats a hard thing to call right now in terms of any degree of certainty at a point in time because it will be a function of as you mentioned the outlook that you have at that point the mix of your balance sheet and other factors that go into sort of your view on the future and what could happen but could we end up a little bit higher maybe could we end up a little bit lower maybe i think its theyre all possible scenarios depending on what point in time youre talking about and as you know theres a lot of things like elements of the office market in commercial real estate that will take a while to really play out and so well see how that progresses over time but i think it will be a function of all those things of exactly where we end up gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and i know this question is putting the cart before the horse and im not asking you guys to predict when the asset cap will be lifted but when the asset cap is lifted how do you think youll proceed going forward wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 theres been some talk in the markets that some of your peer banks are being stretched with their supplementary leverage ratio in fact jpmorgan now has told us that this is their binding constraint and you have to wonder if the wholesale deposit market is going to be disrupted because of this freeing up wells fargo without the asset cap may give you guys the opportunity to pick up some wholesale deposits so again im not asking when the asset cap is going to be lifted but how does it look after it is lifted what are you guys thinking charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well again i think its very hard to answer the question because of as you know we dont know the timing of the asset cap just as if we dont know the timing of any changes which could potentially happen on slr or the way other banks will deal with that so there are a whole series of unknowns that go into the question that im not sure that were in a position to answer just quite frankly michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah and i would just add two things if you think about the actions and weve been very public about this a lot of the actions weve taken as a result of the asset cap is to work with clients to manage deposits to other vehicles or other institutions in some cases and we continue to do that so theres likely to be opportunity there with clients and weve managed areas like our markets business down and think a lot of that could be is financing type trades and some of that we think therell be demand at the right time so i think as you sort of look at that there should be plenty of opportunity for us as we look forward but as charlie said exactly what shape that will take is a little bit of a function of when it happens gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate the color operator your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys some of this has been kind of weaved throughout the call but i was hoping you could just put it together if we look at the next two or three years and obviously assuming youre well past the asset cap what are some of the key organic revenue growth drivers for wells fargo and how meaningful can they be you mentioned credit card you just mentioned some of the markets and wholesale business the wild card but maybe kind of list like three or four of them if there are and what might move the needle as we think about the next few years because youre probably one of the few stories where yes youve got leverage from rising rates but theres also organic cost opportunity like you talked about and probably from organic revenue opportunity so hoping to just kind of package that together for us thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah no i appreciate the question and again so ill just put aside the interest rate environment for a second and i think listen the reality is for a im not sure what the right period of time is but ill just say for a period of time we have been laggards across most of our businesses at growing revenues for many many years we had very very strong financial performance its been a while since thats been the case and when you look at the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 underlying trends of the businesses while i personally think weve done remarkably well in terms of our share stats across the franchise given all that this company has been through which says an awful lot about the people on the frontlines that do it dayin and dayout theres just been very little that weve really done to focus on growing the franchise and i do want to be fair to everyone here right which is that given all the issues that weve had whether its sales practices in the consumer bank as an example mary macks job when she was put into that role was to fix that problem not to focus on growing the business and we continue to have other issues around the company so as weve talked about where our priorities are as ive said in my remarks we understand that continuing to build the risk and control infrastructure and satisfy the regulatory requirement is a gate to a really successful future of ours that we need to get through but at the same time just answering your question i really do believe the opportunities exist in every one of our core businesses and when we go through and we think about the consumer segment again weve been getting our a reasonable share of deposit flow not because were pricing for it not because weve done anything really interesting in our coverage model our products our digital or anything like that its because of who we are and the relationships that we have we need to alter the course by changing all the things that i just mentioned and those are the things that were actively working in the background whether its all of our digital capabilities with this mobilefirst attitude looking at all of our products and services thinking about how we serve the different segments using the data and information that we have to become more targeted in our offerings that should drive a different level of growth in the consumer business weve talked about the card businesses as one of the pieces of our consumer lending business you go on to the you pick the business in our middle market business we dont see much revenue growth both because of rates and because of balances there and we do believe were the best midcommercial lender in the country and the best at being in a position to serve those customers far more broadly and so whether its through improving our treasury management products or the work that weve talked about about utilizing our cib platform to sell investment bank products to these customers who we bank for decades is just a very meaningful opportunity for us in fact the cib were not going to be all things to all people when you look at our fees relative to the lending commitments that we have out there just as a measure of opportunity were not even close to where a company with our risk our existing risk profile should be and by the way its been the team has been improving it but were not shy to say we want to improve it even more from here focused by industry focused by product utilizing the competitive advantages that we have so i really believe and i dont leave anyone out win the exact same thing weve got online capabilities in wellstrade that weve completely underutilized we have a platform for brokers that want to go independent that weve completely underutilized and theyre too all the things that barry sommers is doing to bring our platforms together to be able to offer all of the best products across all the platforms do a better job with things like securitybased loans and mortgages where our stats clearly lag the competition those are just some sound bites but we really believe its everywhere and so that work is going on in the background and hopefully what youll start to see like youve seen with credit card is youll start to see things come to market but again nothings going to jeopardize the risk work we have to do wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so obviously it sounds very broadbased in terms of the opportunities but any way to size it either if you didnt have the asset cap your balance sheet would be say billion bigger now or if loan growth for the industry is over the next several years per year you can do better than that like just any sound bites on sizing charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i would just matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc of where you could be now if you didnt have it or where you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co michael i matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc indiscernible longerterm charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co matt like honestly like were not even thinking about what life is like without the asset cap we quantify for ourselves and what the impact is on having it in this environment because thats the reality of it but there are plenty of opportunities i mean if you go through all the things that i spoke about before very few of those require a balance sheet now it doesnt mean that theres not opportunity cost for having it but thats not an excuse for us not to do some other things and when we get to the future well talk about it when we get there matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and matt i have quantified some of the actions weve taken in the past in other forums and so id go back to some of that but its significant and its hundreds of billions of dollars of actions weve taken to help manage through the asset cap so that should give you a pretty good sense of what the impacts been matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 operator your next question will come from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions charlie and mike a quick clarification to your answer to just the last question since charlie you said you arent contemplating life without the asset cap does that mean that the billion buyback that you talked more in the ccar that does not that assumes the current situation it does not assume the lift of the asset cap charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah vivek what i think he meant was were not playing a bunch of whatifs like where we would have been right now if like the asset cap wasnt in place right so i think thats i would take that in that context and i think as we sort of look for our capital planning were assuming that its in place during the period vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay second quick one for you mike hedging effectiveness gain you meant how much was it and could it continue michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah the hedging effectiveness absolute impact in the quarter is very small you do have a bit of a linked quarter variance because we had a negative hedging ineffectiveness result in the first quarter given what happened with rates during the first quarter but the absolute impact thats embedded in the second quarter is actually really small vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so then something else drove down that kind of longterm debt cost by basis points michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah yeah i think if you look at longterm debt right part of it is we reduced our longterm if you look at the absolute longterm debt cost we reduced the rate and we reduced the amount and the rates down vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks mike operator your next question will come from the line of david long with raymond james david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 hi everyone as it relates to the buybacks it seems like you guys are pretty optimistic on your capital levels in the economic backdrop can you accelerate the pace of buybacks here in the nearterm by that i mean is it possible that you could buyback a higher fraction in the third quarter meaning billion or billion worth of your stock michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah look were always looking at like the pace and were not going to get into specifics of what were going to do before but charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and when you say fast like we havent said how much we intend to do by quarter yeah david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc sure michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co and so obviously were going to be mindful of how with the pacing that we do it and were going to be prudent about that and we start with a lot of extra capital so we feel really confident that well be able to get that moving at the right pace soon david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for that color and then my second question relates to the ppp forgiveness and its not going to be huge to the bottom line for you guys but could you disclose what the impact was on forgiveness fees in the quarter specific to the second quarter michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co we did not but you did see we did see our ppp balances come down from roughly about billion to about billion so and well see those continue to come down and well continue to have some impacts from as the remaining loans start to get forgiven over the next few quarters charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and also keep in mind that we have said that we are giving away the fees and so very little if any net bottom line impact from that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah so were giving away the fees for the gross fees for the loans that originated in so i think and thats mostly whats being forgiven now wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc right got it appreciate it thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi just had a very quick follow up and i know this is a few years out charlie but i think you mentioned over time you think the bank can achieve a rotce how much of that is dependent on interest rates moving higher and does that eventually mean the asset cap can move higher for wells to get to that kind of ph rotce charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah yes it certainly does assume that the asset cap is gone and it assumes higher rates and we havent really been specific about exactly what that means and what weve said is listen we first want to get to doubledigits this is a were on a journey and thats kind of where were thats where were headed and once we get to then we can talk with some more clarity about whats next ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just in terms of clarifying your guidance on expenses as we think about beyond is it safe to assume that incremental expense growth would be driven by revenue generation as opposed to further investments so there maybe some room in terms of cost expense savings beyond this year charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah we havent talked about our outlook on expenses past this year i think what weve said which i think is continuing to be true is that weve got a were in the middle of a multiyear efficiency program and even with some of the investments that we need to make that we should be able to bring expenses down on a net basis for the next couple years but so i think that still stands ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you operator your final question will come from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey mike i wanted to just do another quick followup on the expense comments for this year could you just repeat what you said about the revenuerelated expenses and where theyre trending relative to what you baked in and kind of how that ties to the billion target for this year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah no sure sure john thanks embedded in our original outlook of about billion we assume that revenuerelated would increase about million and at this point we think thats probably more like billion so an incremental million and thats really largely driven by the advisory assets and business that we have in our wealth management group thats doing really well particularly given where the market levels have been and so thats putting pressure on the billion so its possible if that holds that we could be a little over billion and obviously that excludes restructuring and the cost of business exits so thats the way to think about it john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and it also includes the expense benefit of business exits too right so thats not factored into that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co no no the billion yes sorry the billion john assumes that those businesses were here the fullyear except for the student loan business but for corporate trust and asset management it is assumed they were there the fullyear once we get to closing which should happen later this year well update how we think thats going to progress based on how we think the transition service agreements will play out john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then just looking at your yeartodate expense numbers the cadence then implies that youre stepping down in the backhalf of the year to something that kind of averages closer to billion a quarter im just kind of playing out the math is that the right way to think about it michael santomassimo a chief financial officer senior executive vice president wells fargo co yeah i think thats what the math would imply john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks john operator and with that ill turn the conference back over to management charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co great well listen thank you all so much for the time we appreciate it and if we dont talk to you during the quarter well talk to you next quarter take care wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript q2 earnings
