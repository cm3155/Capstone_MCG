emily will cover in a few minutes turning to the full year financial results on slide and im referring to them on an adjusted basis earnings per share of were flat to the prior year on revenues of billion fee revenue increased over excluding notable items and almost million impact of fee waivers in expenses were flat as our cost discipline and productivity gains essentially offset incremental investment and the operating margin was solid at now we have a lower risk feebased business model that positioned us well for this environment we had no net chargeoffs we also delivered strong results from the two rounds of federal reserve stress tests announced in june and december our model is highly capitalgenerative and our common equity tier ratio increased to from now when i shared my priorities with you a year ago of course no one expected that the world would change so rapidly and dramatically throughout the pandemic we have supported employees clients and our communities and were proud to provide the infrastructure for several critical government programs for covid relief including the term assetbacked securities loan facility the municipal liquidity facility the primary dealer credit facility and the payment protection program now while navigating the extraordinary environment we continue to advance our longterm growth in net agenda across all of our businesses that agenda includes accelerating our digital and data transformation investing in several growth opportunities and leveraging the power of the open architecture platforms and solutions we provide to help our clients grow their businesses in asset servicing we have seen no letup in client onboarding this year this is a testament to our focus on client experience data and digitization half of our auca growth in asset servicing yearoveryear was from organic growth with new and existing clients and we built positive momentum we closed out the year with significantly higher win ratios and retention rates and had our best sales quarter in the last in the fourth quarter of once onboarded these wins will start to benefit revenue in late weve been pursuing a strategy of moving up and across client value chains beyond just supporting operations to revolutionize data and digitalenabled solutions across front middle and back offices for example we were recently mandated one of the largest asset managers in europe to provide fronttoback services adding custody accounting and transfer agency this includes a collaboration to integrate an order management system to deliver portfolio and risk management improve sales and distribution and operational efficiencies this is another example of our openarchitected security servicing platform which we call omni we are currently integrated with the leading oms providers that cover of the addressable market and our partnerships are starting to help us win business as the above example illustrates we also have a leading data and analytics business and are now building on our 20year track record in software and service to create robust cloudbased data and analytics capabilities with the help of several new clients who are early adopters we have introduced a new platform called the data vault which allows clients to quickly onboard and manage both structured and unstructured data from many sources the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 to share one example we were selected by janus henderson to transform their global data platform including implementing the data vault which will help improve the quality and ease of access to investment information across the enterprise we also have a suite of new business applications for the front office such as our esg investment analytics application which has recently won a significant award as well as our distribution analytics offering to help clients with asset growth these applications together with the vault position us well to drive growth pershing is one of the unique businesses that differentiates us from our custody peers that helps us build deep relationships and is a powerful source of additional connectivity to the fastgrowing wealth ph space fourth quarter results in pershing benefited from elevated transaction volumes which are expected to moderate a bit in as well as continued strong underlying fundamentals net new assets for the year were billion pershings business which includes over brokerdealers and registered investment adviser firms is a very attractive and efficient platform for our asset servicing clients to access their points of distribution in fact today through pershing asset managers have placed trillion of their product and continue to value this new unique opportunity that only we can offer clearance and collateral management fees were up in excluding the disposal of an equity investment last year and we continue to innovate in this space for example as a result of intense collaboration between our market business asset servicing clearance and collateral management and group treasury we are in the process of launching an innovative solution that offers clients the ability to pledge money market fund shares to meet triparty collateral obligations across a wide range of transaction types such as repo and securities lending agreements secured note programs collateralized deposits and also allows segregation of initial margins for derivative contracts all in straightthrough processing models so clients can now buy money market funds on our liquiditydirect platform and seamlessly pledge them as collateral in these types of transactions in treasury services where we delivered good performance we have continued investing in automation and are advancing our realtime payments capabilities we are actively working on an exciting largescale commercial payments pilot with one of the worlds largest ph billers this capability is expected to reach tens of millions of consumers via their retail banks throughout leveraging continued adoption across the rtp network thats known as the realtime payments system within investment management flows have been largely in step with industry trends and weve offset equity outflows with strong fixed income cash and ldi inflows weve had three straight quarters now of longterm inflows and have improved investment indiscernible performance across the top ranked strategies by revenue are in the top two quartiles on a ph threeyear basis compared to just over a year ago in we launched eight etfs with more to come this year weve also been building out sustainability funds such as the future of humans fund with ubs and a series of mellon funds focused on pressing global themes for example aging populations finally we continue to build out our leadership team john tobin was recently named as the chief investment officer of dreyfus cash investment strategies bringing to this role of deep and broad money market industry expertise we will continue to build on our leadership across the entire cash ecosystem to position our business for longterm growth and just a couple of weeks ago we announced that euan munro would be joining us as ceo of newton in june newton has a proven and highly relevant track record in the investment industry the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 spanning three decades hell be a great addition to newton so were excited to have both of them join hannekes team before i hand over to emily id be remiss if i did not comment on our push at bny mellon towards ever greater diversity and inclusion we have one of the most diverse fortune boards and our executive committee has become increasingly diverse to accelerate progress in our most underrepresented ethnic populations and help position our firm as a competitive choice with black and latinx graduates and experienced professionals we set some concrete shortterm representation goals in the us its important on many levels and we know diversity is highly correlated to longterm financial performance and finally during the year i made a number of appointments to my leadership team we have a highly motivated group of talented employees implementing our strategy which is centered on driving growth creating differentiated value for our clients digitizing and optimizing our operating model and fostering a highperformance culture that is focused on delivering excellent client service in new and innovative ways with that emily will now review our fourth quarter results in more detail after which i will make some concluding remarks emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd and good morning everyone i will walk you through the details of our results for the quarter and briefly review the full year as well all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise beginning on page of the financial highlights document in the fourth quarter of we reported revenue of billion and eps of both the current and prior year quarters included a number of notable items the fourth quarter results included an unfavorable per share impact from charges related to litigation severance expenses losses on two noncore business sales and lease exits and real estate sales for real estate the charge is a result of plans to exit around of our overall footprint and we expect this will be breakeven on an annualized basis within a year remember our results in the fourth quarter of benefited from a gain on the sale of an equity investment partially offset by severance and litigation expenses and net securities losses when excluding these notable items the fourth quarter of revenue was down and eps was down results were negatively impacted by continued low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers net interest revenue was down excluding notable items and fee waivers fees grew driven by the impact of higher market levels and continued positive momentum across most of our businesses fx and other trading was roughly flat due to million of ph seed capital hedge losses in the fourth quarter of or about negative impact to that line item yearoveryear which is offset in investment and other income expenses are down on both a reported and adjusted basis with adjusted results due to savings in te and distribution and servicing expenses offset by continued investment in technology and the unfavorable impact of a weaker us dollar our provision for credit losses was million reflecting reserve additions related to our commercial real estate portfolio pretax margin of or excluding notable items which considering the impact of interest rates and waivers which have minimal expenses associated with them show the resiliency of our model roe was and rotce was and included approximately basis points and basis point impact respectively from the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 notable items we also continued to generate substantial excess capital as our cet1 and tier capital each increased by about million this quarter page sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results and is adjusted for notable items were indicated investment services revenue was billion down the decline was primarily a result of lower net interest revenue and fee waivers these headwinds masked benefits from higher market levels volumes and liquidity balances as well as strong underlying momentum across many of our businesses which ill get into later investment and wealth management revenue increased as higher market values and the impact of the weaker us dollar along with improved investment performance offset the impact from fee waivers the impact of money market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue net of distribution and servicing expense was million in the quarter at the lower end of the million to million we previously guided to and an increase of million quarteronquarter whereas in prior quarters most of this impact was felt largely through pershing or clearing service lines and to a lesser extent investment management this quarter we began to see a more meaningful impact within asset servicing and issuer services we have provided you with a detail of the impact by business in the appendix of this highlights deck turning to page and setting out full year results and trends our full year results demonstrated resiliency and balance sheet strength during an unprecedented time excluding notable items fees grew despite a roughly basis point negative impact from fee waivers full year expenses were essentially flat on an operating basis in line with the guidance we have provided throughout the year operating eps was flat despite the impact from low interest rates and as we absorbed a higher credit provision and we delivered a solid pretax margin and strong rotce for a challenging year turning to page our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimum common equity tier capital totaled billion as of december and our cet1 ratio was under the advanced approach and under the standardized approach tier leverage was down basis points from the third quarter due to higher deposits as weve noted in the past we are comfortable operating with a ratio of around to versus the regulatory minimum our current tier leverage ratio is well above our target finally our lcr in the fourth quarter was in terms of shareholder capital returns we continued to pay our quarterly dividend which totaled million this past quarter and are looking forward to resuming open market share repurchases in the first quarter this will be in compliance with the federal reserves modified limitations that apply to all ccar banks and allows us to repurchase approximately million of common stock in the first quarter we look forward to operating under the stress capital buffer framework which will give us more flexibility in terms of capital return turning to page my comments on net interest revenue will highlight sequential changes q4 net interest revenue was down primarily driven by the impact of lower shortterm rates and although our deposits increased significantly in the fourth quarter they had minimal nir value turning to page which summarizes deposits and securities trends deposit balances continued to grow over the course of the quarter and on average were up billion or from the third quarter and billion or from a year ago on a sequential basis a larger driver of the growth was excess liquidity in the system driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus on a yearoveryear basis strategic deposit initiatives across treasury services asset servicing and wealth management business tied to underlying transaction activity which supports our client relationships with degeneration objectives was a significant driver of growth the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits was negative basis points minimally changed from the third quarter as a reminder about onequarter of our deposits are in foreign currencies including euro and yen which had negative rates in the us our average interestbearing deposit cost was about fourfifth turning to the securities portfolio on average the portfolio was flat to the third quarter and approximately billion over the prior year or as we deploy a significant portion of the growing deposit base throughout the year as the bar chart shows to the right we continue to gradually increase our nonhqla securities to increase yields while maintaining a conservative risk profile as a result average nonhqla securities including trading assets was billion in the fourth quarter up billion from a year ago turning to page well provide you with some color on our asset mix and specifically the loan portfolio exposures and statistics at yearend were largely similar to the third quarter as a reminder our portfolio is predominantly investment grade and for the year we experienced net recovery we recorded a million provision this quarter as we internally downgraded a modest number of names primarily in our commercial real estate portfolio our assumptions around the macro outlook as well as the relative weightings of the scenarios were largely unchanged from the last quarter and we continue to closely monitor this portfolio particularly the commercial real estate exposure in other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment page provides an overview on expenses which we covered earlier turning to page as mentioned earlier total investment services revenue yearonyear declined by mostly due to the impact of low interest rates nir was down these were flat or up excluding million of fee waivers fx and other trading revenue had a strong quarter as fx revenue grew by over in investment services driven by higher volumes and volatility assets under custody andor administration increased yearoveryear to trillion and we continue to see organic growth with new and existing clients as well as the benefits from higher market values and the impact of a weaker us dollar as i move to the business line discussion ill focus my comments on fees within asset servicing fees were up modestly as higher market levels and fx and higher liquidity service fees partially offset the impact of fee waivers lumpy repricing associated with a few client renewals and lower sec lending in pershing continued strong underlying fundamentals offset the impact of fee waivers clearing accounts were up mutual fund assets up and we saw continued strong net new asset inflows of billion in the quarter transactional activity also remained high as it did for most of and we would expect that to normalize a bit as we head into issuer services fees decreased primarily due to the impact of waivers exwaivers midsingle digit growth in drs was offset by a small decline in corporate trust treasury services fees were up our payment volume growth particularly in the second half of the quarter and the increased fees also reflect an improved product mix and client wins and higher money market fund and deposit balances on the back of targeted initiatives clearance and collateral management fees were down slightly good organic growth in our nonus business where triparty balances and clearances both grew double digits was offset by declines in us volumes lower intraday financing fees and the absence of income associated with an equity investment divested last year page summarizes the key drivers that affected the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 turning to investment and wealth management on page as noted earlier total investment and wealth management revenue in the quarter increased overall assets under management grew to a record trillion and were up yearoveryear primarily due to higher market value billion of inflows and the positive impact of the us dollar weakening in the fourth quarter we had net inflows of billion including long term strategies inflows of billion driven by a second straight quarter of inflows in ldi as well as fixed income wealth management had its strongest flow quarter in two years resulting in positive organic growth in the quarter investment management revenue grew as the benefit of higher market levels and a weaker dollar were offset by the impact of fee waivers fee waivers impacted growth by about basis points wealth management fees were down due to the sale of our canadian wealth management business client assets grew to a record billion and were up yearoveryear now turning to our other segment on page the yearoveryear revenue comparison was primarily impacted by the gain of an equity investment in the fourth quarter of and a business sale loss in the current period expenses increased reflecting severance and real estate impairment charges noted earlier and now a few comments about the outlook before i turn it back over to todd first the more recent usual caveat with the macroeconomic environment remains fluid so as we think about full year for nir our guidance remains unchanged and that a run rate slightly lower than the fourth quarter call it about remains a good proxy for the quarterly run rate expected this year although recent yield curve steepening provides a modest tailwind shortterm rates have continued to decline also we expect mbs prepayment speeds to remain at current levels despite the steepening yield curve as mortgage rates have only risen slightly finally we are currently planning for average deposits for the year to be slightly lower than our fourth quarter average as we help our clients redeploy liquidity into more efficient investments on our platform for transactionrelated fees we expect volumes to normalize a bit versus healthy levels we saw in the fourth quarter on money market fee waivers we still expect to be at a full run rate in the first quarter we now however expect the impact of first quarter waivers net of distribution expense benefit to be approximately million assuming shortterm rates stay at current levels so as we think about full year fees for the entire company we expect them to be relatively flat as the impact of equity appreciation organic growth and the weaker dollar will be offset by fee waivers and lower volume excluding waivers fees would be up by the way we assume equity market will rise approximately from the beginning of regarding expenses we continue to expect them to be flat for the full year on an operating and constant currency basis but due to recent weakening of the dollar this means that in absolute terms full year expenses are now projected to increase by approximately million or this currency impact is offset by a light increase in fee revenues as previously discussed finally in terms of our effective tax rate we expect it to be approximately for specific to the first quarter the items i just mentioned will have a proportionate impact but as a reminder first quarter staff expenses are typically higher relating to longterm incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees also in the first quarter of we made an accrual adjustment that reduced the expenses that will not be repeated this year as a result we expect first quarter total expenses to be up to yearover year including the impact of currency the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 with that let me turn it back over to todd thomas p gibbons chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you emily before opening up for questions let me share some final observations speaking to slide and our franchise is powered by a wide breadth of services and capabilities this differentiates us and certainly makes us unique amongst our closest peers we are a top three provider across asset servicing issuer service clearance and collateral management as well as pershing and we rank among the leading players in more fragmented businesses such as wealth management investment management and treasury services this gives us a strong platform and scale both of which are crucial for success we are responding to the evolving needs of our clients and actively connecting different parts of the company to drive growth while significant pandemicrelated challenges remain we are entering with confidence and momentum in our core franchise at the same time overall revenues yearoveryear will be impacted by the full effect of low interest rates money market fee waivers and the absence of covidrelated transaction activity for the full year we expect to deliver modest organic fee growth similar to which we expect to accelerate beyond as our growth initiatives gain traction as we look out to i have three overarching priorities for the company one execute our growth initiatives two scaling and digitizing our operating model and three fostering a highperformance culture that is focused on delivering excellent client service in new and innovative ways while focusing on these priorities we will continue to vigilantly manage operating expenses which we expect to be flat for on a constant currency basis between and we funded approximately billion in new investments and generating internal efficiencies with no increase in expense we will continue to invest in technology although the profile spend is more focused on initiatives to grow and make the business more efficient turning to capital returns were pleased that we can resume share repurchases in the first quarter we remain committed to returning at least of earnings to shareholders over time including the excess capital we have built in second quarter of we have the capacity to drive meaningful eps growth through buybacks in conclusion we have navigated an extremely challenging year of wealth our capitalgenerative and lowrisk model delivered what it is supposed to deliver in terms of stability and capital generation im proud of the leadership team and the dedication and hard work of our employees during unprecedented and challenging times and with that operator can you please open the line for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions emily there was a lot of walkthrough there on the revenue guide so i just wanted to make sure i heard that correctly and understand where i should index you guys provide a lot of disclosure on slide is the right starting point that we use the fee revenue exfee waivers and notable items for which is the and then we layer in the different various impacts that you laid out and then take the new run rate for fee waivers expected in and then kind of annualize that is that the right way to think about it and how does the strengthening of the dollar play into that sorry emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so i guess just i wont break down each and every piece but ultimately if you look at our full year if you actually take into account weve tried to spell out as best as possible the impact of waivers likewise we are expecting an increase in our market appreciation as well as were going to have some favorability in terms of the weakening dollar if you put all of that together yearonyear revenues will be essentially flat and up ex fee waivers brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thats fee revenue brennan emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thats fee sorry thats fee revenue yeah thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and that is assuming and who knows where the dollar is going to be but we just used the spot dollar at year end brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc fair enough so the is the number we should focus on to be flat basically ex all those puts and takes the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great excellent and then expense is flat which is in line with what you gave in december on a constant currency but weve seen the weakening dollar and so when we think about the expense line if the dollar remains unchanged from where we are now and of course we can calibrate that through the year depending on the different factors well see a roughly uplift on the operating expense line from the level is that fair emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp correct correct brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay excellent thanks i just wanted to try to clarify some of that and when we think about the deposits dropping from the average level is it fair to assume that well probably shake out at a level thats above the third quarter or are you guys thinking that we might actually even revert down to that level or below is there any help you can provide in trying to think about how to gauge the magnitude of that normalization in the deposit side emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so ultimately were projecting deposits to be relatively flat from here or potentially to decline a bit now in fairness we could see excess liquidity in the system but of course we are monitoring our capital ratios and we have to optimize returns to shareholders so we will be actively very proactively managing the size of the balance sheet so thats ultimately roughly flat from here or slightly lower brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great great thanks very much for clarifying operator and well go ahead and take our next question from ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning emily just to follow up on your organic growth outlook just wondering if you could help us put in context like just what that measures right its not necessarily a stock measure of just revenue growth so like is it taking the core building blocks of the segments and just kind of like measuring the unit the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 growth and how do you put that into context with the overall fee guide right i dont know if you can maybe walk us through that thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so when we think about organic growth we define it as pretty much growth excluding market appreciation or depreciation excluding currency impact and excluding waivers so i mean thats generally how we think about it i think todd had mentioned that we and over the course of it was around between and were expecting it to remain pretty much stable at those levels and thats embedded into the fee forecast that ive just given ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay thats helpful and then just a specific question on asset servicing fees on the income statement side seeing that there was a little bit of a there was an increase in fee waivers in that ph number but even if you exclude that asset servicing was down the press release mentioned something about some repricing im just wondering if you can walk through just what happened the pushes and pulls there of why the core was down sequentially whether itd be organic growth repricing activity et cetera thank you emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so we had in asset servicing in the fourth quarter we had higher we were helped by higher market levels higher fx and other trading and higher liquidity balances but that was offset by waivers sec lending was down a bit and yes you are correct there was a bit of some lumpy repricing in the quarter ultimately we dont control actually the timing obviously of repricing we happen to have had two or three large relationships reprice on the back of renewal so we ultimately retained the business but that was a modest headwind as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then i guess just a quick followup to that is that have we rebased does it kind of build off of here or how do you think about those repricing versus renewals as you think forward thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure sure so as you all know repricing is very lumpy you will see the full impact of those repricing throughout the year but its not like weve seen anything structural or underlying change in the trend of repricing its always been a modest headwind that weve offset with greater efficiency and net new business ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator and well take our next question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 hi can you hear me thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah good morning betsy emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi okay so first question just on i think the deposit commentary wanted to get a better understanding as to why you think deposits arent going to be continuing to increase as much as they have been i mean i think the fed is still increasing the size of the balance sheet i expected you would get some benefits from that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp ph sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think ill start and then im sure emily will join in on this i would expect that the fed is going to continue to buy securities which kind of adds to the deposit base and theres still some question exactly how the very large balances that sit at the us treasury at the fed whether theyre going to wind those down so the two of them could increase the overall reserves and deposits in the system that being said we can manage some of that and now that were back in and we did that a number of years ago so we targeted some of the less valuable balances and once were able to use our capital thats not how were going to use it it wont be particularly efficient so weve demonstrated that we can do that and of course any valuable deposits will take on but if theyre just short term with very little benefit to them well discourage them betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats via pricing or what have you i guess the other question todd is you mentioned one of the strategies here that youre going to be executing on this year is to increase the efficiency and delivery of the products and services and i wanted to understand how youre thinking about that with regard to some of the occ rules that have been out there recently regarding stable coin im just wondering is how much does the blockchain initiatives that youve got underway drive that efficiency improvement or is that more of a hobby and does it matter that the occ has approved banks for stable coin does that factor into your strategy thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think it clarifies things a bit and there is a fair amount of activity and by the way we have appointed somebody in front of what ill call the tokenization efforts theyre really across three fronts and we are seeing the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 some acceleration around tokenized assets tokenized fiat currencies and also cryptocurrency so were seeing a lot more interest in cryptocurrency and customizing and other services associated with it weve done a little bit there we have been a custodian for a big futures contract and its kind of like getting it started in terms of tokenized currency weve been a member of utility settlement coin which now indiscernible mixed development from the beginning and we do see that having a meaningful application and were also involved in tokenizing assets and were looking at what we might be able to do to tokenize into triparty repo to make it even more efficient so i think its going to be an important element were investing not hugely in it right now i dont see a lot of imminent revenues but its something that we will definitely be on the forefront on betsy you still there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh thank you yes appreciate that operator and well move to our next question from brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi great thanks good morning folks just a quick one on the net interest revenue outlook i think you were implying it after a drop in versus would be the guidance would be stable for just wondering what the headwinds are if we are if we do have a steeper yield curve i guess is the forward curve your assumption with that and then what would be the headwinds that would keep that stable if we were to see a steeping yield curve and lower prepaid fees as we go throughout the year emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure hi brian so youve got that spot on our guidance is take the fourth quarter run rate discount that call it about and thats a good proxy not only for the first quarter but when you think through the average run rate for the year at least based on what we know now we dont try to get cute we just use the forward curve and despite a steepening of the curve were still very sensitive to shortend rates which have actually come down also when you think about where we play the duration of our investments that part of the curve is actually not up as much as the longer end and i guess the last thing i would just point out about prepayment speeds which youve mentioned is that despite a steepening of the curve we really havent seen mortgage rates increase that much so were not expecting those at the moment anyway to really decline much so thats really all of this of course is subject to change based on the rate environment but thats how were projecting brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats clear and then my second question thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 hey brian ill just add just to make sure its perfectly clear i mean when you think about the steepness of the yield curve weve seen that but weve also seen shortterm rates come in a little bit and thats meaningful so if we do continue to see it and we continue to and that starts to slow down prepayment speeds or given mortgage spreads were to widen a little bit then we would expect prepayment speeds to slow down but all we do is we use the current markets expected future rates really the forward curve so thats whats in that estimate brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right okay that really makes sense and maybe todd just going back to some of the initiatives you mentioned in the early part of the call and trying to triangulate that with the organic growth rate so the organic growth rate i think that implies ph rough numbers around million of organic revenue expectations for and then you mentioned i wrote down five different initiatives the fronttoback mandate the data vault esg investment analytics the collateral management money market from triparty repo solution and the commercial payments realtime payments system as well just to get a flavor are those contributing more to i guess if we could sort of frame what portion of the organic revenue growth in may be attributable to that or is it really more for building that in and we can see potentially the organic growth rate improving in as a result of these initiatives thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean a little bit of both so part of the we had a very strong sales quarter in the fourth quarter but most of those wont be implemented brian until the end toward the end of the year so theyre going to have de minimis impact on the revenues for this year but theyll go into next year some of those are because of what weve done around data and analytics the data vault and ph you know janus henderson theyre an early adopter and so that will take some time to implement and then we think were gaining some additional traction when we look at some of the applications weve had many many many demonstrations and many users on a trial basis for example on our esg app so thats starting to build some momentum the collateral management program that were investing in we dont expect we expect to start seeing some of the benefits of that towards the end of the year so theres a little benefit in the organic growth rate this year and we would expect that to accelerate a bit next year brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay fair enough thank you operator operator instructions well take our next question from mike mayo from wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning mike emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hello mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc a question on one positive trend one maybe negative trend but on the negative trend you said you had elevated transaction volumes in pershing and they should moderate have they moderated already and what kind of see through do you have to the market situation if those transaction volumes are moderating and on the positive side you said asset servicing you had the best sales in quarters in the fourth quarter and that should help in about a year how are you able to close these deals in the pandemic environment i mean are you closing deals over zoom are these existing relationships because i keep hearing like getting new relationships is tough so just wanted some color behind both of those trends thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah no we one of the big transactions that were closing was entirely virtual and a lot of these have been entirely virtual and weve built a very good relationship with that particular organizations large european asset manager in fact right before the pandemic right at the time i was going to travel to see them and unfortunately was unable to do it so there have been from soup to nuts things slowed down for a while but its getting a little more normalized on the institutional front id say on the wealth front with individuals thats a little bit more challenging mike but on the institutional front its certainly not ideal but weve had many instances of where weve been able to handle that in terms of your question around pershing i mean were only a couple of weeks into the new year and volumes generally have stayed pretty strong relative to the fourth quarter i just think thats a little bit too early to call our estimate is that they would normalize a bit maybe they wont maybe well stay up here but thats our best guess at this point you had a third question in there and i dont recall what it was mike but ill try to take it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just a readthrough the capital markets when you think things settle down but it sounds like they havent settled down yet based on what youre seeing with pershing thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think thats right i think youre seeing more retail activity than youve historically seen the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great all right thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks mike operator well take our next question from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great hey good morning todd good morning emily just a followup around the organic growth target that you guys put out there of can you talk a little bit about what youre assuming for pricing dynamics within that across sort of your various businesses obviously it sounds like q4 maybe was a little bit of an anomaly of several large accounts just kind of happened to reprice at the same time but maybe give us a sense kind of what like that unit repricing looks like is it kind of what that is and how do you incorporate that into your guidance thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily why dont you take that do you want to take it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure ill start and please add so i mean repricing pressure is just the norm in our businesses so its always a headwind but a very modest headwind and we routinely always actually offset that more than offset that with greater efficiency and net new business so we dont look there has been some lumpy repricing but we dont see any underlying structural change or trend so from that perspective its not hugely material thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and part of our pricing schedules too are graduated so as the value of the assets increase the pricing does reflect that volume but this is specific to repricing top existing clients as they benefit from some of the operating efficiencies and the growth in their own business and typically its been fairly stable for a number of years the downdraft on that it was just a little lumpy this year we see it going back to normal but that lumpiness will have a little bit of an impact on the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it understood and then just a clarification around nir sounds like you guys are assuming mbs prepayments will remain at current levels for can you just remind us what premium amortization was in the fourth quarter and any sort of sensitivity you guys can provide around that with respect to prepayment speeds emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp indiscernible top of my head you have it yeah emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp im afraid im going to misquote but i think lets follow up with hr with ir sorry alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay sounds great thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks alex operator well take our next question from rajiv bhatia from morningstar please go ahead rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research hey good morning just a quick question on the pershing lov within pershing how does your revenue growth compare in independent brokerdealer clearing channel versus ria custody and how big of a headwind is consolidation within the independent brokerdealer space by selfclearing firms like lpl thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah and so we are growing faster in the registered advisory firms than the brokerdealer side of the business but the brokerdealer side of the business is still meaningful and its a large component of it and so as we look into next year some of the consolidations or the ph selfplanning decisions have offset the very strong growth that weve seen so thats going to be a little bit of a drag for pershing for this year its basically offsetting but the pipeline continues to be very strong especially in the advisory space rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research got it thanks the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp todd just going back if alex is still on the call just i didnt have it at my fingertips mbs prepayment speeds or mbs prepayments were about a headwind of million in the quarter and yes you are correct we just are expecting despite a steepening yield curve at the moment for that to remain stable thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp rajiv do you have a followup question rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research no thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay thank you operator well take our next question from brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking the followup todd just want to circle back on the fronttoback mandate that you indiscernible largest of the ones that youve been servicing but just wanted to get a flavor of how many others that youre doing given that you are integrated with virtually all of the oms providers or is that a sizeable type of mandate for you if we consider other contract wins and maybe indiscernible thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay sure so i mean weve integrated now with six oms platforms partnerships with bloomberg aladdin and so forth and through that were offering custody insights information around liquidity and its kind of unique capability that were able to do transactions holdings and so forth and i think what it does is it very much enriches the experience of doing business with us so i think its helped us to retain relationships i think its helped us to grow a couple of relationships that ive just indicated so we are starting to get some traction with it moving on to the data business which weve been in for some time but now weve cloudenabled it and made a much richer capability weve had a number of large beta clients that have been operating it and were now starting to convert some of them so i think its not just what they can do with us but for the first time now were starting to see some meaningful wins that i would attribute maybe not entirely to it but certainly that was a helpful driver brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and just real quick on pershing consolidation in the ria space can you actually benefit from that or is that mostly a do you see most of the providers going to a selfclearing option the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah as we look back historically more often were winners to it but there can be just bad luck and so either the acquirer was selfclearing or had some other approach or some other provider so typically we found that we have won more recently we had a couple of losses brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay good thank you thank you for the follow up thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator we will take our next question from brian kleinhanzl from kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks i was wondering if you could just kind of walk through again the tier leverage comments that you made you had said that this quarter where it was at i think you gave that your target was to but then you said you thought you were well above where you needed to be it seems like youre just above kind of what your targets are so how does that impact your aspirations for capital return emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so tier leverage is i think weve been pretty clear that were comfortable running more at a rate between to so that does imply that we have significant excess capital and you can assume that were going to look to return that to shareholders over the course of the year if were permitted to do so thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey brian the other i would add to that brian is that we have excess deposits right now emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp right thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and so since were not able to do anything with our capital were not really pushing them away or managing them as carefully as we could once we get back into a normal capital management cycle deposits that arent worth anything were not going to keep them here brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2021 and so then when you talk about the deposits how does that play into the money market fee waivers are you anticipating pushing those off into the money market funds which have been the driver of the fees waivers or if that were to happen that could be an incremental negative to the fees waiver guidance emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure i can take that so i mean the fee waiver guidance and the increase in that is really tied to what were seeing in the short end and tbill rates and repo rates have actually come down since we originally projected and thats really what the million now that i mentioned you are correct with a lot of excess reserves if that all ends up in money markets that could ultimately put more pressure so that is a potential risk the one thing also just while were on waivers that i just would highlight is that pershing did hit its full run rate in terms of waivers in the fourth quarter so you will start to see those waivers increase in other lines of business so asset servicing issuer services im treasury services for example thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so brian if money market mutual funds increased as the balance has increased we would certainly waive more fees but netnet wed have more fees and so its just that we would its of the component that we get so theyve basically been relatively stable so when we do these comparisons the volumes have been relatively flat so that hasnt created any noise so if money has moved into money market funds there probably will be much less fees than they typically would have been but therell probably still be some fees brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator and with that that does that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp that was our last question operator operator and that does conclude our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the call back over to todd for any additional or closing remarks thomas p gibbons chief executive officer director the bank of new york
