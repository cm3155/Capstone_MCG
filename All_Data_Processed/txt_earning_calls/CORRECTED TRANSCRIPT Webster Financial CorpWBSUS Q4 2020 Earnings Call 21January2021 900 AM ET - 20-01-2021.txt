financial corp thanks terry good morning everyone thank you for joining websters fourth quarter earnings call cfo glenn macinnes and i will review business financial and credit performance for the quarter after which hsa bank president chad wilkins and jason soto our chief credit officer will join us for qa as we look back on a challenging year for all of us in so many different ways my first thought is how proud i am of webster bankers as they found a way to deliver for each other our customers our communities and for our shareholders while increasing covid cases continue to present real challenges we are optimistic that will bring a level of normalization as the distribution of vaccines dramatically changes the path of the pandemic the broader economy including covidimpacted sectors continue to recover and the peaceful transition of power that occurred yesterday hopefully represents the beginning of a lessdivisive political environment we remain focused on prudently managing capital credit and liquidity as we also position ourselves for growth and outperformance as the macro environment improves in and beyond turning to slide im really pleased with our strong business performance in the quarter we originated billion in loans generated strong loanrelated fees continued to grow deposits and hsa total footings approached billion credit trends are favorable and the net interest margin has stabilized our adjusted earnings per share in q4 were up from a year ago our fourth quarter performance includes million of pretax charges related to the strategic initiatives we announced last quarter glenn will provide additional perspective on these charges in his remarks webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 an improved economic outlook with continued uncertainty along with a flat quarteroverquarter loan portfolio supported a million cecl allowance release in the quarter our fourth quarter adjusted return on common equity was and the adjusted return on tangible common equity in the quarter was on slide loans grew from a year ago or when excluding billion in ppp loans commercial loans grew from a year ago or more than million deposits grew yearoveryear driven across all business lines loan yield increased basis points linkedquarter while deposit costs continue to decline slides through set forth key performance statistics for our three lines of business im on slide this is a very strong quarter for commercial banking with more than billion of loan originations up solidly from q3 and down only slightly from a strong loan fundings of million were also up solidly from q3 we continue to benefit from our industry expertise and deep relationships in select sectors including technology that have not been adversely impacted during the pandemic commercial bank deposits are at record levels up more than from the prior years fourth quarter the commercial banking loan portfolio yield increased basis points in the quarter driven by better spreads and enhanced by a higher level of acceleration of deferred fees as we saw payoff activity return to more normalized levels noninterest income in commercial banking was up linkedquarter due to higher syndication and other fees tied to the strong origination activity now turning to hsa bank on slide hsa bank total footings increased from a year ago and now total nearly billion core deposits were up and excluding the state farm acquisition which closed in the yearoveryear increase in balances was driven by continued contributions as well as reduced accountholder spending due to covid19 restrictions the tpa accounts declined from a year ago reflecting the expected departures that occurred in q3 we added accounts in fewer than we added in consistent with industry trends and due primarily to lower enrollments with existing employers as covid19 impacted the overall employment environment we expect this trend to continue into the first half of the new year hsa deposit costs continue to decline as we remain disciplined in this lowinterest rate environment and totaled basis points in the quarter im now on slide community banking loans grew yearoveryear and declined excluding ppp as indicated on the slide ppp loans decreased million as we saw repayment and forgiveness activity again in the quarter community banking deposits grew yearoveryear with consumer and business deposits growing and respectively deposit costs continued to decline and totaled basis points in the quarter net interest income grew million from a year ago driven by overall loan and deposit growth the next two slides address credit metrics and trends which continue to be surprisingly stable given all the challenges in the macro environment on slide we show our commercial loan sectors most directly impacted by covid overall loan outstandings to these sectors have declined from september and payment deferrals have declined million or on slide we provide more detail across our billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio the key takeaway here is that payment deferrals declined by to million at december and now represent of total loans compared to of total loans at september at yearend million or of the million in payment deferrals are firsttime deferrals and cares act and interagencystatementdefined webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 payment deferrals which are included in the million of total payment deferrals at december decreased from september and now stand at million while challenges related to the pandemic and the overall economy remain i am pleased with the considerable support we have been able to provide to our customers as they work through these challenging times we continue to actively monitor risk make realtime credit rating decisions and address potential credit issues proactively we remain confident about the quality of our risk selection and our underwriting processes our portfolio management capabilities and our capital position ill now turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks john i will focus on the key aspects of performance in the quarter including stable adjusted net interest margin an increase in noninterest income ongoing expense control and a favorable credit profile ill begin with our average balance sheet on slide average securities grew million or linkedquarter securities represented of total assets at december average loans declined million or linked quarter primarily driven by million decline in consumer loans reflecting higher paydown rates in mortgage and home equity portfolios prepayment and forgiveness on ppp loans during the quarter totaled million in q4 we recognized million of ppp deferred fee accretion and the remaining deferred fee balance totaled million at december deposits increased million linkedquarter primarily driven by growth in community banking and hsa this was partially offset by a reduction in cds the strong growth in deposits allowed us to pay down borrowings which were lower by million from q3 at billion borrowings represent of total assets compared to at september and in prior year the tangible common equity ratio increased to and will be basis points higher excluding the billion riskweighted ppp loans tangible book value per share at quarter end was an increase of about from september and from prior year slide highlights adjustments to reported net income aggregate adjustments totaled million pretax or million aftertax representing per share of the million in adjustments million is related to our strategic initiatives which john will discuss further the remaining million is associated with the debt prepayment the prepayment expense adversely impacted current quarter net interest income and impacted net interest margin by basis points however we will benefit by approximately million in net interest income per quarter and nim will benefit by basis points on slide we provide our reported and adjusted income statement as highlighted on the previous page the adjustments total million pretax on an adjusted basis net interest income increased by million from prior quarter this was a result of a million reduction in deposit and borrowing costs along with million in additional loan income which was partially offset by a million decline in securities income primarily as a result of elevated prepayments taken together our adjusted net interest margin of was flat to third quarter as compared to prior year net interest income declined by million million of the decline was the net result of lower market rates and was partially offset by interest income of million from earning asset growth and million from a reduction in borrowings webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 noninterest income increased million linkedquarter and million from prior year loan fees increased million from prior quarter as a result of higher syndication prepayment and line usage fees other income increased million reflecting higher direct investment income and swap fees hsa fee income decreased million linkedquarter as q3 included million of exit fees on tpa accounts mortgage banking revenues decreased million linkedquarter as a result of lower volume on loans originated for sale the million increase in noninterest income from prior year reflects additional loan fees higher mortgage banking revenue and hsa fee income partially offset by lower deposit service fees noninterest expense of million reflects an increase of million primarily due to technology and seasonal increases in temporary staffing to support the hsa annual enrollment noninterest expense decreased million or from prior year and our efficiency ratio was in the quarter preprovision net revenue was million in q4 this compares to million in q3 and million in prior year our cecl provision in the quarter reflects a credit of million which ill discuss in more detail on the next slide and our adjusted tax rate was turning to slide ill review the results of our fourth quarter allowance for loan losses under cecl the allowance coverage ratio excluding ppp loans declined from to with total reserves of million the reserve balance reflects our lifetime estimate of credit losses the small decline from prior quarter is the net effect of an improvement in the macroeconomic forecast partially offset by additional qualitative reserves the increase in qualitative reserves is driven by uncertainty around the resolution of the pandemic and the pace of the recovery the total reserves provide a more adverse scenario than shown in the baseline assumptions at the bottom of the page slide highlights our key asset quality metrics as of december nonperforming loans in the upper left increased million from q3 commercial residential mortgage and consumer each saw linkedquarter declines while commercial real estate increased net chargeoffs in the upper right decreased from the third quarter and totaled million after million in recoveries the net chargeoff rate was basis points in the quarter commercial classified loans in the lower left increased million from q3 and represented basis points of total commercial loans slide highlights our liquidity metrics our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with considerable flexibility deposit growth of million exceeded total asset growth and lowered the loanto deposit ratio to our sources of secured borrowing capacity increased further and totaled billion at december slide highlights our strong capital metrics regulatory capital ratios exceed wellcapitalized levels by substantial amounts our common equity tier ratio of exceeds wellcapitalized by billion likewise tier riskbased capital of exceeds wellcapitalized levels by million our guidance will continue to be impacted by the pace and duration of the pandemic over the next few quarters that being said we anticipate modest loan growth excluding the timing of ppp forgiveness and round two originations webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 nim will also be influenced by the rate environment and ppp forgiveness assuming todays rates we would expect net interest income to be around q4s level noninterest income will be modestly lower linkedquarter driven by lower loanrelated and mortgage banking fees the provision for credit losses will continue to be impacted by credit trends the macroeconomic environment government stimulus and the duration of the pandemic core operating expenses will be lower as we begin to recognize the benefits of our strategic initiatives and our tax rate will be approximately to with that ill turn things back over to john for a review of our strategic initiatives john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks glenn im on slide as we discussed on the october earnings call weve been working through a comprehensive strategic and organizational review since before the onset of the pandemic and while today well provide more detail on our progress and some shorterterm financial targets i want to stress that the work weve done over the last year and the actions we are taking are transforming our company and the way we do business we believe that we will continue delivering incremental value to our customers and shareholders for years to come consistent with our overarching objectives of maximizing economic profits and creating longterm franchise value importantly these actions afford us the capacity to invest in the future and provide better customer experiences through improved products services and digital offerings all in the furtherance of our mission to help individuals families and businesses achieve their financial goals were investing in revenue growth drivers that leverage our differentiated businesses these include accelerating growth in new and existing commercial banking segments improving sales productivity enhancing noninterest income through treasury and commercial card products and driving deeper relationships across all lines of business while we anticipate shortterm benefits from these initiatives they will contribute meaningfully to our financial performance in and beyond additionally we continue to invest in technology to provide better digital experiences for our customers and bankers to further improve customer acquisition and retention rates as shown on slide we have made significant progress on our efficiency opportunities we remain on track to deliver an to reduction in core noninterest expense we expect this to be fully realized on a run rate basis by the end of the fourth quarter of our efficiency initiatives fall into three areas of focus that we discussed last quarter rationalizing retail and commercial estate simplifying the structure of the organization and optimizing our ancillary spend weve taken actions to simplify our organizational structure including combining like functions automating manual processes and selectively outsourcing commoditized activities a portion of the projectrelated expense adjustments that glenn discussed relate to these actions and the associated severance costs result from a targeted reduction in the overall workforce we announced in december the consolidation of banking centers and we have targeted actions aimed at reducing corporate office square footage over time the real estate optimization plan reflects our response to changes in customer preferences and the shift in workplace dynamics that have only accelerated during the pandemic the remaining quarterly costbenefits will be driven by a more disciplined approach to ancillary spend redesigning and automating internal critical processes and leveraging backoffice synergies webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 slide provides an overview of the cost savings and an expense walk to our fourth quarter target run rate achieving these efficiencies will allow us to continue to invest in our franchise and improve the customer experience the last slide for me is an important one weve updated it from prior quarters it aggregates our activities during related to helping our employees our consumer and business customers and the communities we serve navigate an extraordinarily challenging time this is what the webster way is all about i have to thank each of our bankers for their dedication perseverance and hard work during the pandemic and through a period of transformation the commitment to our customers our shareholders and to each other has enabled webster to continue to differentiate itself and before we go to qa id like to take a moment to share with you all that today is terry mangans last earnings call as he will be retiring on march many of us and many of you have had the pleasure of working with terry over his 18year career at webster terrys efforts have been recognized at the national level by institutional investor as a top investor relations professional i want to thank terry personally for a significant and longlasting contributions that have helped our organization navigate through exciting fun and challenging times with that daryl glenn chad jason and i are prepared to take questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first questions come from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp steve good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on the strategic plan and appreciate the million of projected cost saves being called out by john can you give us an idea or maybe glenn in terms of the timing of that recognition through the year im just trying to get a better sense of when these cost saves will work into the run rate through the year john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yes steve ill take a shot and then glenn can add some more context as he said first quarter expenses should show the beginning of our expense moves the second quarter when the banking center consolidations are complete and many of the employee actions will be complete will be the real time where well see a more dramatic shift in expenses and then we see more savings in the third and fourth quarter so without giving you webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 kind of a specific scorecard id say first quarter will be modest youll see a bigger drop in the second and third quarters getting to that final run rate target steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then maybe for glenn i appreciate the nii guidance for the first quarter but if we think about the forward curve how are you thinking about the trajectory of margin through the year and specifically im hoping you comment on the additional opportunity maybe to pay down additional borrowings glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah so thanks steve and good morning so i think i would look at two things one is that as i highlighted in my prepared remarks we did see a sort of increase in prepayment speeds particularly on the cmbs portfolio and you see that reflected when you look at the yield on the treasury portfolio so thats something thats changed and i think thats industry wide so a little bit of pressure on nim there on core nim there as far as borrowings we do have the opportunity based on yearend to pay down probably another up to million in borrowings now those are all shortterm lowrate borrowings i think the weighted cost is somewhere around basis points so thats sort of what i would say is point a point b would be on the funding side we still have about million in cds coming due in the first quarter and thats at basis points and those will typically reprice down to the lets say to basis points for the full year we have about billion in cds that are coming due at basis points so its probably basis points to be had on that as well so if i look at core nim im looking at core nim in the range of bouncing around from like to give or take now the wild cards of course going to be liquidity and the stimulus as more money flows into the market depending on the final bill we could be left with a lot municipalities and businesses with a lot more liquidity and to the extent we dont see the loan growth youd have to park that money at the fed or invest some of it so were constantly looking at those alternatives steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful then maybe one final one assuming chads there so hsa account growth was a bit soft in can you talk about the outlook for and maybe any early reads given the enrollment season that wrapped thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp sure chad ill throw that directly over to you if thats okay charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank operating management committee webster financial corp yeah thats great thanks john thanks steve yeah steve if youve been tracking our account growth over the last three quarters weve been down about to over prior periods due to the impact of the pandemic on the economy and the labor markets were seeing similar trends in our enrollments as core new accounts for january and trending to q1 are about behind last year at this point webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 most of the or all the weakness actually really is in our new accounts from existing employers which weve stated before represents about of our account generation and so as of the latest information new accounts hsa accounts from existing employers are down about but as weve talked in prior calls were having a very good new employer sales season so were up about in our enrollments with new employers coming on board so in aggregate were down about which again is in line with the reductions weve seen since the pandemic started in q2 and it seems to be consistent across the industry steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and before i sign off congrats to terry i cant wait to get a copy of your book thanks everybody john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks thanks steve operator thank you our next questions come from the line of chris oconnell with kbw please proceed with your questions christopher oconnell jr q analyst keefe bruyette woods good morning gentlemen and congratulations to terry on your retirement john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks chris its good to hear from you strange to see a different name than collyns since before the financial crisis quite a long streak but were glad to have you on the call christopher oconnell jr q analyst keefe bruyette woods absolutely so just circling back maybe to chad following up on the last question was that just referring on those percentages to account growth and if so do you have a readthrough as to what the deposit balances might be doing with enrollment season in the first quarter john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah ill just say hi we mentioned the deposits really havent tracked along with accounts because of obviously additional seasoning of the accounts but also because during the pandemic really slowed a lot of the spend out of the accounts so theyre a little i wont say artificially higher but in essence they are because there hasnt been too much spend but chad maybe you can put a finer point on what looks like or what the year looked like with respect to deposits webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 okay chad just dropped from the call so chris what i would say is we said deposits were up about and respectively if you take out the state farm acquisition its its and so while accounts were generally flat if you add back the tpa accounts and our new account growth was as chad said about behind the prior year we still had significant growth in deposits and were seeing pretty significant growth in deposits in the first quarter too more similar to last year glenn can give you the dollar amount but there is that interesting dynamic that the reason that accounts and deposits are kind of separating a bit is because theres not as much money swipes to the individual accounts because people arent getting as many elective medical services as they had before the pandemic glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp and i would just add i mean our forecast and its still relatively early our forecast for deposits quarterover quarter so fourth quarter at the end of the first quarter somewhere between million to million at this point john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp i think we have chad back i dont know chad if you heard us anything you wanted else you wanted to say about kind of deposits i talked about them kind of splitting off from account growth because of certain pandemic related trends okay hes not on well move on chris does that answer your question christopher oconnell jr q analyst keefe bruyette woods yeah no thats fine thats great the million to million i think is a good starting point and then you guys have mentioned i think kind of modest loan growth outlook at least near term as you kind of go through the course of and obviously the environment is kind of constantly changing at this point but where are you guys seeing loan growth demand and where are you most comfortable growing loans at to this point john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah chris i think thats a great question and i always give this answer that every quarter we seem to have significant rises in payoffs or lower payoffs or big spikes in originations and lo and behold even in a pandemic year you look at commercial loan growth and its approaching that to that we kind of are able to produce year in and year out and i always talk to you guys about all the different levers we have both geographically and in different sectors and across asset classes fourth quarter was interesting we didnt see overall balance sheet loan growth at the bank but we saw actually outflow of mortgage refi even though our activity was pretty high and while we had really high originations for what we thought was going to be a pandemicmuted fourth quarter we also had significant payoffs and so while fourth quarter was driven really by great commercial real estate growth fourth quarter was driven by great sponsor and specialty growth particularly in the technology and healthcare sectors so as we look forward i think there may be still a little bit of uncertainty in the real estate market obviously some property types retail we dont do a lot of theres not opportunity right now and lot of uncertainty in hotel and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 so you think about mixed use industrial office and i think a lot of our key really great real estate investors are kind of taking a pause so i would say the pipelines there are okay but not great i still think technology and healthcare will drive a good amount of growth our middle market and municipality and institutional business has really been solid during this time in this rate environment and we think thatll continue so i would say look to ci more than commercial real estate would be my guess and then as it relates i think one of the reasons glenn talks about modest is because while we do see some pipeline we also see some forecasted payoff activity and so thatll be the wildcard on whether we can actually significantly grow the loan book christopher oconnell jr q analyst keefe bruyette woods got it thats helpful thats all i had thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks chris charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank operating management committee webster financial corp hey john im back on by the way sorry i got kicked off here john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp its all right chad operator thank you so much our next questions come from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thanks good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning just going back to the earlier question on the hsa business it seems like just stepping back a bit much of the slower growth is covidrelated in one way or another whats your sense of for example if we were to get vaccine efficacy midyear when does the hsa business kind of shake off this hangover john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 yeah ill take a shot and ill give it to chad i think again let me put a high perspective on it we are still so bullish on the business our trends are consistent with what we can read at least through to the periodic indiscernible report and what our pure play competitors report in conferences it does seem to be an industry sector experience that were seeing i think i want to put a finer point on what chad said before that really the slowdown in account growth was almost entirely related to existing customers we have not signing up as many new accounts and new employers because of the employment market right many companies arent hiring some companies are shedding employees and so i do think that the good news for us is that during the pandemic we actually had our best year in terms of driving new large employer wins and so while accounts per employer are down were adding customers and so as the economy rebounds as the employment market changes as confidence gets out there and theres more activity we feel like well naturally be able to capture new accounts through the new employers weve gotten i think my best guess would be like everything else but we look to the second half of when there is a little bit more activity and then as we recall there may be some pentup demand for medical procedures which could also mute deposit growth over time but we think thats when we might get more activity in the market chad i dont know if you disagree or if you have anything further to provide there charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank operating management committee webster financial corp thats exactly right john we think that everything will come back to prepandemic levels as the economy opens up and we get beyond the pandemic and you hit all the key points and just to hit what was audio gap im not sure exactly how you answered that john but to add to that yeah were seeing similar deposit growth that we saw last year in the first quarter so we expect first quarter to be about the same but one of the things we need to keep in mind is the tpa accounts we expect about of the deposits and accounts to roll off as we go through the rest of the year not so much in the first quarter but the rest of the year john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks chad brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and quick accounting kind of followup for glenn the loss on hedge terminations million did that flow through nii or was that glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc it did webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so theres two components one is a break fee which is that flows through income the remainder flows through net interest income that was worth about basis points on the margin brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great i wanted to clarify that i think thats important okay thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks brock operator thank you our next questions come from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please proceed with your questions mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning and congratulations terry john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp good morning mark terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp thank you mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co for you john is on the expense initiatives im curious if you think theres even more room to kind of push cost and efficiency ratios lower given the increased digitization of the business once you complete this optimization program do you think you can drive efficiency even lower john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp we do mark and we thought about how to present this youll see on page it really represents the low end of the to range we do think that well be able to achieve the full in that range and as we move into continue to become more efficient and lower the unit cost of delivery one of the things i want to be clear about is that were not about generating shareholder value through cost cutting what we want to do is make sure that we can continue to drive our differentiated commercial banking business and our hsa business and our community bank business and grow over time so hopefully we continue to be more and more efficient on a unit cost basis mark over time webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 our goal obviously is if we do get a lift in rates and loan growth comes back significantly we want to be prepared to be able to expand commercial banking hire new commercial bankers continue to invest in technology so our real dollar level of cost may go up but ultimately we want to achieve operating leverage deliver this really significant step in lowering our cost structure and then over time continue to drive efficiencies both on the cost line and by generating operating leverage and higher revenues mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co great and then secondly can you update us on how youre thinking about geographic expansion and maybe share some thoughts on whether your view with respect to ma has changed obviously you have a strong currency now im curious how youre thinking about ma john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah its interesting i think from a geographic expansion perspective its always on our drawing board and we have paused obviously in this unique environment over the last few years in kind of a credit frenzy first a lot of competition and now obviously the pandemic i could see us expanding in contiguous geographic metro markets to go into middle market as you know we have a significant national presence in our key industry sector specialties which i think weve proven over time we know how to select risk and we have really deep knowledge there so weve been able to maintain good growth and expansion without planting flags in others cities but we do see that as part of the tool of expanding commercial banking over time with respect to ma its interesting i got a lot of feedback from the last call that i had pivoted and i certainly didnt mean to i mean i think the answer for us is always as you know were very confident in the fact that we believe weve got differentiated businesses that we need to exploit over time and we need to continue to invest in and so we think we can grow organically over time weve also said that scale matters and that if there were a really really compelling opportunity in hsa or from a whole bank perspective that had great strategic and financial merit to it obviously we would look at it but i will tell you that this bank right now particularly mark as you can imagine undergoing the transformation were going through right now is completely focused internally at making sure that we drive value that we take care of our customers and take care of our own business and then well look at opportunities if they arise mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks mark operator thank you our next questions come from the line of jared shaw of wells fargo please proceed with your questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everyone this is timur braziler filling in for jared john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp hey timur good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning maybe starting first on the allowance just wondering how heavy did you guys lean on the qualitative overlays in keeping the allowance at somewhat of an artificially elevated level and as we go forward how should we think about applying these qualitative overlays and what type of pace of reserve release could we see if the economic backdrop and credit picture remains unchanged glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so hey timur good morning its glenn let me take that and then john could add some color but id first start by saying the quantitative method still represent a significant majority of our total allowance so thats the first thing to keep in context and i think with respect to qualitative adjustments i think in this environment heightened level of uncertainty you probably would expect to see a higher percentage of qualitative versus quantitative to account for the unknown and so i think the other thing to keep in perspective is through the months of the pandemic our customer performance has been very different than prior recessions and the qualitative factors help address the risk outside the model and so that we dont specifically disclose the qualitative reserve but as you probably saw on our k its driven by such factors like credit concentration credit quality trends the quality of internal loan reviews nature and volume of the portfolio staffing letters underwriting recessions and economic considerations that are not reflected in the base so thats john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp i think thats great i mean thats you obviously timur you should be in any one of these banks and seen the processes that weve all built to try and leverage lots of data and models and so its primarily quantitatively driven the reality if i can step back just from an industry perspective right is for all of us with a mid exogenous shock in gdp in the second quarter all the models overpredicted the quantitative models overpredicted losses because youre plugging in a moodys model youre plugging in gdp youre plugging in unemployment and obviously we hadnt seen that in prior history that it predicted shortterm significant losses that just werent going to come and now what youre seeing on the other side is a little bit of the opposite right where youve got forwardlooking improved economic outlook not a lot of loan growth so most banks have a pretty consistent portfolio theyre not having to provide very much for new loans and the models probably predict too much of a relief given the significant uncertainty around things like new strains of the virus the distribution and efficacy of the vaccines webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 whats are we going to get the kind of government stimulus thats targeting the right areas and so theres still a decent amount of uncertainty in there but glenns right the process remains the key for all the banks is to just have the right repeatable modeled quantitativedriven process and then be able to use some level of quantitative factors to make sure that what you see and what is really happening doesnt overpredict or underpredict future losses and ive been surprised quite frankly just editorially looking at all of our peers and others and what youre seeing in the midcap space kind of theres a general theme of really small provisions to small releases somewhere in that margin so we seem to be consistent with a lot of the peers as well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right and could that accelerate if the loan growth doesnt reengage in lets say the next two quarters can we see an acceleration of reserve releases as some of that uncertainty rolls off or are you going to try and maintain some of those balances and incorporate future loan growth into that amount john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so loan growth is one variable and so i think so thats one thing we look at in addition to the economic conditions the credit quality risk migration and then you got the other factors like government stimulus and things like that potentially been down the road so its hard to say but look i think the million total allowance that we ended the year is our best estimate it is the sum of primarily quantitative methods and then supplemented with qualitative methods to account for uncertainty timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thank you and then last one for me just on the second round of ppp any kind of guidance you guys can provide for us on what kind of magnitude we should be expecting out of the second round or is it still too early to tell john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp its probably a little too early to call but jason i dont know if you want to provide a little perspective on that i got some more stats this morning i mean were active and theres a good number of applications we have jason do you have some color on that jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp yeah yeah so the first couple of days here we received over applications about million in total volume weve processed a good portion of those and ready to start submitting to the sba so i think overall i would say we probably dont expect the same level of activity as we had last time around but the early start has been pretty good timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 okay thank you and go indiscernible john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of laurie hunsicker with compass point please proceed with your questions laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah hi thanks good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc i just want to say terry its been a great great pleasure working with you over the years glenn first question for you on the deferrals and i love the detail you give can you just help us understand a little bit maybe more broadly and any color you can give around the hotel book it seems like weve only seen sort of two categories where weve seen the upticks understandably but just if you can help us with any details on that million book what the ltv is where theyre located whats flagged any color you can share with us around that and just maybe the uptick going from million to million john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp sure jason ill throw that right to you if thats okay jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp yeah yeah no thats fine so looking at the book right if you step back its really six or seven deals that make up that population and theres really only two deals that are in active deferral in that population and both of those are paying interest right theyre not paying principal weve given that deferral and the recovery we expect it to be slow but weve seen some support and willingness by the sponsors or the owners to put some money into those just to keep it going and time will tell right and so its not a huge exposure were not overly concerned about it but we are obviously monitoring it closely and going in just to answer your question the ltv going into the cycle and obviously wed all acknowledge theres been some impact here but going into is about laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then of your hotel book the million how much of that is cre versus ci webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp its all cre john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp all cre laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc all cre okay perfect okay thanks and then jason and glenn maybe same question on the billion of leverage again that was the only other uptick that we saw in jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc deferrals and thats still very very very small obviously of roll rate but any color you can give around that jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp yeah ill take that one sure it was really driven by one credit that migrated in that produced an active deferral i would say offset by a couple others that came off and that one credit were really not overly concerned about we sit in a capital structure on a firstout basis with less than loan to value its in the leisure space just so you know and theres five times the amount of junior equity in debt behind us in that deal and in exchange for us providing a deferral the sponsor actually put in some equity laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great super helpful okay and then just wondered if maybe more broadly john just going back to where mark was going in terms of the ma question because again to this point your stock is exponentially outperformed here certainly even recently and so thats very very strong currency can you help us think more generally if you were to consider full bank ma whats the smallest deal that makes sense whats the largest deal that makes sense whats your sweet spot just how youre approaching that and i realized youve got a lot going on here in the next couple of quarters but just sort of thinking a little bit further out thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah i think laurie its hard for me to provide a detailed perspective there i think its consistent with what ive said before and what weve said is that its a pretty high bar for us from a financial perspective because we think weve got a lot of organic running room and we certainly dont want to kind of dilute that as we move forward webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 i would say if a transaction was really financially compelling obviously that would be one of the gating elements but more importantly for us its around strategy and youve the makeup of our earning streams shift more commercial over time and more wholesale over time and youve seen us try and aggressively grow hsa bank so kind of tuckin acquisitions that are basically branchbased are not particularly interesting to us so if something came along that enabled us to gain scale was financially compelling and was consistent with our strategic view of expanding our commercial banking capabilities and enhancing the value of our hsa franchise that would be something we would look at so i would say larger rather than smaller and not really focused on continuous branch acquisition laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks okay and then just chad one last question for you on hsa just looking at the just in terms of both your noninterest income just the sharp drop linkedquarter and then also just more broadly looking at your hsa efficiency ratio going from to can you help us think about that a little bit especially since your nii distribution charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank operating management committee webster financial corp yeah so laurie in my prepared comments i highlighted the hsa change quarteroverquarter there were million in gpa exit fees last quarter so thats primarily what youre seeing on the drop on noninterest income and obviously that impacts efficiency ratio as well laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got it so im sorry million last quarter charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank operating management committee webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc staying within that billion perfect okay great thank you so much john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah all right laurie thank you charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank operating management committee webster financial corp thank you operator thank you our next questions come from the line of steven duong with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc i apologize i jumped on a little late so im not sure if you guys covered this but on your margin just looking at your sensitivity if the yield curve steepens say that the 10year gets to by the end of the year how does that look for your nii going to glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp look i think if you look at our book half of it is tied to the short end of the curve so i think we have about billion in one month libor another billion at threemonth libor so thats the primary driver obviously our resi book and our investment portfolio are tied to the longer end of the curve but that will take a while to cycle through steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it glenn and just the front end you bought this through the floors is that correct indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so we have about billion of floors right now and theyre in the money about to basis points steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it all right glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thats primarily in commercial theres little amount in home equity and smaller amount in business banking steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and then just if the growth environment if its a little slow this year on loans you guys are accumulating a decent amount of capital how are you guys thinking about buybacks and valuation levels that are attractive to you guys and considering that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah i think from a full capital management perspective weve talked about obviously we feel like well maintain the dividend as we go forward just in terms of growing our earnings back into the to payout ratio we had started as you know in the first quarter of to start buying back shares and the pandemic hit and obviously like most of our peers decided it wasnt prudent until we had full clarity to continue that we feel like were approaching that point sometime in the first quarter early second quarter and so we do have approved authority and we expect to look more aggressively at stock repurchase depending on where the stock price is and what the market looks like beginning over the next several months steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you and then just the last one from me if the corporate tax rate gets to what would that do to your effective tax rate glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so that is something that weve been talking about and obviously tax strategy is something that were continually focused on but i dont have a number for you on this call but it is something that were looking at steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right appreciate it thanks glenn glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp youre welcome steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc and terry good luck on the new chapter it was a pleasure working with you terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp thanks steve operator thank you our next questions comes from the line of william wallace with raymond james please proceed with your questions william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks for taking my call guys im just curious if you look at your commercial loan pipelines starting to build are you seeing any variations in demand geographically that that stands out to you webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah its actually a great question and weve been trying to look through all of that i think in some ways its really obvious there are some geographic issues with respect to where areas have been opened and where they havent been theres some difference commercial in particular obviously consumers kind of rolling in the non metro suburban areas metro is a little bit more challenged but i think at the end of the day more than geography bill is sector and so we continue to see the biggest disparity in loan demand across sectors and that obviously seems pretty obvious those that have been significantly impacted either dont have the credit worthiness or the ability to take on more capital those in the middle who have been slightly impacted are being more conservative in terms of doing things forward that would create the need for more loan capital and then of course as i mentioned earlier we have some sectors that are growing quite nicely technology technology infrastructure healthcare in some of those subsectors we play and we have expertise were literally seeing an unsurpassed demand so i would say its really sectordriven more than geographic william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay fair enough appreciate that color and then a followup on the expense reduction target that to target from i believe it was the third quarter operating run rate are you anticipating does that include inflationary pressures colas et cetera that we see in the beginning of every year john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp it does its a net number william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc great john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp its a net number so youll see even in that walk we said investments in businesses it counts merit increases we expect to lower that on a real dollar basis william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc right okay good and then also as you look at the forgiveness of the ppp loans whats your kind of expectation of timing of that and ultimate level based on what you know now glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so we have about billion at yearend maybe just a little under that and i would probably say about in the first quarter in the second quarter and then and if you just think of it coming out that way and that can change but thats how were forecasting right now webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you and i will just echo everyone elses sentiment and say thank you for all the help over the years terry its been great working with you and good luck in your retirement thanks guys terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp thank you very much wally thanks operator thank you our next questions come from the line of bernard horn with polaris capital management please proceed with your questions bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc good morning i also joined a little bit late so if my questions are redundant please move on and i can follow up offline but first terry thanks for your really highly professional stewardship of the investor relations functions from the very early days of webster as a public company so weve enjoyed it terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp thank you bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc and thank you for all your work two questions the first is on capital and i dont think this is a big deal but some of the big banks have been concerned that the overwhelming amount of stimulus money showing up in bank balance sheets is pushing assets to a level where they may have capital problems i know youve managed the balance sheet down a little bit but are there any issues that you can see that moving forward if you do get a lot more money any deposit strategies capital strategies that might affect your management of the bank and the second well i can probably you should answer ask that question glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp so let me get that one so i think we have the opportunity to pay down on a shortterm basis probably about billion more in shortterm borrowings but we are getting near the bottom of that and i think what youre highlighting is depending on stimulus and the eventual impact through municipalities and things like that we could be i think the industrys bernie seem to have a lot more excess capital our loan to deposit ratio is as of quarter end it is something were looking at as far as the deployment if we dont get the loan growth do we buy floating rate securities or do we park the money in the fed so those are conversations bernie that were having pretty much on a daily basis and just monitoring it bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 thanks and the second question is just really about were all trying to guess which way the postcovid world goes certainly youve been a beneficiary i think of the move to suburban and resi but on the commercial side are you seeing any early warning signs that you might be cautious about with respect to the deployment of commercial real estate office buildings and so forth and whether you see any potential problems there just im sure you get the gist of the question john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp yeah its actually a great question bernie and its nice to hear from you and ill let jason put a finer point on it i think weve got really good strong relationships in our investor cre group and i think everybody seems to be a little bit more thoughtful and careful particularly in metro market buildings were seeing even on outside of office on our multifamily were not big in new york metro which obviously benefits us here we are seeing i think a little bit of stabilization in boston and given where we underwrite and the quality of the sponsors were not seeing any cracks in multifamily i think in office weve been sort of spending i was getting like bill wrang mentioned on every earnings call but bill a while back really pivoted we had i think maybe of our of our property types were in office going back years ago and i think bill took a decided view at some of the paradigm shifts to move away from that so we dont have tons of metro office which is good and i think that like most people in the industry our sense now is were not really going to know for several more quarters what would happen because youve got obviously if you look at the real vacancy rates meaning people in the seats in those buildings in those offices in boston and new york and philadelphia where we have real estate exposure youre talking to of the people in their seats theres a lot of talk and ive seen in connecticut a lot of the big companies and the ceos ive talked to trying to drive an immediate reduction in their occupied office space coming out of the pandemic but we also feel and you also read a lot about people starting to really struggle working remotely and that particularly if you have dedensified office space you may have you may need the same square footage going forward so thats a long way from me of saying i think its too soon we are not seeing real problems yet i think it is too soon to see problems because you dont have lease renewals and i think its too soon to call what the future of work will mean to office occupancy but its something that were really focused on and we are taking your last question was i think were taking that into consideration as we look at new potential opportunities which would mean were going to be much more selective jason i probably stole all of your thunder is there anything jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp no its okay ill ask three quick sort of data points if you will to support everything you said which i think was spot on so weve got one active deferral in our office portfolio which is fairly large its spiked million so the portfolio has been performing very well weve not received a lot of deferrals and to your point about sort of maturity of leases weve got less than of the square footage in our lease portfolio our office portfolio coming due over the next couple of years so less than in less than in so i dont think theres a lot of nearterm pressure webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 and the last point ill make is that going into this and because we havent seen john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp jason i think we lost you were having technical problems today for the first time jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp can you hear me now bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc i can hear him fine john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp oh you can okay jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corp all right so the last point i would add is just going into this and we still view this as reasonably good until we get more information our loan to value on the entire portfolio is and debt service coverage over times so theres a fair amount of cushion even if you see pressure on rental rates or occupancy postcovid john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks jason bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc great thats really as always very good color and thanks for the great conservative way that youve addressed that market up to this point thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks bernie have a stay healthy and safe operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to hand the call back over to john ciulla for closing comments john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer memberoperating management committee webster financial corp thanks daryl i
