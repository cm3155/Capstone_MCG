successfully adapted to the pandemicdriven environment and its many challenges this has enabled them to effectively meet customer needs successfully introduce alwayschecking our new free digital identity protection service and further advance strategic initiatives very proud of the dedication our employees have displayed and the creative ways that they have supported customers and each other during these uncertain times this is a reflection of the deeply ingrained culture peoples united has which has been built over many years and differentiates the company in the markets we serve lets begin by turning to slide we are pleased with our third quarter financial and operating performance which is the result of strong execution across the franchise operating earnings of million increased linked quarter and from a year ago on a per common share basis operating earnings were up from the previous quarter and in line with the prior year these results benefited from solid fee income wellmaintained expenses reduced provision linked quarter and lower effective tax rate partially offsetting these favorable items was net interest margin compression our continued thoughtful approach to expense management and the realization of projected cost savings from acquisitions drove a 300basispoint improvement yearoveryear in the third quarter efficiency ratio to we are particularly pleased that with our ability to successfully control cost and strengthen operating leverage has led to a significant enhancement in the efficiency ratio in recent years fullyear efficiency ratio has improved annually since when reported a ratio of by the ratio was down to and we expect this improving trend will continue in as the yeartodate efficiency ratio stands at importantly we remain focused on expense management and discipline and we are also steadfast in our commitment to investing strategically in the business such investments include further enhancing digital capabilities delivering innovative products and services and strengthening leadership and talent the third quarter was indicative of this commitment we announced the formation of our business transformation office in august this specialized team will lead the companys efforts related to digitization process automation and fintech relationships we are excited about the enhancements and efficiencies this team will deliver moving forward during the quarter our focus on expanding digital capabilities was evident in treasury management as we bolstered their suite of technology in partnership with multiple fintech firms we implemented integrated payables and invoicetopay solutions as well as an electronic billing and payment offering these additions deliver simple secure digital capabilities for commercial banking customers in july we introduced alwayschecking a premium digital identity protection service which we are providing free to all personal checking account customers this offering builds on our core value proposition of service and protection and we are confident that it will further attract and retain customers and in august we expanded the regional leadership team and our wealth management business peoples united advisors with the addition of senior executives in new york and massachusetts the addition of these two seasoned industry veterans will further benefit customer retention and drive profitable growth in their respective regions moving on to the balance sheet period end loans and deposits each declined linked quarter leaving the loan to deposit ratio unchanged at commercial period end loans grew million from june due to record mortgage warehouse balances and the solid growth by leaf within our equipment finance segment peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 conversely the retail period end loans decreased million mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we further remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios the modest decline in periodend deposits resulted from runoff of higher cost wholesale funding and lower municipal balances partially offset by strong commercial deposit growth it is evident the pandemic has significantly affected the economy demand within our commercial real estate and middle market ci businesses has been limited due to the reduced economic activity and funding provided by ppp loans lower demand is particularly demonstrated by ci line utilization rates which declined for the second consecutive quarter and are below their historical quarterly averages similar to the second quarter we did experienced some areas of growth in particular mortgage warehouse continues to benefit from robust origination activity in both the purchase and refinance segments as well as from solid growth in new customer relationships in addition leaf has continued to perform well primarily due to increased customer demand for technology hardware and software and this trend is attributable to the strong growth from a number of significant long standing vendor relationships with leaf and var technologies sic var technology which we acquired last year the total impact of the pandemic on the longterm economy is unknown however improvements in economic activity during the quarter provided us a level of cautious optimism as we look ahead another positive indicator was the significant reduction in the number of our customers needing relief as the total loan deferrals were approximately billion or of total loans at september down from more than billion or of total loans at the end of june additionally deferrals have continued to decline since the close of the third quarter these results are consistent with the expectations we provided on our second quarter earnings call we believe this improvement is a testament to our long held conservative underwriting approach and reflects the strong capital and liquidity profile of our customers the forbearance level at quarterend was comprised of almost billion of second deferrals and million of loans still in their first deferral period notably our relationship managers continue to maintain highlevel of contact with customers to closely evaluate their financial condition and help them navigate their specific situations as expected the largest concentration of second deferrals were in our billion hospitality portfolio which includes hotels total deferrals in this portfolio were approximately million at quarter end which includes million of second deferrals in comparison total deferrals at the close of the second quarter were million the hotel industry has been significantly impacted by the pandemic the severity of the impact varies by property influenced by many factors including hotel type primary customer base and location the challenges faced by this industry will likely extend into next year as such we expect to offer modifications to most of our hotel customers after their deferral period ends our strong relationship with these customers has facilitated ongoing conversations which provided granular views of their current operations and financial resources this has driven a constructive and collaborative process to determine appropriate terms to continue support importantly our hotel portfolio is well diversified particularly by geography of note only or approximately million of our hotel loans are collateralized by properties in new york city we have confidence that the strength and experience of our hotel owner operators in our originated portfolio should enable them to successfully emerge from the pandemic driven industry slowdown two other portfolios we have previously called out as significantly affected by the pandemic commercial retail and restaurants have peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 performed well and experienced a substantial decline in deferrals our billion cre retail portfolio has seen deferrals improve from billion at the end of the second quarter to million at the close of september as a reminder this portfolio does not have material exposure to enclose malls and essential tenants such as grocery stores pharmacies and big box home improvement locations comprise roughly half of the portfolio similarly deferrals in the restaurant portfolio which has approximately million of loan balances have declined from million at june to million at the end of the third quarter the portfolio is mostly in well known national quick service franchises which have established and experienced a lesser degree of disruption especially where drivethru traffic remained strong deferrals have continued to improve since the close of the quarter and notably our franchise finance business no longer has any deferrals in its restaurant book finally we announced the sale of peoples united insurance agency to assuredpartners for million in cash the transaction allows us to simplify our operating model and monetize the companys longterm investment in this business at an attractive multiple of times trailing 12month revenues it also enables us to focus additional resources on delivering core banking products and services and further enhance digital offerings which will generate superior returns for shareholders over time the transaction is projected to close in the fourth quarter subject to customary closing conditions and we expect to realize a pretax net gain of approximately million to million which will improve the cet ratio by basis points before turning the call over to david to discuss the third quarter in more detail i want to thank our colleagues at peoples united insurance agency for their meaningful contributions to peoples united over the years with that ill turn it to david r david rosato senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you jack i will begin on slide we are pleased with our strong third quarter financial performance which was highlighted by preprovision net revenue of million an increase of linked quarter and from a year ago on an operating basis ppnr million was down compared to the previous quarter due to a modest increase in expenses but marked an improvement of yearoveryear provision for credit losses on loans of million decreased million from the second quarter and further strengthened the allowance for credit losses to total loans by basis points to basis points or basis points excluding ppp loans the provision was comprised of million of net charge offs which were up million linkedquarter and an increase of million in the allowance for credit losses down from an increase of million in the second quarter as you can see on slide we break down the allowance for credit losses by loan portfolio segment the total allowance at september of nearly million up from million at the end of the second quarter provide significant coverage as it represents more than times our annualized third quarter net charge offs at of nonperforming loans the allowance at quarterend reflects consideration of a baseline economic forecast as well as a more adverse scenario each prepared as of late september the baseline scenario reflects modest improvement in most key economic variables compared to the baseline scenario employed at the end of the second quarter the more adverse scenario includes continued uncertainty associated with the status and extent of further economic stimulus and the upcoming election the cumulative yeartodate allowance build is approximately million which increased the allowance to total loans ratio by basis points since yearend or basis point excluding ppp balances peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 moving to slide net interest income of million decreased million or from the second quarter primarily due to a smaller average balance sheet and lower margin the loan portfolio unfavorably impacted net interest income by million in addition lower average balances in the securities portfolio reduced net interest income by million these headwinds were partially offset by lower deposit costs and an additional calendar day in the third quarter which benefited net interest income by million and million respectively a reduction in borrowings also favorably impacted net interest income by million as average balances decreased billion from the second quarter yeartodate we have reduced borrowings nearly billion on a period end basis as a result of billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year of note net interest income benefited million from ppp during the quarter which reflects million in related fees and million in net interest income as displayed on slide net interest margin of was basis points lower than the second quarter the loan portfolio unfavorably impacted the margin by basis points primarily driven by new business yields remaining lower than the total portfolio yield and downward repricing in the floating rate loans the largest offset to this negative effect was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing which benefited the margin by basis points average deposit costs were basis points in the third quarter compared to basis points in the second quarter marking the fifth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs in addition one more calendar day in the third quarter and reduced borrowing benefited the margin by a collective basis points ppp had a basis point unfavorable impact on the margins in the third quarter as you will recall the impact in the second quarter was negligible as the loans were not on indiscernible for the full three months turning to loans on slide average balances were down million or from the second quarter while periodend loans decreased million or both average and periodend loans benefited from record mortgage warehouse balances and solid growth by lease mortgage warehouse periodend balances closed the quarter at billion up million from june as strong results continued to be driven by robust mortgage origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships lease average and periodend balances grew and respectively in the second quarter primarily driven by customer demand for technology hardware and software these favorable results were more than offset by lower retail balances and continued low loan demand in our commercial real estate and middle market ci businesses due to subdued economic activity and funding provided by ppp loans the million decrease in retail period end loans was mostly attributable to our planned reduction in residential mortgages which drove balances down million from the close of the second quarter balances in the transactional portion of the new york multifamily portfolio which is in runoff mode ended the quarter at million down million linkedquarter and million yeartodate in addition the periodend balance for the united loans we have chosen to run off was million a decline of million from june and million since yearend our expectation for each of these portfolios to run off between million to million for the full year is unchanged finally quarterend ppp balances of billion were up modestly from billion at june on an average basis ppp loans were billion up approximately million linkedquarter as these loans were not on the books for the full three months of q2 peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 moving on to deposits on slide average balances were up billion or from the second quarter while periodend balances declined million or the modest decline in periodend deposits resulted from the runoff of highercost wholesale funding and lower municipal balances partially offset by strong commercial deposit growth particularly in mortgage warehouse both average and periodend balances grew across all deposit categories with the exception of time average time balances decreased nearly billion from the second quarter while on a periodend basis balances were down more than billion the decrease in time deposits is a reflection of customer preference for liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate environment notably periodend noninterest bearing deposits increased for the sixth consecutive quarter balances were up million from the end of the second quarter to billion noninterest bearing deposits now account for more than of total periodend balances up from at yearend looking at slide noninterest income rebounded in the third quarter to million up million or from the second quarter and reflected improved results across most businesses the largest increase was bank service charges which grew million due to higher levels of customer activity commercial banking lending fees were up million primarily driven by increased ci loan prepayment fees higher investment management and cash management fees collectively benefited noninterest income by million insurance revenues increased while operating lease income grew in addition other noninterest income was up million the primary driver of the increase was million in higher gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans the largest offset to these increases was a million reduction in customer interest rate swap income which continues to be unfavorably impacted by subdued demand for commercial real estate loans on slide noninterest expense of million decreased million or linkedquarter the third quarter included million of nonoperating cost a reduction million compared to the second quarter and were in the following categories million in other noninterest expense million in professional and outside services in occupancy and equipment and in compensation and benefits excluding non operating cost noninterest expense of million increased million or compared to the previous quarter the modest increase was primarily attributable to million in higher other expenses in higher professional and outside service costs and in additional operating lease expenses the largest offset to these increases was in lower compensation and benefit briefly on slide you can clearly see the 300basis point improvement yearoveryear in the efficiency ratio as jack referenced earlier the efficiency ratio is a product of our ability to generate positive operating leverage and in particular realized projected cost savings from acquisitions we will remain very diligent in our management of expenses and continue to be focused on enhancing operational leverage as we move forward in the current low interest rate environment our asset quality remains excellent as displayed on slide nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and reo of basis points was up slightly from basis points in the second quarter but remains below our peer group and top50 banks net loan chargeoffs to average total loans of basis points were up basis points linkedquarter the increase was primarily driven by two accounts one represented a ci account which was experiencing difficulties prior to the pandemic and the other was an acquired cre loan peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 turning to slide the increase in operating earnings linkedquarter generated a significant improvement and returns for the third quarter operating return on average assets of basis points increase basis points from the second quarter while operating return on average tangible common equity of was up basis points finally on slide we remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management it is again important to note adjusting for ppp loans the pro forma tier leverage ratio at quarter end is for the holding company compared to and for the bank compared to additionally the tce ratio excluding ppp is approximately versus the reported this concludes our prepared remarks well be happy to answer any questions you may have operator were ready for questions question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen we are ready to open the lines up for your questions operator instructions your first question comes from mark fitzgibbon from piper sandler your line is now open john laviola q analyst piper sandler co good evening everyone its actually john laviola on for mark i hope everyone is well r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey john r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey john john laviola q analyst piper sandler co i was wondering if we could just start on the expense outlook obviously youve been able to drive your efficiency ratio down over the past couple of quarters so where do you think this can go over the next couple of years do you have a target r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc we dont have a target that were going to share publicly for the next couple of years what i would say is both jack and i talked about it in the prepared remarks weve been highly focused for many years at this point on operational improvements and decrease in the efficiency ratio and we think we have a very strong record that we also think we will be able to continue to work down from here peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 in this environment its tougher to do as you know but at this point in the year we wont be sharing any targets come january but were talking about yearend we hope to be back into the business of providing targets and guidance john laviola q analyst piper sandler co okay i appreciate the color there maybe just switching over to the margin i know there are a lot of moving parts at year end could you maybe share your outlook for that for the remainder of the year and maybe into r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc again i would go back to a question on the last quarter call about the margin from a longterm perspective so it really wasnt the back half of or but just if we stayed in this interest rate environment for an extremely extended period of time what we shared was we could conceive of the margin going down to ph to i wouldnt back away from that outlook but again thats not specific to any timeframe most notably just if we stay here for multiple multiple years i think that can happen what i would do is i would look at what weve been doing to protect the margin in this environment this year and i think weve had a pretty good track record yeartodate at being able to move deposit cost down being able to maintain yields in our securities portfolio and then to offset as much as possible the floating rate loans that are on the balance sheet which is about of that book i would also add that as we call out in the script about nice performance loan growth ph in our equipment finance businesses are great generators of shortterm fixed rate assets and the remixing of the balance sheet has been a real positive for us in the last couple of years protecting the margins john laviola q analyst piper sandler co thats very helpful i appreciate it and david correct me if im wrong i believe you mentioned that ppp balances did tick up a little bit quarteroverquarter was that primarily due to new customers or existing customers could you maybe provide a little bit of color on that r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure on an ending balance basis they were only up million on the round but on an average balance basis they were up million that was more jobs the volume that went on in the second quarter indiscernible was more backend loaded so we had a more modest average balance in q2 but we did do ppp loans right up until the end but frankly the volumes really trailed off as the program got extended john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc and we did we did make ppp loans to both existing customers and new customers as well john laviola q analyst piper sandler co peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 thats all i had thank you everybody john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken zerbe from morgan stanley your line is now open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks some of the banks that weve heard from this quarter have been adding lets say qualitative reserves based sort of above and beyond the moodys baseline just given the uncertainty over whether or not fiscal or federal stimulus actually gets passed can you just talk about like how you balance it where you are in terms of your reserve between the baseline and more adverse scenario and have you moved it more towards the adverse recently thanks r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yes hi ken yeah so this as you know baseline economic scenarios were more favorable in q3 than q2 and two parts two answers to your question so we did weigh a more adverse scenario more highly in q3 versus q2 to compensate in some respects to what youre alluding to we also each quarter have a qualitative overlays that are part of the cecl process and those reflect management judgments about lots of different things level of deferrals upgrades and downgrades in the loan portfolio as well as economic uncertainty and so we did increase qualitative overlays this quarter as well ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great and then just as a followup in terms of your higher cost borrowings obviously youve been paying off a lot or running off a lot of those how much more room do you have like what percentage or how much in terms of dollars are still sort of those less desirable higher cost funding indiscernible r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc good question ken what i would say id point you to kind of the remarks that we said we have really significantly been able about billion of wholesale borrowings came off yeartodate because we had a little over billion of deposit funding a couple of points because most of those borrowings were relatively short we were able we didnt really have a balance sheet that got ballooned right a little different than some of the peers that weve seen we were able to just as the deposits came in have the balances come off peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 if you look at the margin page in the press release youll see the drop in balances but what you also see is the cost in the quarter of the wholesale borrowing line has gone up a little bit thats kind of the remaining term debt thats outstanding its on a very low balance at this point but thats going to be with us and so theres fairly marginal room to bring that piece of our funding cost down where the real opportunity is is what weve been doing the last couple quarters which is the continued downward repricing of our cd book and getting more and more surgical on deposit costs across retail commercial and our municipal business ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dave rochester from compass point your line is now open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hey r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc just wanted to start with your expectations on the loan trends going forward definitely appreciate your update on the oneoff book and then the new york city multifamily book sounds like you did not change the outlook there at all but youve got your resi running down as well maybe million of clip the last couple of quarters so just curious what your outlook is from that portfolios perspective and then if you expect to see potentially ci start to bottom here and maybe grow a little bit going forward any thoughts on any of that would be great john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc was the first part on the multifamily loan r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 yeah just david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on resi on the resi piece coming down john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc oh sorry yeah and so we do expect that the resi portfolio will continue to go down modestly over time and obviously heavily dependent on pipelines have been very busy and then very active of late but how long that continues is uncertain right now regarding ci my take is that basically what i see with commercial customers in middle market businesses and consumers actually is a pretty cautious approach to kind of what the uncertainty thats out there from the pandemic and its showing itself in kind of a deleveraging and not any kind of push to expand or take on the next project so i think there is some caution right now generally out there in taking on the next new thing until people have a better sense of where things are going from the economy and their customers right so i think thats why our line utilization is down a little bit i think you see it in some of the national consumer reports about general demand so i dont know if you need to get to a point where we have a vaccine but it definitely has to turn a corner in terms of a more comfort with how things are going economically and from a health perspective david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then i guess just on the resi piece is there a target you have in mind for concentration where its of loans now and maybe if i could ask that question about the warehouse as well you had some great growth there its as large as its been can you hold this here with market share gains do you expect a little bit of a downtick there potentially as we go into the slower months and what your targets are for that piece as well john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah so dave on the residential mortgage if youll recall the belmont the farmington transaction those banks had over of their loan books where in residential first mortgages so we had almost of the loan book post those acquisitions in residential mortgages not quite as united concentration was more like ours as you just referenced were down to about right now thats getting in the ballpark of where its been historically historically we call it to so as jack said i think well still see that portfolio come down modestly going forward but the pace of decline of billion or so each quarter should start to moderate which is what jack was saying on the mortgage warehouse ill just turn over to jeff jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yeah sure so if you think of the mortgage warehouse business its really grown due to three factors increased line utilization with our existing customers weve been providing incremental credit to our existing customers and weve had a lot of new customers particularly over the last three to six months and so as we sit here today i think its likely im not ready to say its at its peak but its getting pretty close if you think about how much further can rates go down to continue the refi market that weve been experiencing thats really what theyve been writing to some extent so i think a lot of it will depend on rates but line utilization is pretty high by historical standards and peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 so i wouldnt i dont think its going to go down dramatically between now and yearend but i think as you look out over the course of its likely to drift lower david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it okay and maybe just one last quick one on the margins i just noticed that the yield on the securities book was pretty stable quarteroverquarter around i know you bought some securities at quarterend i was just curious what the overall yield was on those purchases and then how youre thinking about managing the book going forward if youre going to allow it to potentially run off here a little bit if you have to reinvest at lower rates just curious what your thoughts are on that r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure dave what i would say is the reason that the portfolio yield has held up so well this year is mostly about the portfolio strategy and composition of the existing portfolio so as you remember we have a weve historically run a longer duration municipal bond portfolio so it had a very strong ph coop protection in it over the last couple years weve been moving our mortgage back holdings from mbs pass throughs to cmbs again to achieve ph coop protection its kind of a lesson learned from years ago and then in the mortgage backed space weve always only bought and year mortgage backs so our portfolio has held up because of the long duration and were not getting those bonds bought away from us for the most part but then secondly because we have very little premium in the pass throughs so were not suffering high levels of premium write off each quarter it was only up modestly for us just slightly over a million linked quarter youre right that buying bonds at these levels are dilutive to the portfolio yield our average purchases in the quarter were about we were able to achieve that because of the mix of munis relative to mortgage backs our strategy going forward and has been is to reinvest cash flows weve been doing that not each month but kind of periodically as rates as we get opportunities i think that well continue to do that and then probably in the next year well have more clarity come january but i think well see some modest growth in that portfolio as well what would drive that is more asset liability management right if you look in the appendix youve seen our assets activity move up because of all the deposits that are flowing into the bank so i think well offset a little bit of that liquidity in the securities portfolio over time david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks for the color appreciate it r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now open peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good afternoon john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a quick question on fee income it seems like you like most audio gap the activity levels were depressed in the second quarter anything that youre seeing unusual in terms of that hasnt rebounded yet or maybe expectations for back end of the year r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah the big driver has been interest rate swap income for us that business is really tied for the most part to new loan originations and then mostly commercial real estate loan volumes there is some amount because that book is so seasoned some amount of two way flow as loans come off but its really an origination business we had swap income of over million fourth quarter of first quarter of it was only a million this quarter so thats a very large change for us the million quarters were probably a little inflated but because they were record quarters and the million is quite a headwind right now but away from that one line item we really experienced pretty nice fee income and it was broad based it was in cash management it was in bank service charges it was in our investment management business as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and if i could ask one more a popular topic is obviously tax rates could you make some comments on whether you expect the same proportional change in your tax rate if we do get the biden plan that you saw on the way down after the election thanks r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc most likely we havent really spent a lot of time thinking about under the biden plan the impact and quantified it but its a pretty simple exercise once we know what the ultimate tax rates are but theres not anything really on the tax side of that i think would materially thats materially different now from when we benefited from the drop so it should be proportional with ph our expectation christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven duong from rbc capital your line is now open steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good afternoon guys i apologize ive got cut off before so this is a repeat question but just on the loan yields youre at what are you originating currently r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well so there is a differential between new business going on and the total portfolio yield thats approximately basis points call it to basis points so yeah a little over to is probably the aggregate yield in the quarter i would say loan spreads have held up nicely for us in the quarter but benchmark interest rates came down a bit as you know steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right and just historically are loan spreads in line with where you guys have had them or are they still a little stretched r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc no i would say loan spreads have improved especially in the third quarter part of that is i mean the bad news in that is were just not doing enough loans right the ones that we are doing were getting better spreads on and a call out to our commercial rms weve been able in this environment to embed floors in a larger portion of our loans than we lets say yearoveryear our ability is stronger now so thats helped a bit as well steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just on the liability side your cd book where do you think that could ultimately get down to as far as the costs go r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah thats a difficult question what i would say is the average cd books for most banks also included ph run about to months so you really in a year youve turned the thing over the issue is just going to be where youre pricing those roles we have very successfully this year each month each quarter been able to bring cd costs down theres more to go there but i said this last quarter its the move in lower deposit costs is getting more surgical than broad based at this point i mean were already down at basis points peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right i appreciate the color thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks just turning to i guess slide and this ties back to an earlier question on reserving and provisioning methodology because as we look at the reserve to npls for a couple of these categories cre ci kind of closing in on how should we think about how should we think about that because a number of your peers are well above that r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc true but were below almost every one of those peers in historical net chargeoffs and you can go back and look at that for over a decade and you will see that so they may be adequately reserved at those higher levels but we would say were adequately reserved at our levels brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc would you be comfortable letting those ratios go under r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc if our entire cecl process which means economic environment management judgment qualitative overlays et cetera warranted that yes brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and as far as the deferrals go the billion i appreciate the color in your prepared remarks what do you think is the end game there as the final deferrals kind of roll off between now and yearend do you get most of those back to performing and modify the rest with little breakage how does that how do you think that shakes out john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah so we are definitely feeling good about the conversations that we described in the prepared remarks with the customers and the circumstance around all the business including the hospitality pieces that are left the individual owner operators

llc got it okay appreciate the color john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew breese from stephens inc your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good evening r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi matt john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey just curious on the insurance agency sale whats the impact to goforward fees and expenses and as we think about the sale itself was that driven more from a capital management standpoint with the gain or was that more from a was that more done to optimize the pl and simplify r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so lets talk for a second about the eps impact its incredibly modest the revenue was about million a year it was profitable cost base was about million to million a year and so we ph saw very strong agency long term in nature a lot of longterm producers in the business and very well respected the industry has been going through a pretty aggressive consolidation for a number of years now and the valuation was very solid and was an opportunity for us as you suggested to realize on that longterm investment that weve made and to put that capital to work elsewhere and grow the business matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay and then just turning to the reserve and really the provision i mean from all the commentary it sounds like you feel really good about the where deferrals are and the conversation with the borrowers there is peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 it fair to assume that the reserve built at this point is largely over and that provisioning should reflect more reserve maintenance at this point john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc well its kind of get back to what david just described in terms of the components of cecl process and in order to kind of say that you have to be able to predict what the economic and the modeling is going to produce in the periods going forward and we certainly are not in a position to do that we have way too much uncertainty right now where those economic forecasts will come as we roll forward i think its still anybodys guess i mean we said we were cautiously optimistic by some of the progress i think we are cautiously optimistic but were not ready by any means to say that the pandemic is doesnt leave us with a tremendous amount of uncertainty across our businesses matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay and then i know we have a number of or a few different portfolios in runoff mode but just considering how much has changed in the slowdown in the environment and the economy could we see a change in the thought process around running those books often and maintain the earning assets that you have there r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc i would say no so weve been running off that new york multifamily portfolio for a couple of years now the transactional new york multifamily very good asset yields and or so thats why we havent sold it because were comfortable with it and we i cant see us changing our thought process around the united loans at this point there are loans from the getgo that were purchased that didnt fit our business model so its hard to think were going to wake up one day and say yeah we want to grow those types of portfolios matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood
