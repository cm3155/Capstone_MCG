morning the earnings release is also available at columbiabankcom i want to begin the call today by thanking our bankers who despite tremendous disruption to their professional and personal lives have joined together to support each other and serve our customers communities and shareholders as the covid19 pandemic has evolved indiscernible region entered into the pandemic earlier than other parts of the us with the first coronavirus death reported on february we developed a detailed pandemic plan many years ago and most recently tested it through a bankwide exercise in december of the phased plan and we began to execute against the first phase in early january since then weve continued to follow our plan proactively planning for additional escalation at predetermined trigger points early on our columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 bankers were in direct communication with our clients to understand their individual challenges and work through options to provide relief for their businesses and families were a community bank at heart and i believe that our bankers empathy compassion and support has and will continue to be our most valuable currency columbia bank is well positioned to handle the impact of covid19 and its ensuing market disruptions this is different from the great recession of and and that its not a financial crisis but a public health crisis with serious economic ramifications that are still evolving the strength of our balance sheet credit profile liquidity and capital position along with our proactive interest rate risk strategies and sensible expense management will serve us well as we weather the economic consequences of covid19 we started off the year with tremendous momentum and you can see the impact throughout our financial statement line items eps declined by on a linked quarter basis due to the related credit loss provision expense of million on a preprovision basis this was the fifth best quarter in our history in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter while net income and eps were significantly impacted by the cecl provision expense our bankers remained outwardly focused and produced strong loan and deposit growth during the quarter while reducing noninterest expenses absent the impact of covid19 it would have been an outstanding quarter on the call with me today are eric eid who until this past monday was our interim chief financial officer chris merrywell our chief operating officer and andy mcdonald our chief credit officer following in our prepared remarks well be happy to answer your questions let me remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release or website or sec filings at this point ill turn the call over to eric eric eid executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc thank you clint first quarter earnings of million and earnings per share of included a cecl day provision for credit losses of million after factoring out the significant provision expense quarterly pretax earnings were best first quarter on record pretax preprovision income was million and was million higher than the first quarter of net interest income for the first quarter was million a decrease of million on a linkedquarter basis and an increase of million from first quarter the linkedquarter decline in net interest income was due to lower loan income from the reduction in the interest rate environment one day less of earnings and an increase in interest paid on fhlb advances this was partially offset by million of interest income and discount accretion related to the early pay off of three securities the increase in shortterm funding cost was mostly due to a decline in average deposits although period end deposits increased during the quarter the operating nim of was down basis points on a linkedquarter basis primarily due to lower loan yields our cost to deposits continue to be industryleading at basis points down basis points on a linkedquarter basis total deposits ended the quarter at billion up million from yearend primarily due to an increase of million of public funds our typical seasonal pattern is for little to no deposit growth in the first quarter at march of our loan portfolio was fixed was at floors with another million or protected by our interest rate color the result of of our loan portfolio was protected from further rate declines our liquidity position continues to provide us balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs overall we have access columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 to billion of liquidity primarily through our billion investment portfolio of which billion are investment grade readily marketable and not pledged on any borrowing base additionally we have billion unused borrowing capacity with federal home loan bank and correspondent banks noninterest income of million was down from prior quarter principally due to decrease in deposit account and other fees partially offset by an increase in loan fees compared to first quarter noninterest income was down primarily due to lower deposit account fees and net securities gains offset by higher loan fees noninterest expense was million in the first quarter which was a decrease of million on a linkedquarter basis on a yearoveryear basis noninterest expense was actually down we anticipate our expense run rate to continue in the mid as we handle expenses associated with covid19 and continue to invest in our future our core noninterest expense ratio was for the quarter down from in the fourth quarter our expense ratio compares favorably to the reported in the first quarter of our effective tax rate for the quarter was which compares to on a linked quarter basis and for first quarter at this point id like to turn the call over to chris chris merrywell executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc thank you eric and good morning everyone to echo clints opening comments we have shifted the way that we work to serve the immediate and critical needs of our clients and communities while at the same time keeping our employees clients and communities safe our production and backoffice teams have been outstanding as they worked around the clock to assist clients with payment indiscernible and another relief programs including the sba paycheck protection program the teams had to pivot very quickly because the regulations have evolved and have been successful in guiding our clients to the process as a result we believe that columbia is positioned to participate in the paycheck protection program at levels that are far and excess of our relative market share first quarter saw solid loan and deposit growth in spite of the economic shutdown deposit rose by million during the quarter and the mix remained at business and consumer the increase was predominantly in public firms and on the retail side we experienced our typical deposit seasonality as retail clients withdrew funds pay down credit and other expenses and then build some backup towards the end of the quarter our cost of deposits of basis points continued to be lower than our peers reflecting the strength of our non interest bearing deposit base on the interest bearing side we immediately moved to reduce rates after the basis point bad interest rate dropped in march and deposit rates are back at levels last seen in we continue believe that our relationshipbased approach is a key differentiator and our clients rely on this as much as on the any deposit interest rate available in the market loan balances grew by million on an annualized increase of new loan production was million and increased line utilization was million during the quarter in line with the industrys first quarters increase in line utilization was predominantly in the ci revolving lines increasing from at yearend to at the end of the first quarter new loan production was mostly centered in cre or million and ci or million with approximately onethird in the real estate rental leasing sector followed by the construction healthcare hospitality and agricultural sectors this was similar to the first quarter of where production was centered in the same sectors as well as public administration columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 its worth noting that agriculture is now presented separately in our financial statements previously it was a component of ci loans agriculture new production for the quarter was million term loans comprised of the production whereas lines were of the total the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio mix is now at fixed floating and variable new loan production throughout the quarter was booked at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which is lower than the overall portfolio rate of as of quarterend the overall portfolio rate declined basis points during the quarter with ci down basis points and cre down basis points we are continuing to invest in the business as we have said in prior calls we expect improvements in our peertopeer and bankto bank money transfer capabilities online deposit account opening and back office to small business lending capabilities to go online later this year or in early now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thanks chris the increase in provision under cecl of million is primarily due to a deteriorating economic forecast resulting from the covid19 pandemic we use ihs markit for our economic forecasts and when compared to the estimate at the beginning of the year while you can imagine it has changed quite a bit in general our forecast anticipates an annualized reduction in gross domestic product in the second quarter approaching to relatively flat performance after that with the following quarter beginning to see a rebound therefore the change in the forecast accounted for about million of our provision and the rest was due to negative migration that occurred in the portfolio npas clicked up a bit to basis points however this was not related to covid19 impacts the increase was in nonaccrual loans represented by borrowers who had been under stress well before covid19 issues and related impacts came to fruition past due loans for the quarter were basis points and net chargeoffs annualized were also basis points for the quarter therefore your standard credit metrics for the quarter were very acceptable on the risk rating side loans rated watch or below increased to approximately million during the quarter we saw watch loans increase million going from million to million special mention loans increased million to million and substandard loans saw an increase of million and are now around million in total these changes increased our watch and below risk ratings from to of total loans many of these downgrades occurred in portfolios that we believe will be quickly impacted by covid19 measures clearly these are unprecedented times the rapidly changing environment we are operating in today has dramatically changed the banks assessment of credit risk as with the great recession we believe it is in the best interest of all of our stakeholders for us to get out in front of this by focusing on the industries we believe will be some of the first to exit at stress as such it is only prudent to acknowledge these risks and we believe that provision taken in the quarter and the assessment of risk ratings undertaken prior to quarter end demonstrate or resolve in doing so we have also granted requests for payment deferrals amounting to about billion in total loans through april we believe these deferrals are in the best interest of our stakeholders as we try to work our way through this pandemic most of the deferrals about or roughly million were granted to clients in our dental portfolio roughly million were for small businesses which accounted for another million from loan deferrals columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 with that i would now like to give you some color on the portfolios we believe will be some of the first to be impacted by the pandemic for columbia that includes hotels retail restaurants aviation and of course our dental and healthcare portfolios in aggregate these industries account for about billion in loans or roughly of our portfolio the largest portfolio impacted by covid19 is our dental portfolio im sure most of you are aware indiscernible directed dental practices to cease operation with the exception of emergency type procedures so effectively dental offices are closed and are not expected to reopen until sometime in may as of march we had million in dentalrelated loans representing approximately notes for an average note size of therefore its a very granular portfolio as i said today we have processed payment deferrals for approximately twothirds of this portfolio as such those will not be required to resume making payments until august of this year we believe the impact on this portfolio is truly transitory and by working with these clients we will be able to minimize the impact of covid19 on their business as well as the banks balance sheet we anticipate a large number of these clients will also participate in the paycheck protection program which will assist them with working capital needs as they reopen their businesses before i move on id like to share a few credit metrics starting with portfolio as of march approximately of the portfolio was indiscernible past dues were minimal at basis points i would also highlight that deferrals did not affect this number as deferrals are only granted to customers in good indiscernible so in another way they made their march payment we also had approximately million in nonaccrual dental loans however these loans were already nonaccruals prior to the covid19 outbreak so excluding the dental portfolio we have another billion or of our portfolio to discuss the next largest segment which we have identified is having a high risk relative to the economic disruption caused by covid19 is our retail portfolio we have approximately million in retail related exposure split between commercial real estate and commercial business loan this represents about of our loan portfolio the largest part of our retail exposure is comprised of commercial real estate loans with approximately million total its evenly split well im really struggling here between washington and oregon as you would expect centered in the portland and seattle msas the average loan size is the largest component is building materials and gardencentered types of businesses representing about next is auto vehicle and parts dealers at around followed by food and beverage stores at as well using that origination values the average loan to value for the portfolio was with of the portfolio having a loan to value less than based on origination we have stress tested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen in the great recession the average loan to value rises to with about of the properties having a loan to value less than on a stressed basis of the properties have a loan to value of less than for the entire retail portfolio is pass is loss is special mention and substandard weve also seen minimal reclass for repayment deferrals todate in this portfolio hotels is the next area i would like to address we have million in hotel loan representing about of our loan portfolio about is in major markets which would include the portland and seattle msa however we also have about of the portfolio or million of exposure out on the oregon coast columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 to give you an idea of the type of hotels we finance most have one of the following flag holiday inn best western marriott and radisson these would be good examples of the types of flags that properties we financed out in total flagged properties comprised of the portfolio the average loan size is million today we have granted deferral requests for about million similar to the retail commercial real estate loans we did some stress testing on this portfolio as well the average loantovalue for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is with of the portfolio having a loantovalue less than on a stressed basis about of the portfolio has a loantovalue less than with having a loantovalue less than nondental healthcare is about million in total approximately million is veterinary and another million are physician practices of varying kinds and we also have million of other healthcare providers such as chiropractors physical therapists and counseling services the average loan size is today of the portfolio has been upgraded with on watch and rated substandard we have granted a deferral requests for about million in total in this segment similar to the dental space we see this sector rebounding when the economy opens up as folks are once again able to see the orthopedists dermatologists optometrist and so on okay restaurants and food services we have approximately million in this portfolio with an average loan size of today is pass rated watch and the balance is substandard we have granted deferrals for about million in this portfolio today of pass rated of loss and is substandard the average credit had a debt service coverage of with a loan to value of on a stressed case scenario loan to value rises to the last portfolio im going to discuss is our aviation portfolio which comprise of both direct exposure to domestic airline carriers as well as entities that leads airplanes to airline carriers in total the portfolio is about million with about million being direct exposure to us domestic airline and the remaining million exposure to lessors of airplanes today essentially the entire portfolio is rated special mention with the exception of one credit rated substandard as you know during the week of april the domestic airline carriers began entering into formal agreements with the us treasury regarding the receipt of funds giving out with cares act we believe this government funding will help them recover from covid19 impacts along with the billions of dollars of capital raised in the past few weeks by many industry participants as for the lessor portfolio of the exposure is in asia in europe and in north america the rest is in south america and the middle east the majority of the portfolio consists of narrowbody aircraft with an average age of years we view these younger more fuel efficient aircrafts to be more in demand post the pandemic based on origination values our average loan to value for the lessor portfolio was however based on what we believe todays values are the loan to value is closer to okay ill now turn it back to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc thanks andy i want to take a moment to welcome aaron deer our new cfo to the columbia bank family many of you know aaron as he has covered financial institutions for nearly years aaron officially started on monday and we are delighted to have him on board aaron now gets to experience these calls from this side of the table we also announced our regular quarterly dividend of this quarters dividend will be paid on may to shareholders of record as of the close of business on may columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and eric are with me to answer your questions and now tamra will open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions on the phone we have a response from jeff rulis please go ahead jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co first question on the margin before i get to that the percent of floors i wanted to i went through pretty quick but i think you said of the portfolio was protected from rate moves which is fixed loans but could you walk through the percent of loans with floors and those that are at floors eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc yeah let me pull it up here so we have of fixed we have are at the floors and then we have the notional color million notional color that offset of our one month libor so when you add all of that up thats how you have come up with the jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay got you so the is the notional color is that roughly that indiscernible jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co so chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc one month libor columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co yeah so looking taking a step back on margin i guess the biggest risk that you all see is that loan yields security yields or sort of lack of ability to lower deposits given the already pretty low deposit level eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc probably maybe all of those to some extent i think in the short run with the ppp program were going to probably actually see yields increase over the next couple of quarters as loans are forgiven and we take that deferred fee income into spread longer run obviously for the loans that we carry on our balance sheet thats going to have an impact on our spread margins are going to continue to be under pressure forecasting right now is a little bit of a challenge were seeing dislocation between libor and fed funds and so were getting our arms around that but i think were going to see continued pressure on the nim for sure and clint do you want to add anything clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc well i think just looking at it as a slightly different way might help so between the fixed part of the portfolio roughly billion of floating rate loans that are at the floor already and then when we think about loans that wont reprice within the next year theres about billion of billion in the portfolio thats not going to face that repricing pressure i think eric mentioned the difficulty with nim and for modeling purposes it is a bunch of us have just originated loans with a coupon but looking at our core business dynamics you have a significant part of the loan book its not going to reprice part of our interest rate risk strategies that we put in place was purchasing securities the advance through much of last year that perform well in a down rate environment so i dont think that youre going to see us necessarily aggressively reinvesting into the securities book at this time well be opportunistic about that so i think that gives us some defense to asset mix thats the big unknown we dont know when the economy reopens how quickly things return to normal we had a tremendous amount of momentum through january and february in terms of our organic growth and we saw some asset mix shift on the balance sheet shifting a little more towards loantodeposits as the loantodeposit ratio picked up so those are kind of all the factors that were taking into account as we think about looking forward and as chris mentioned our deposit fund cost of deposits are near to historic lows but we still have some fine tuning that we can do in that space as well jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay and clint just another question on the capital side in terms of you had a high payout ratio going in that included the special safe to say that you would maybe table the special and maybe buybacks but and a focus on maintaining the regular any thoughts on the capital there clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc yeah we repurchased i guess right around  during the quarter under our 10b51 plan and wound that down in late march when we hit the million that we have allocated for that we dont have any intentions right now of doing buybacks and for the foreseeable future columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 in terms of the special dividend thats always been a tool that weve used to manage our capital ratios down we still have a pretty healthy tce ratio of but i think theres so much uncertainty out there that our primary focus is maintaining the regular dividend and then i think in that wed be content to let those capital ratios drift upward jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co got it and one quick last one the reserve level that you would include credit marks relative to that of loan stated would that be trued up eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc so we add back the discounts on the acquired portfolios is that the question jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co yeah eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc yeah i havent done that math i dont think andy has either i think hes been focused on jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co just the amount do you have the discount amount eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc yeah we can follow up with you after the call jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay all right thank you eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc thanks jeff operator thank you your next response is from gordon mcguire please go ahead gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc good morning columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning gordon gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc so clint youd mentioned januaryfebruary production being pretty record levels i was wondering if you could provide how those trended monthbymonth i guess how big was the drop off in march and what does the pipeline look like heading into the next quarter and i guess just your overall outlook for the rest of this year chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc gordon this is chris and i can tell you the drop off was pretty significant as we moved into the phase have been starting to be shut down and businesses being closed we tabled andy had a pretty extensive review of the dental portfolio so he said as an example is we have requests that we put on hold indiscernible done this standpoint of businesses being closed and things of that nature so i can get the actual figure monthby month but it was pretty significant for the last month we were on phase two to set a new first quarter record gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay so the pipeline is pretty muted id assume the outlook is probably more flattish from here chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc the pipeline if we still have a good pipeline there are some uncertainty around whats going to happen in the economy and people reopen theres some pent up demand for things well see if those materialize but thats going to depend on reopening how quick that happens and how quickly businesses are back to earning revenue where you probably youre probably directionally correct there its certainly going to be more difficult gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay and chris you discussed ppp a little bit in your prepared remarks but im not sure if i caught total balances do you have that and just how are you guys thinking about funding those balances so i guess with securities not really being reinvested can you fund a lot of that with deposits or are you going to look to outside sources chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc we have the ability to fund we will look at all available options to include the ability to align to put those to the federal government as one of the options as far as discussing totals for in the second quarter and we will provide guidance on that and ill prepare to discuss the totals but i will tell you that the team has been hard at work and lots of long hours night stays showing up at pm to hit pm east coast time reopening so things of that nature and as we said we feel that well do more than our aggregate share based on our size and i would tell you that the demand outstripped our expectations columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay i guess andy your quote in release talking about negative credit migration going into a deep dive on the impacted industries i guess that the deep dive was probably warranted by covid19 but im wondering how much of the negative migration that you referenced is specific to covid19 issues or maybe underlying issues that you might have seen but were identified as a result of the deep dive you took or are there any correlated beyond just general covid19 issues that you saw andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc the vast majority of the downgrades were as a result of i guess our dive into specific portfolios so you look at airlines at million that was all past rated theyve all moved to special mention thats all covid19 related theyre quite a bit the downgrades were in our hotel and retail areas and thats pretty much covid19 related were there credits in there that probably have underlying weaknesses sure i mean i can argue against that but i would say that because of our focus on those portfolios those downgrades so i do believe thats predominantly covid19 related gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay thank you ill step back thank you operator thank you your next response is from jon arfstrom please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks just good morning guys clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc andy anything new or notable on the ag portfolio andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc are you saying anything more notable jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah new or notable i mean i know were focused on these other areas but can you give us your assessment of exact performing an ag at this point columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah i think the area that has been a struggle for us now a couple of years has been the agricultural portfolio and of course im sure youre all aware of commodity prices certainly the great news reports coming out of the midwest that farmers trying to indiscernible the ground and dairies going up on to the ground and so we are concerned about the ag portfolio were going to have to see how that plays out most of the truck came through the cycle okay some still have some product to offload but for the most part its really going to be a function of what we did in production in and then do we see any kind of a rebound in commodity prices by the time we bring the crop to market absent that the one portfolio thats not going to have the ability to enjoy such a calendar or timeframe was our cattle book which is about million in exposure and we are also watching that very closely jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good that helps and then the dental deferrals i think i caught what you were saying but it sounds like youre most of these loans would come off their deferrals in august is that did i catch that right in your prepared comments andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc correct so our standard deferral programs were four months and that was on purpose to take us into the latter part if you will or at least the middle part of the summer to give those offices time to adjust to the reopening of the economy get some revenue under their belt before they would have to start making payments for us so again we think thats the prudent thing to do both for the dental practice and for ourselves jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then just maybe a subtle question here more on the pl but what are you seeing on the card revenue trends are you seeing im assuming you saw a drop and it looks like its down a little bit yearoveryear and certainly sequentially but are you seeing stabilization there or changes in activity churns chris merrywell a executive vice president chief operating officer columbia banking system inc yeah jon i think that there certainly has been a resi drop i think youll start to see as you said some stabilization based on it will shift so from in person purchases to more online purchases things of that nature were also looking and expecting some pentup demand as things start to become reopened that people will get back out there and while spend money but certain parts of the industry through this process has continued to do very well and those of course for people who are using their cards so lets say its fair to stable jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks a lot operator thank you your next response if from jacque bohlen please go ahead columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc hello jacque jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc andy i hi andy i apologize if you mentioned this already in your prepared remarks and i just missed it but the migration from the ag portfolio that went on to nonaccrual in the quarter what sector is that from andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc its primarily from the fishing industry in the state of alaska so last fishing season was primarily what they call the indiscernible which is a lower quality water that goes as they say slam it in the can they delayed the opening of that and so the quality of the fish was less and so we had a couple of fish processors that as a result they have lower quality fish which attracts the lower quality price and that puts stress on their business jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and is that what they charge off in the quarter related to andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc no the charge off was related to a row crop operation in eastern washington jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i would guess that even though it was a little bit elevated in both these metrics in the quarter or its just kind of normal course of business andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah we had one chargeoff of million which really drove the charge offs for the quarter it was an extraordinary situation with this row crop farmer and i would not characterize it as normal business strain jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay indiscernible columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so much more a micro issue than a macro issue andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yes jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then also i wanted to talk a little about the press release noted some efficiency initiatives that where ongoing and i know that you give a range of where you anticipate expenses to be in just in light of investments and covid19 related costs but maybe just a little bit of color on what kind of initiatives youre looking at right now from an efficiency standpoint eric eid a executive vp chief digital technology officer columbia banking system inc well with regards to the digital were essentially done with our oversized digital spend at this juncture jacque and this has become part of our run rate that being said we are going to continue to invest in innovative solutions keep us competitive and remain relevant with our clients but some of the things that are coming as well weve got the small business lending platform coming and the new account opening fund there they are tracking and but were just offsetting i mean its just part of our run rate right now jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc ill add some of the other things that weve done its the combination of the things weve been doing over the past few years and starting to get higher adoption rates theres obviously some of that has accelerated with people learning how to conduct business differently and through digital channels but also its some of the things that are have always been ongoing and thats what eric was getting at its part of our dna is looking for how we can do something better id say in the last six months weve taken a look at functionally how were aligned and weve been able to eliminate and reduce some redundancy and that has some efficiency or some improvement in terms of our noninterest expense run rate there are still some of the things that weve learned actually as we went through the paycheck protection program project there are some other areas as we talk with our bankers they say theyve learned how they can do things more efficiently thats the silver lining in this cloud that were under now with covid19 is that people are finding different ways and when we come out the other side i think were going to leverage some of the spend that weve had focus that weve had as well as some new opportunities that we have uncovered through this so thats kind of a high level 90000foot overview of the types of things that weve been working on and well continue to work on columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 andrew l mcdonald a executive vice president and chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah ill provide some color on that too jacque just with regards to the ppp program we digitized the whole process from the loan application all the way through fulfillment and we use the existing capabilities that we have and we did it rapidly and there are some work we would have been able to keep up with the demand and we tend to funding requirement without having all hands on deck and that digital that one really helped us good to saw with finish line jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and understanding that youre not going to provide guidance as to the number of loans or the dollar value when you did the ppp program was that open to existing customers or was it existing and some potential new relationships clint e stein a president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc jacque we chose to follow the process to work with existing clients and not use it as an opportunity to prospect property demand and the most important thing we can do is take care of our clients throughout this process jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you all very much operator thank you there are no further questions in the queue at this time clint e stein president chief executive officer and director columbia banking system inc all right
