inc thank you liz and good morning to everyone i am delighted to join you for my first earnings call as the citi ceo mark and i have a lot to cover today so lets get cracking earlier today we announced our earnings for the first quarter as well as the initial strategic actions were taking in our global consumer bank to focus on our competitive advantages and to improve our returns to our shareholders ill start with some observations therefore on the first quarter and then ill update you on the ongoing work on our strategy its been a much betterthanexpected start of the year and we are optimistic about the recovery ahead of us and were positioning the bank for a period of sustained growth for the quarter we reported earnings of per share on net income of billion this was a record quarter in net income driven by good performance in our institutional business and a release of billion from our allowance for credit losses as a result of the improving economic outlook in the institutional clients group our market businesses benefited yet again from an active environment we saw solid performance in fixed income after a very strong first quarter last year and a record quarter in equities we also had a record quarter in investment banking reflecting high levels of activity in equity underwriting treasury and trade solutions which are the backbone of our global network grew deposits even though revenues continued to be impacted by low interest rates global consumer banking revenues were down quarteroverquarter as a result of the pandemic however we clearly see a recovery taking root in asia as well as the us and that was reflected in our acl release and id note this is the healthiest we have seen the consumer emerge from a crisis in recent history driven in large part by the us government stimulus package citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 now while loan demand was down we did see strong growth in wealth management and in digital engagement both of which are central to the consumer franchise we are building and our capital levels remained strong and stable allowing us to respond to the needs of our clients and to return capital to our shareholders at our common equity tier ratio was unchanged from the fourth quarter and we resumed the repurchase of common stock which we voluntarily paused at the onset of the pandemic our tangible book value increased to up from a year ago now turning to our strategy when we spoke in january i had pointed to four principles which were using to guide the refresh of our strategy first we said we will be clinical in assessing which businesses we can retain or secure leading market positions in next were going to be focused by directing resources to highreturning businesses and away from the others third were going to be connected so we ensure our businesses fit well together and that they generate synergies and last were going to be simpler to better serve our clients fulfill our obligations to our regulators and unlock value for our shareholders we also committed to take the strategic decisions needed to best position citi to win and to close the gap in returns with our competitors and we committed to share these decisions with you as we make them and thats what were doing again today now i spoke in january about our new focus on wealth we believe were very wellpositioned to capture strong growth and attractive returns in this business particularly in asia and the us today wealth at citi represents roughly billion in revenues with threequarters of trillion of client assets and theres many synergies with our market bcma and commercial banking franchises across our global network yesterday we announced the management team for citi global wealth and the work and investments are well underway on the business strategy and growth plans and today we announced our decision to focus our consumer banking franchise in asia and emea solely on four wealth centers namely singapore hong kong uae and london this positions us to capture the full spectrum of the wealth opportunity through these important hubs where we can serve onshore and offshore clients and in asia this will allow us to continue operating our leading consumer businesses in singapore and hong kong which are both scaled and very highreturning we will therefore pursue exit of our consumer businesses in the remaining markets in asia and emea now while these are excellent franchises we dont have the scale we need to compete and weve decided we simply arent the best owners of them over the longterm so consistent with the principles we outlined at the strategy refresh we believe our capital our investment dollars and other resources are better redeployed against higher returning opportunities elsewhere what does this mean this means that global consumer banking will consist of two scale franchises in the us and mexico and these four hubs serving million customers in total let me be very clear on one very important point citi will continue to invest behind and serve our institutional clients in these markets we have a highreturning and leading institutional franchise in asia and it is an absolutely central part of our success going forward and we see important opportunities to invest and gain share with our institutional clients regionwide citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 indeed i saw from my own experience in latin america how the institutional businesses in each market really benefited from the increased focus once we had exited our subscale consumer franchises and simplified the operating model in the region i fully expect the same will be true in asia and in the meantime the comprehensive work on our strategy refresh continues we will continue to share the decisions we make with you as we work to close the gap in returns with our peers in parallel we are of course hard at work on our transformation were making our next submission to the occ this quarter its a massive body of work we continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and we expect to submit our complete plan to both regulators no later than the third quarter weve identified the ph end states performed the gap analyses and are currently working through the detailed resourcing and program plans and interdependencies and weve begun execution on several fronts the investments required go handinhand with our strategy of work so for example when we talk about simplification we are pursuing it through changes to our operating model but also by removing manual processes and controls and make no mistake about it we want to achieve nothing less than a fundamental transformation by delivering excellence in our risk and control environment in our operations and in our service to clients so i am excited about the road ahead and i have no doubt that these investments and others that were going to make in talent and technology are going to help us modernize the bank and position citi to win and finally i want to update you on some of the commitments were making in terms of esg now weve prided ourselves in being a leader in many dimensions of esg over the years i see it as embedded in what we offer to our clients and the communities we serve around the world and as you may know on my first day as ceo in the beginning of march i committed that citi would reach netzero greenhouse gas emissions by and we will deliver our plan on how we will do so within the next months critical to helping our clients transition to a lowcarbon economy is the support we provide them through our environmental finance activities so to that end were going to extend our current environmental finance target from billion by to billion by and in addition we finance other activities in support of the uns sustainable development goals outside of environmental finance and these include our important investments in affordable housing in healthcare and workforce development we are committing an additional billion to these activities by making our total sustainable development goal commitment trillion by and with that i am going to turn over to mark and then we will both be delighted to take your questions mark mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you jane and good morning everyone let me briefly review the results for the quarter and then ill go into more detail on the strategic refresh and specific actions we announced earlier today overall we had a strongerthanexpected start to the year driven by a constructive capital markets backdrop as well as a benefit from the cost of credit for the quarter for the quarter citigroup reported net income of billion revenues declined from the prior year while we saw continued strength in investment banking and a solid markets performance it was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates along with lower card loans in consumer and the absence of the prior year markto market gains on loan hedges citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 expenses were up yearoveryear reflecting continued investments in our transformation including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment as well as other strategic investments partially offset by efficiency savings credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of billion more than offset by an acl release of billion driven primarily by an improvement in our macroeconomic outlook as well as lower loan balances eps was and rotce was just over in constant dollars endofperiod loans declined yearoveryear reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer deposits grew reflecting consistent client engagement with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity before i go into more detail on each business on slide id like to cover the strategic refresh that jane discussed earlier last quarter we spoke about the significant opportunity wealth represents for citi going forward and announced the formation of citi global wealth in order to better connect assets and capabilities across the consumer and institutional franchises and to transform the way we serve clients across the wealth spectrum weve continued the buildout our citi global wealth this quarter and have provided some details on the scope of the business on the slide with additional information on key drivers in the appendix citi global wealth represented roughly billion in allocated annual revenues and it delivered growth in investment revenues last year driven by higher client activity and growth in client investment assets as we continue to integrate the component businesses into a single wealth platform we will finalize how best to implement this strategy from an organizational standpoint over the coming quarters and update you accordingly turning next to the actions we announced today given our strategic focus on global wealth management we announced the decision to focus our global consumer banking presence in asia and emea on four wealth centers as jane mentioned this strategic shift will allow us to simplify our operating model while directing investments and resources to the businesses where we have competitive advantages and the scale necessary to drive higher returns over the long run let me describe the markets where we will pursue an exit shown on the slide with added details in the appendix last year these businesses contributed roughly billion of revenues and while historically profitable like other consumer businesses the impact of cecl weighed on full year results given the pandemic with cost of credit nearly doubling in these markets yearoveryear total assets were billion as of the end of and the businesses are supported by roughly billion of allocated tce we have a good track record of reducing expenses in similar situations however as noted on the slide we are including fully allocated expenses to these markets which could differ somewhat from the ultimate expense reductions we will continue to manage these markets as part of the gcb franchise but we already have relevant actions well underway we plan to share more information with you as we make progress against these and other actions as part of our ongoing strategy refresh finally i want to emphasize a point that jane made earlier we will continue to serve icg clients including our commercial banking clients in all these markets and more broadly this strategic shift will allow us to focus more investments on icg in asia citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 turning now to each business slide shows the results for the institutional clients group we delivered a solid performance in the quarter driven by strong execution in the constructive operating environment for the quarter icg delivered ebit of billion up from last year revenues decreased reflecting the absence of marktomarket gains on loan hedges seen last year excluding this revenues were up with growth in banking and growth in markets and securities services expenses increased reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls along with other strategic investments higher compensation cost and volume driven growth credit costs were down considerably given a billion acl release the release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global gdp as well as modest improvements in portfolio credit quality as of quarter end our overall funded reserve ratio was including on the noninvestment grade portion total net credit losses were million and icg delivered a return on allocated capital slide shows revenues for the institutional clients group in more detail product revenues were up driven by record revenues in both equity underwriting and equity trading looking at these strong results across our overarching equities franchise we feel good about the strategic investments weve been making which enabled us to leverage our fullservice model to better monetize the current market on the banking side revenues increased treasury and trade solutions revenues were down in constant dollars as good client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues despite these headwinds we continue to see strength in our underlying business drivers including growth in average deposits in constant dollars this quarter and over the past year weve seen significant increases in digital adoption and penetration as well as growth in crossborder flows and growth in clearing volumes investment banking experienced its best quarter ever with revenues up driven by equity underwriting given our leading position in the spac market private bank revenues grew also its best quarter ever driven by higher lending volumes and managed investments revenues corporate lending revenues were also up reflecting the absence of prior year marks partially offset by lower volumes total markets and securities services revenues increased from last year fixed income revenues decreased reflecting a strong performance in rates and currencies last year however spread products revenues were up from the prior year as clients searched for yield in this low rate environment with steady demand across flow and structured products equities revenues were up versus last year driven by cash equities derivatives and prime finance reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions and finally in securities services revenues were up on a reported basis and roughly flat in constant dollars here we saw a good growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in deposits assets under custody and settlement volumes offset by lower spreads turning now to the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars on slide while we are still seeing the impact of the pandemic and high payment rates on revenues consumer spending continues to improve and credit remains healthy pointing to a recovery as we move through the year for the quarter gcb delivered ebit of billion up significantly from last year primarily driven by improved credit costs revenues declined as lower card balances and lower interest rates across all three regions were partially offset by continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management expenses decreased as efficiency savings and lower volumerelated costs were partially offset by investments citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 credit costs decreased significantly driven by an acl reserve release in all three regions and lower net credit losses the release this quarter primarily reflected lower volumes as well as improvements in the macro outlook and gcb delivered a return on allocated capital slide shows the results for north america consumer in more detail first quarter revenues were down from last year primarily driven by lower cards revenues branded cards revenues were down reflecting a decline in average loans as clients are using the liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt retail services revenues were down reflecting higher partner payments as well as lower average loans net interest revenues were down as average loans declined by on higher payment rates higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year reflecting the impact of lower forecasted losses and therefore higher income sharing looking more broadly on our cards businesses were continuing to see a recovery in sales activity in branded cards total purchase sales were unchanged yearoveryear but essential spend was up and we are starting to see the recovery in areas like travel and dining and in retail services purchase sales grew so purchase sales are improving slightly faster than our prior expectations and with the vaccine rollout this should support a further recovery in discretionary spend the bigger impact on loans is from the high payment rates this is creating revenue pressure but its also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends so the good news is that were seeing the recovery in spend which should continue and our credit portfolio is proving to be quite resilient we are now focused on loan and revenue recovery through driving spend activity reentering the market for new account acquisitions and investing in lending capabilities and new value propositions turning to retail banking revenues were down yearoveryear reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads that said we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships average deposits were up including growth in checking and aums were up were also continuing to broaden our digital capabilities to extend from deposits to wealth management to mortgage lending as jane mentioned were committed to the franchise and all of this gives us confidence in our ability to scale our us retail bank with a digitallyled clientcentric approach supported by light physical expansion in new markets over time on slide we show the results for international consumer banking in constant dollars in asia revenues declined yearoveryear in the first quarter we continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew with a increase in citigold clients and growth in net new money and the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four global wealth hubs average deposit growth remained strong at albeit at lower deposit spreads card revenues remained under pressure yearoveryear with purchase sales down and average loans down given a continued significant impact on travel in the region however we are seeing some signs of a recovery with the pickup in new card acquisitions and purchase sales yearoveryear in the month of march citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 turning to latin america total consumer revenues declined yearoveryear similar to other regions we saw good growth in deposits and assets under management in mexico this quarter with average balances up and aums up however deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continued to decline given the macro environment slide provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends in the us both ncl and delinquency rates remained favorable driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs given the delinquency trends were seeing today we do not expect credit deterioration in the us portfolio in and so peak losses may not occur until late depending on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit by contrast in both mexico and asia we saw a peak in credit losses in the first quarter of this was expected driven by the impact of customer accounts rolling off relief programs the impact was pronounced in mexico with a peak ncl rate of over as we saw most customers roll off the relief programs at the end of the third quarter of last year excluding those accounts that participated in relief programs our credit trends in both mexico and asia remain stable and you can see improvement this quarter in delinquency rates slide shows the results for corporateother revenues were roughly flat in dollar terms as the impact of lower rates was offset by the absence of marks versus the prior year as well as some episodic gains this quarter expenses were down as investments in infrastructure risk and controls were roughly offset by the allocation of certain cost to the businesses this change had no impact to ebit at the citi level and given it was immaterial we have not reflected the change retrospectively credit costs declined yearoveryear driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year finally the pretax loss was million this quarter looking ahead we would expect the quarterly pretax loss in the range of million for the remainder of although with some variation quartertoquarter slide shows our net interest revenue and margin trends in constant dollars total net interest revenue of billion this quarter declined billion yearoveryear reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances as well as the impact of one fewer day versus last year partially offset by slightly higher tradingrelated nir sequentially net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding the impact of two fewer days in the quarter was roughly flat to the fourth quarter and net interest margin declined five basis points reflecting lower net interest revenues partially offset by treasury actions and balance sheet optimization turning to noninterest revenues in the first quarter nonnir declined slightly to just over billion predominantly driven by the marktomarket on loan hedges offsetting strong investment banking revenues on slide we show our key capital metrics which as jane mentioned remained strong and stable again this quarter allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders our cet1 capital ratio remained as net income was roughly offset by buybacks and dividends along with the impact of oci and an increase in riskweighted assets during the quarter citi returned a total of billion to common shareholders in the form of billion in dividends and share repurchases of billion our supplementary leverage ratio was and our tangible book value per share grew by to driven by net income citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 before we move to qa let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for first our full year top line outlook has improved since last quarter at that time coming off the performance of we had expected industry wallets to return closer to the levels this year given the strong start to the year as well as the increasingly positive signs of a recovery ahead we now believe wallets will be somewhat higher relative to meanwhile our outlook for net interest revenues is unchanged and we continue to expect a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between billion to billion with stabilization continuing into the second quarter and an improvement in the back half taken together this suggests revenues down in the midsingledigit range better than our prior guidance for a midtohigh singledigit range decline second on the expense side we continue to expect full year expenses to increase in the range of to mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda in addition we could also see some episodic impact this year related to the market exits we are pursuing and as i mentioned earlier we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials finally on cost of credit we continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to credit performance and depending on the macroeconomic outlook we could see further reserve releases although given the size of the reserve release this quarter we would not expect to see the same magnitude of acl release going forward with that jane and i are happy to take any questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thank you jane i wanted to ask you a bit of a strategic question just for some more color on this idea that the investments youre making in the risk and controls will also help advance your goal of modernizing citis technology for the benefit of customers could you elaborate on that a little bit and maybe give us some examples of where youve seen technology gaps as youve done your listening tour across the company jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey thank you very much john so its fascinating at the moment i had a chance to go and talk to the ceos of banks who are our clients all around the world and all of us talk about the same thing which is theres a major transformation thats going on a digital transformation in the industry and so as we look at the consent order and the transformation the transformation were going through is much broader than just the consent orders although theyre obviously a very critical component of it and so as we look at the investments were making i look at the ones that were making in our infrastructure in our data as very much linked into a strategic need as well as whats being required and asked of us from the consent orders citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 so i gave you one of the examples just earlier but data would be an obvious example of this where investment that we make in the quality of our data will have a big impact for our shareholders in terms of driving revenues and improving our client experience in making faster decision making on risk or on business decisions as well as making sure that the data that we do have is properly governed and from a safety and soundness perspective so many of the investments weve got at the moment are really the strategy and transformation work coming together as it is for many banks john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then a quick followup on that for mark mark how should investors think about the multiyear cost of this transformation obviously youve given us some sense of whats embedded to get to your expense guidance for this year of up to but is this something that does get spread out over multiple years it doesnt sound like an easy or a quick project mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thanks john as jane has referenced it is and ive much referenced in the past it is a multiyear effort and weve been working very diligently on identifying the gaps that we have and identifying the root causes and as jane has mentioned were working very aggressively on constructing the plans to move towards more comprehensive execution but those plans have to come together and were still working through that and as youve mentioned ive been very clear as we develop the information as to what we can expect in the way of headwinds that to this year billion in the prior year and as we bring those plans together ill continue to share openly what our best estimates are for how the expenses continue to evolve what i would say john is that and i say this a lot i guess these are investments as jane mentioned there are benefits that we expect from them the data was a great example as to how we leverage that with our clients but also how getting that quality data in and not having to rework it and reconcile it et cetera et cetera saves us on the operating cost as well and i highlight that because as we make more investments we will undoubtedly continue to seek out productivity opportunities that move to offset those operator your next question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much i guess a simple one thats probably not so simple to answer is if theres not a huge revenue or earnings impacts from divesting the markets but there is a lot of like resources and bandwidth freed up i guess my question is what do you do with the capital just conceptual meaning everyone has been looking to you for a huge capital return story which you are but putting the consent order aside how do you think about using that capital offensively to augment the businesses that youre doubling down on mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure look i think this is one of the reasons why its so important that were doing a refresh that jane has described it allows us to be very clearly focused on the parts of the franchise where we think we have a significant competitive advantage and as jane has mentioned those are going to be the parts of the franchise citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 where we allocate more resources both in the way of expense dollars and investments but also in the way of capital allocation so that we can capture the growth that we see with client opportunities there and after that after kind of ensuring that were capturing those opportunities that deliver returns that are consistent with our objective of narrowing the gap to peers then we want to obviously return excess capital to shareholders as weve been doing so thats the way we think about it first lets lead with what is the strategy second lets make sure that strategy is rooted in growth opportunities and commensurate returns that make sense for us lets allocate capital there to take advantage of that and then whats left lets return it to shareholders jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes and i would just jump in on this one as well ive been on a great listening tour with our investors and hearing their perspectives and im very clear around our priorities which is closing the return gap with our peers making sure that we put a strategy in place that has the investment profile as well as the different actions to do so and as mark said this is our number one priority glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that id love to followup on just one piece so on that front wealth is definitely something that fits a highreturn profile you mentioned youre doubling down id love to discuss as a combined entity what metrics do you think well be looking at to determine success what are the important linkages with the other businesses that can be maximized better what systems and product platforms you need to add to get to these higher aspirations thanks jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc id better be careful because i could talk for hours on this one i think were incredibly wellpositioned in wealth mark gave you some of the visibility into the size and scale of the business today when i look at it weve got a phenomenal brand name an aspirational one in the wealth space particularly in asia but around the world we have our commercial bank which operates in different geographies around the world and is where a lot of the wealth is being created so we have relationships and are helping with the actual wealth generation and source of wealth from many of our clients as well as obviously in icg weve got a toptier institutional platform and capability and weve got our presence very wellestablished in these major wealth hubs around the world so i do feel were incredibly wellpositioned when we can bring these different assets and capabilities into a single platform so the investments that weve already begun making is putting a single wealth platform organization in place we made the announcement yesterday around the leadership youd have seen that weve started investing in growing our relationship managers and fas around the world and really bringing together the best of the firm and i expect as we work on the technology plan well have some different tech stack lined up against that too so jim odonnell putting the plans together right now but we see this as a tremendous opportunity and youll be able to measure us and hold us to account for this in terms of the returns that we generate the growth in the fee income and continuing to steadily capture share in the years ahead citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yes just a followup on glenns question so jane you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are now refocusing on consumer businesses where you have scale and thats the us and mexico and i guess were wondering im sure youre still in the middle of your strategic review what is your vision for the citi consumer franchise in the us and as we move past a world where hopefully your multiple is more reflective of your roe potential and youre past the consent order would you entertain inorganic opportunities for market share growth in the united states jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc erika great question and certainly what i have heard loud and clear from many of our investors as well as weve been talking with them look the us is our home market we have to get it right its a great franchise in terms of brand the client base that we have around the country we certainly see upside potential in wealth as weve been talking about we have a large cards business where the pandemic has accelerated the crosssell of our broader banking proposition and i think the broader theme of digitization we have very highquality clients in and out of footprint and theyve been very digitally engaged and thats only increased of the new accounts this quarter in the retail bank were acquired digitally and about of our clients for example are digitally engaged already and we have tremendous partnerships so i think weve got terrific assets and building blocks but as you said the work is going on right now on the strategy refresh and were looking forward to coming back to you in reasonably short order when weve done the work and have the plan on what actions we will take were looking longer run and for now partnerships are going to be very important but wed love to do inorganic moves if they make sense for our shareholders and for us further down the line but at the moment well focus on partnerships erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you for that and my second question is with mark is this probably partially how youve laid out guidance probably partially answers this question but investors seem to believe that there could be upside to revenue for banks whether its continued expansion of the wallets in your icg business or in more traditional nir sources and im wondering its a two part question one if we get better revenue from here could you still achieve the to expense target and as a followup on the expenses that would be carved out from those exits we heard from one of your peers that if you exclude overhead or expenses allocated to businesses exited we would see a sort of a net expense saves of about to of identified expenses and im wondering if thats the right ratio to think about those markets that youre exiting citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sure thank you so the first thing just in terms of revenue i did speak to this in the guidance and what i referenced was i talked about in the last quarter the normalization of the markets wallets and what were seeing just at the on start of this year and the strong start that jane referenced is that while i do expect therell be some normalization i would expect at this point that the market wallets will be above the levels and so we do think that that presents some upside i talked about the and thats what kind of feeds in part the down mid singledigit guidance that i gave for total revenues youre right with the steepening of the curve that does present some opportunities weve got dry powder to put liquidity to work and weve done some of that but we have more dry powder to do that with that said as i mentioned earlier we are seeing higher payment rates from the consumer business that offsets some of that potential upside and i did describe the nir in the way of a range down billion to billion and so that range gives you some sense for the ability or the opportunity if we were to capture more of that upside in terms of the expenses two things one you mentioned relative to revenues and the answer is that if wallets continue to perform even stronger or the recovery is even more significant on the lending side or consumer side or icg side for that matter then that will come with higher expenses transaction expenses compensation expenses but i think everyone would agree that that would be good cholesterol and so well see how that plays out obviously i did mention episodic costs associated with the exits what id say about that is and your point around allocations both jane and i have deep experience at this i have experience from citi holdings and both being part of that team and ultimately running citi holdings jane has run latin america both of those parts of the franchise historically have exited countries and we have both been keenly focused on ensuring that we get as much of the stranded cost associated with exits out of the organization in the past and you can rest assure that that would be the same type of focus we put to these exits so thats kind of the view there i dont have a ratio that id want to share at this point but please know that that will be a focal point for us in order to ensure that we get the most value out of this decision operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i know this is a tough question to answer but as we think about the timing of the consent orders should we think about the ones that came out in october of last year as essentially restarting the clock or since some of them were going on for several years and the fed and occ acknowledged that youve made progress maybe dont think about it as a resetting the clock and the reason im asking is if we look at other consent orders in the industry it tends to take several years three four five years and its a little bit trickier with you guys because again its not like youre starting from scratch but i was wondering if theres anything you could comment with respect to the timing and how i frame that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 yes sure why dont i start and then jane you may have some thoughts on it as well jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc what id say is look this is the consent order was clear in its way of directives in areas that we need to focus as jane has described were looking at this frankly a little bit broader were looking at this as a transformation and it will take it is a multiyear effort that is underway here yes there are some things that you heard us reference that we had started even before the order there were a number of remediation efforts that were underway in some of the areas that are referenced in the order were leveraging the work that we had started already but candidly whats different about this transformation versus a remediation is that were looking at this endtoend as opposed to a very narrow or silo or tactical approach to an issue thats identified and in order to do that you do have to pause for a second take a step back and look at things on the frontend of a process where things come into our systems and understand how you can improve those processes the technology that support them the governance around that i highlight that because your question is a tough question theres some of it that we will keep accelerating but we want to make sure that we do that in a broader context so that we get it right and thats whats really important to us jane anything you want to add to that jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think you said it very well mark remediation is tactical transformation is more strategic and much more fundamental and thats what were doing we take a soup to nuts approach were looking at the targets face we want to get to making sure that weve got real excellence in what we do and that is the focus matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so were looking forward rather than looking backwards matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just a followup there like isnt the reality that you need to kind of fix the regulatory issues so that you can accomplish some of the things that you want in the transformation right because i think your ability to do deals ability to open branches indiscernible a lot of restrictions so i think its good to hear about citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 like the longterm vision but you kind of need to get the house in order first right before you can accomplish some of those things or can you do both at the same time jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc you can you absolutely do both at the same time and thats what were very focused on as i say the transformation and the the work on the transformation the strategy in many ways go handinhand and are getting us to the same goal which is make sure were excellent for our investors for our clients as well as for our regulators and the safety and soundness agenda so the two go very much handinhand risk and controls are clearly important particularly in a digital world and we need them to be at a very high standard to operate as one of the worlds most significant financial institutions thats the intention as is the intention to make sure our operations are the same so one and the same goal here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc to your point jane exiting these countries that simplifies the organization right creating citi global wealth and bringing what was the private bank and our wealth organization and consumer together allows for us to come up with an investment platform a unified investment platform that simplifies the organization makes it easier to have controls in place around those processes so jane is exactly right the strategy is aligned with the transformation thats underway in many ways matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of saul martinez with ubs mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc good morning ive a bit of a hodgepodge of questions related to your strategic refresh so first you gave a lot of color on the financial metrics of the exit markets but do you also happen to have what the reserves are on the balance sheet that could be released over time in those countries second time horizon i know you indicated mark that youll give us more detail as it presents itself but just any sort of guidance on the time horizon are we looking at quarters or is this going to play out over a number of years just any guideposts and then i guess thirdly ill just finish up maybe more importantly banamex any how are you thinking about banamex in the context of your strategy refresh i mean it certainly is not a subscale business but mexico does citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 have some macro challenges as you guys have highlighted and a government that has very heterodox views policy views on a whole host of things so just any thoughts on how youre thinking about banamex right now mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc jane you want to start and then i can piggyback on that jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes so in terms of why dont we go start off with timing and mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah yeah and then ill take the reserve jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah i can chuck the reserve one over to you mark so in terms of timing look were already getting going and theres no dillydallying here what were looking at doing is weve begun the work the actions are underway in several markets well look to complete the exits in a timely fashion and we expect to be out in some markets this quarter equally this is were going to be thoughtful about who the buyers are and how we do this and the value that we create for shareholders in the process so while there is urgency on action were going to make sure that this is a good move for our shareholders and act appropriately and the timing is going to be driven by regulatory approvals in different geographies so as mark said as we know more well update you on the process but weve been very transparent about what were intending to do and then in terms of mexico look mexico is a scaled franchise when i compare mexico to our asian consumer franchises they really benefit from their scale the returns are good and theres a lot of upside potential there the investments in digitization have really paid off so while the country is going through a very challenging time at the moment theres a lot to like in the franchise over the longer term and i know well give you a better sense of the strategy there as we carry on the strategy refresh work but a lot to like mark do you want to cover the reserve yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so let me just i guess ill make a couple of comments and i dont think im going to get into a specific reserve number so apologies for that but what i will say is as you see what we shared on the page that its roughly breakeven in and we all recognize in there were significant reserves established in light of the pandemic what id say is if we look at which would have been a more normalized year the ebit associated with the markets would have been a little bit under billion or so and so it gives you some sense for how the build in reserves at least to some extent has impacted what the financials are that weve shared here citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 and again as we go through these transactions well be appropriately transparent with the impact that we see from them operator operator instructions your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jane jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc about what are you days in the job and you announced the asset disposition so i guess youre not wasting any time as you think about these asset dispositions or future dispositions how do you what lens do you use because you can consider returns you can consider growth you can consider synergies with the rest of the firm you could potentially consider regulatory benefits as it relates to consent order do you get credit for simplifying less systems to resolve or what other measures do you use i note that the it looks like the exit of the consumer markets those were capital hogs so i cant imagine the returns were very good but theres a lot of parameters you can look at what lens do you use jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so interesting question mike and frankly i look at it in terms of what we want to be not what we dont because what you dont want to be kind of falls out a bit pretty easily so the main consideration we have is how do we close the return gap with our peers and make sure that the businesses were in that can win and i said wed be very disciplined about going back to those principles i laid out at the very beginning and we talked about back in january weve been using this consistently in the strategy refresh work so the first thing were looking at is is this sector or is this client segment or is this business and does it have attractive dynamics as we look out over the medium and longterm and importantly within those dynamics can we win does this make can we be wellpositioned in this and i think were certainly seeing in the world of financial services today that scale is obviously a very important consideration so the corollary of that is if you dont have scale thats usually a disadvantage we look at it in terms of connectivity i think its very important that we have synergies across our major platforms and our client segments and youll hear us talking about that a lot more going forward and what are some of the metrics that we look at to demonstrate that were really capturing those synergies we look at fees and returns so therefore if its capital is it generating returns are we getting the growth were deficient on the fee revenues relative to what mark and i would like to be so that becomes a consideration and then does it really fit with the strategic identity that we have for citi and were working on as part of the refresh if its yes then this is a candidate for investment i mean laying out what the strategy is if its not its the opposite and dispositions were always going to take into consideration timing as i said in the last question citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 theres no fire sales here we are going to be thoughtful on how we ensure we generate value for shareholders on the exit at the potential value of partnerships with the potential buyers et cetera and how best can we monetize and generate value as we do this so in many ways its a little bit of all of the above on your list but we start in the opposite place if you know what i mean what are we going to be and then focus on making sure that we generate the greatest value from that and the other decisions kind of fall out of it pretty quickly and i think you can see that being demonstrated in the decisions we made on both why wealth and the hubs that were investing in in asia and emea but then equally the other decisions on the remaining markets on consumer being the exit mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one followup it is early but do you have a sense of what sort of return youd ultimately like to achieve and ultimately what is the identity that you would like to have for citigroup who is citigroup whats your jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc whats your elevator summary elevator jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup is fabulous mike then again when i go back to what have our investors been talking to me about the ph areas that as weve been going around and listening to them they want us to have they want us to close the gap of their returns with our peers i think marks given some indication i mean as we see a more normal when we see a normalized rate environment we get the strategy there a midtier range seems reasonable but i would certainly add and let us do the work because i want to make sure that we have a very thoughtful strategy and weve got clarity around it and when you ask us about what is citi going to be well be back to you with again a lot more precision and clarity around it but i think you can see from some of the moves that weve got we really want to be excellent and thats not just in terms of how we serve our clients many of whom are very have global needs and theres a lot of consistency around that but also i would say what citi is i want the word excellent to be one that is used about us in our operations in our culture in our accountability and in what we do and so thats the word youll hear from me a lot and thats the standard im holding myself and the firm to operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question just looking at the strategic actions that you guys had taken if i think back to right and what was outlined then jane was actually pretty similar in terms of the profitability profile of the businesses that you are exiting the capital benefits that were ultimately going to be reaped and it was at least difficult to see some of those benefits if i look at how the profitability profile has changed so i guess from your point of view having been at the firm when that was undertaken what lessons did you learn from that process and are there any differences in the approach that you might take this goaround to potentially drive maybe more conspicuous or clear benefits to the bottom line jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so sorry just in terms i just want to make sure im understanding the question youre asking in terms of the benefits of digitization steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc not only in digitization just if i think back to the exits there were strategic actions that you had pursued in exiting a handful of markets to try to optimize that global consumer footprint and it was very similar in terms of the disclosure around the exit markets were barely profitable there were capital benefits that were going to be reaped but ultimately we didnt see jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc those benefits at least translate into bottom line impacts and curious if you could just speak to some of the learnings from that experience and what approach you might take a bit differently jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc okay yeah when i look at the in latam the benefits we got were pretty tremendous so i think first of all we were able to very much focus on our strengths in our institutional franchise and we were able to make sure that we had truly worldclass talent we invested in our technology and platforms we were very focused on that client base of the multinationals we serve there in particular in the investor base engaged in latin america and we drove the returns up from teenagers to mid in a pretty short period of time we rose up the rankings in the banking side and really solidified our leadership on the institutional front id also say we simplified the management structure as well in the region and gained quite a lot of benefits from simplification that hit the bottom line as well so id say my experience has been one in which theres real benefit citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 from focus you get better at the businesses that youre in you get strong talent and youre able to bring more focused talent thats whats different and you get youre able to really get the linkages across the different businesses and hone in on them mark i dont think dont know if youve got anything else to add because you and i were both in these journeys together mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah jane i think you captured it well the only thing id emphasize in terms of kind of the whats different now as we go at this is are the last couple of points you made which is that keen focus on making sure that weve got the right talent in the right places as we go through this strategy refresh and ensuring that the org structure supports that again i go back to the wealth example and the resetting of that org structure you can point to the idea of moving commercial into icg to ensure that you got that focus against that strategy and you can really capture the linkages across the firm and then the last piece is the focused investment were moving away from kind of a spreading of the investments and really wanting to focus them on where we think the biggest growth opportunities are and where the highest returns are but i think you captured it all jane steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats great color thank you both for those insights and just for my followup i wanted to ask about the tts business its a really strong franchise and like the underlying balance growth historically has been quite strong and relatively steadyeddie in more recent quarters theres been some pressure it feels like a lot of thats actually nii or raterelated but i was hoping to get some perspective on what are some of the underlying trends that youre seeing in that business whats your outlook at least from here and now that most of the rate pressures at least should be fully absorbed or reflected in the run rate mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sure why dont i start and then jane you can add on as youd like in terms of some of the client perspective but look the revenues youre right were down about yearoveryear on an exfx basis and you hit it right on the head i mean the low rate environment that weve been in is a very big driver in what weve seen in the aggregate tts revenues now we have seen higher deposit volumes and that obviously plays through with that impact what i would say in terms of your broader question what we look at is one the engagement that we have with clients and we have very meaningful significant engagement with clients throughout the entire crisis that weve been managing through and that engagement kind of plays through and the increase in number of accounts digital accounts that weve opened for them really kind of reinforcing some of the investments that weve been making in onboarding and in enhancing our digital capability that engagement plays through in the clearing activity and crossborder transactions that weve seen which are both up and over the past months so good solid underlying drivers while we do see pressure on commercial card activity fee revenues excommercial card activity has been good and frankly as we see the economy recover and we look at some of the gdp forecast and that starts to play out citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 we would expect to see the business activity turn in a way that starts to play through the top line what we see again very very strong continued engagement with our clients and with how theyre evolving their own strategies and the last example id mention is many of our clients with the acceleration of digitization are focused on businesstoconsumer activity and thats an important area of growth and were part of that dialogue were part of creating that solution as it relates to their business model or business models jane i dont know if theres anything you want to add to that jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah youre going to hear quite a lot more about our tts business and the services platform it represents for so many of our clients around the world the client in my discussion with clients over the last few months they love our tts platform but more than that they depend upon it it is strategic for them and the different services the data it represents the other dimensions of it and so the growth that were going to see from this is next year is i think its going to be very material youll hear us also talk more about the commercial bank going forward as well because the midmarket clients and the born digital clients are ones who use our tts platform and the capabilities and services around it to also themselves start growing internationally and it becomes a core part of them so this is weve got more to grow with our existing clients weve got a lot of new clients that are coming on board this and this is going to be an exciting part of the story going forward and the underlying opportunities here separate to the rates environment operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hi good morning jane and mark i was wondering if i could ask you just about global recovery and pacing as you look through the supplement you see different growth rates whether you look at loans cards or deposits at different paces and as the currency translation impacts as well of course but just how would you help us understand as you look forward to revenue stabilization over time just how do you see the global customer base recovering in terms of pacing us nonus and if you can juxtapose that to an extent in the wholesale side that will be great as well thank you jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah ill kickoff a little bit more on the macro side mark will jump in on some of the other important dimensions for ourselves look its asynchronous growth out there is what were seeing i think that youre seeing the us and china certainly leading the recovery with asia europe is delayed but certainly not derailed and parts of the emerging markets are struggling so you do see a different picture in different parts of the world and as i think you heard from me at the beginning of the call were pretty optimistic about the us in particular over the next few years theres a lot of unspent savings out there with consumers huge amount of liquidity in the market corporate balance sheets are broadly healthy and then youve also got a lot of dynamism from digitization thats changing consumer behaviors and driving investment citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 so overall its certainly a very improved outlook around the world but it is an asynchronous one and were seeing as mark had talked about strong pipelines a lot of client engagement a lot of client activity but mark why dont i turn to you on how youre seeing some of this translate mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes let me make a i guess ill make a couple of comments one we are seeing continued pressure on our consumer business right so we talked about loan volumes being down particularly in branded cards almost or retail services average loans down what i would say is we are seeing signs of the recovery and while those loans are down payment rates remain high that helps from a cost of credit point of view and purchase sales are starting to show some good signs so branded cards purchase sales were flat yearover year the retail services purchase sales were up yearoveryear and the outlook is positive in terms of kind of gdp and unemployment and so the stimulus thats out there still has to play out in north america but we are optimistic that consumer spending trends look like theyre going to go favorable and that will undoubtedly help the forecast that i spoke to which is recovery in nir and some loan activity towards the back half of the year on the corporate icg side similarly were certainly seeing good signs as it relates to the markets activity weve talked about that and thats continued since last year but when i think about even icg loans weve seen loan activity in the private bank weve seen loan activity in parts of markets and so those are good and loan activity as relates to trade which are all good signs of the recovery that were all marching towards ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and one followup on card mark you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about how we knew that we would get the bounce in card losses but you mentioned generically that card losses would still remain pretty low any way of helping us kind of understand just how you expect card losses to traject overall mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah let me mention a couple of things on that so one is lets take it in pieces so latin america on the chart on slide big jump in the quarter almost of ncls but again that is a byproduct of customers coming off of the relief program in the third quarter and as we look at the delinquency buckets were not seeing meaningful signs of increases in those buckets and that gives us comfort in the case of latin america that weve reached the peak there similarly for other regions there are no signs in the delinquency bucket to suggest that were going to see big increases in our ncls and in fact in north america what you heard me say is that we likely would not see that until late in and so its the payment rates that were seeing its the lowactivity as it relates to the delinquency buckets its obviously the impact of stimulus playing through all of that that give us some comfort at this stage that were not likely to see a pop in ncl certainly in operator your next question is from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning so i have two questions maybe first on the corporate lending balances there were down yearonyear im just trying to get a sense of how much of that is driven by client demand versus overall risk appetite maybe its just trying to see if you get more risk appetite that those loan balances could come back sooner mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i mean look as you know were managing through this crisis but if you look back to early last year in the second quarter last year this was about ensuring that clients had an appropriate level of liquidity and that has continued to happen as you see in our deposit growth as youve heard others mention as you see monetary action there theyre our corporate clients have lots of liquidity by and large and they have a many of the clients we serve have the option of how they want to access the market for that liquidity and you saw that in some of the ecm dcm activity through the balance of last year and even some of it continuing so longwinded way of saying it is this is a clientdriven business this is about client demand and so its not a question of risk appetite risk appetite is always important we operate inside of our risk appetite framework always but the dynamic that youre seeing here is about client demand brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and second question on cards i heard your desire to grow new card accounts can you maybe just go into a little bit deeper on the strategy behind that is it more going back to promotional balances and opening up that buck again or how youre going to grow those new credit accounts thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah again the card dynamic here is about ensuring that we get the timing right as it relates to market reentry right and so obviously coming into this we wanted to be very thoughtful about how we managed our risk and we tightened risk criteria in order to ensure that we would manage responsibly through this pandemic and now as we sit here and see all the signs of recovery that youve heard us mention its about a responsible reopening right and ensuring that were targeting the customers that we want longer term the existing customers that were opening line availability to them where that makes sense in the case of our retail services that we are pursuing new account acquisitions both there as well as in branded cards so its about that reentry strategy and consistent with the target market customer that youve heard us describe before which tends to be of a higher quality operator your next question is from the line of chris kotowski with oppenheimer chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning and thank you my question is on the exit markets and in particular on the markets in the pacific rim are there operational linkages between the operations in all those countries that would make those citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 companies better to sell as a unit to one of the pannational companies or is it very modular and could be pulled apart in each country sold to the highest bidder and then secondly i was wondering also do the citibranded cards go with these dispositions or do you maintain that separately and continues to try to solicit and grow the card biz jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hey there chris so in terms of the exit markets id say its probably a tad early to speculate on the buyers these are fabulous franchises and weve got really tremendous talent tremendous capabilities there in the individual markets and so we expect to get a lot of interest but as to who and what im certainly not going to speculate yet when you ask about operational linkages i mean this is something as mark said he and i have gone through quite a few divestitures in different geographies and we are wellskilled and have to make sure that we can separate out the consumer franchises and then invest in the capabilities for the icg businesses its not been a problem in any of the divestitures that weve done which were many i think it was about or across latin america and others before so our teams are good at this its not going to be an issue and in fact it will enable us as we said to target our investments more into the institutional platforms and wealth in the hubs as we talked about and then in terms of branded cards do branded cards go as part of the sale yes its the very simple answer to that one chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc transaction services of course remains an important part of the franchises in these geographies and so our capabilities in commercial cards and our capabilities and payments et cetera for the gts side of the business remain intact and will be invested in operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jane good morning mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark can you share with us many of us are trying to take a look at what your bank and your peers will look like when we get back to some sort of normality were beyond the pandemic and one of the areas of focus is loan loss reserves since as you and your peers said you built them up dramatically now youre drawing them down of course can you share with us i think if i recall back on day one january when the new cecl rules came into place your loan loss reserve to loans was about and i think today its about can you give us some color of directionally do you think you could get there i know theres a lot of moving parts in change of mix of loans and different economic outlooks but the economy looks a heck a lot better in the next months than it did prepandemic and when you guys all did the dayone reserves and that was of course we didnt know the pandemic was coming back then of course mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah yeah its a really tough question to answer because theres so many moving pieces that come into play here so while we sit at as you pointed out the macro environment continues to improve this is based on an outlook and as those economic variables change whether it be us unemployment or gdp but also as our balances change so as we continue to reenter the market as i kind of suggested in my other response were going to start growing balances and were going to start and thats going to impact the mix of balances that we have and so all of those factors on top of in our case how the probability and severity of a downside continues to morph become important considerations in not only answering your question but also how we think about future reserve releases and so im not trying to dodge your question at all but it is a question that will be a kind of a byproduct of how we get to some sense of normalcy and how the portfolio continues to evolve gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it no i completely understood and then jane i may have missed this but i obviously since the excitement in your voice about the new refresh on the strategy how long if you have to sit back is this a three fiveyear project any idea of the how long it will take to get citi to the place where you wanted to go to jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thats an interesting question i mean what were looking at as we do the strategy refresh work is looking with a longterm perspective for the firm i dont think it takes us a long time to complete the strategy refresh work and well be looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we go along as we said and we get on with execution as soon as it makes sense so i dont honestly know as a former consultant as to whether youre ever done with strategy this world is highly dynamic its a fascinating world i think part of the excitement is im excited about the franchise im excited about the prospects of the firm im also realistic weve got quite a bit of work to do and were very mark and i are very clear on what our priorities are citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 so i dont think its going to take us very long to come back to everybody with a clearer view of where were going im looking forward to doing so and more than anything looking forward to getting with it and i dont think were ever done gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc i can assure you gerard that jane is moving all of us with a sense of urgency and thats the right focus that we should have on the strategy refresh but jane youre absolutely right strategy doesnt just stop right so well said operator your final question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jane hi mark thanks for taking my question jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc jane i wanted to get understand from you so youve gone through these exits as youve talked about in latin america and now youre doing in the consumer bank and that youve announced for asia now what do you see as the differences in your consumer franchise in asia versus latin america and pointedly the investment sales what is that as a percentage of revenue for instance in your asia consumer bank versus latin market thats a little second detail on that and will those revenues also go away so two different questions one a little higher level but tied to it is this whole investment sales and what do you see that and implications for your because what im trying to get is a sense of implications for your private banking revenues which i guess are different than this investment sales revenue that shows up in the consumer bank jane fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah and i think the differences between our asia consumer franchises and latin america latin america lets be clear is our franchise in citibanamex only today and thats a single geography with about market share and is a full offering to the consumer as opposed to our franchises in asia that were a bit smaller theyre excellent franchises as you know theyve got a good brand name theyve got terrific card franchises and an affluent client base but they havent had the same scale that we have in mexico so i do view them as rather different citigroup inc c corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2021 and in terms of what are the i guess the question youre asking is whats the ramification of the divestitures for our wealth business in asia if you look at the individual asian markets the domestic capital markets are not that welldeveloped and so the offshore markets in hong kong and singapore and indeed in the middle east and in the states and in london and the like become very important markets for the onshore wealth opportunity is usually massively dwarfed by the offshore wealth opportunity and thats where we feel were best placed to focus our attention and resources what i would also say though is one of the advantages for citi is were not just a investment sales proposition that we also do have the deposit franchise the card franchise we have the capital market platform for sure weve got the ability to offer our clients tremendous managed investments the content that were able to offer thanks to our icg franchise its really bestinclass i know its quite extraordinary in the asset allocation advice so this is really the capabilities we can provide the client is very well diversified from lending banking as well as the investment and the managed investment capital market revenues that you see so i dont just think of this as investment sales this is something that were able to offer thats much more broad in those world center hubs and the offshore is far greater than the onshore opportunity in those markets and youll get more guidance on this as we go forward as mark said as as jim fleshes out the strategy and the plan that we got so you can expect to get some more details operator there are no further questions i will turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks elizabeth lynn managing director headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank
