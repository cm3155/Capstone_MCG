conference over to the chairman and ceo chris gorman please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you for joining us for keycorps second quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call today are clark khayat our chief financial officer and mark midkiff our chief risk officer on slide you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and certain financial measures including nongaap measures these statements cover our presentation materials and comments as well as the question andanswer segment of our call i am now moving to slide before clark covers our quarterly earnings results i want to discuss our strategic priorities and cover the fundamental strengths of our businesses which continue to perform well despite the challenging operating environment in our consumer bank we are growing relationship households in an annualized rate of consistent with our investor day target our strongest growth continues to be in the west driven by younger clients we have also experienced strong growth in wealth management with doubledigit yearoveryear growth in asset management sales keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 in our commercial business we continue to add and expand relationships through our integrated commercial and investment bank our ability to distribute risk serves us well and importantly serves our clients well through all market conditions this quarter we raised billion of capital for our clients placing of the capital raised on our balance sheet this is down significantly from the we placed on our balance sheet last quarter although capital markets remain challenged our pipelines are solid on a yeartodate basis our ma revenue is up from the first half of we expect investment banking fees to be up in the second half of the year one common theme across our franchise is our longstanding strategic commitment to primacy having our clients primary operating account whether its an individual or a business our focus on primacy is reflected in the quality and diversity of our deposit base nearly of our deposits are from retail small business wealth and escrow accounts of our commercial balances are core operating accounts further of our total commercial deposits are from our relationship clients importantly these are longstanding relationships on average our retail clients have been clients of key for over years and on average our commercial clients for over years this quarter our periodend deposits increased by billion additionally weve seen continued growth in the month of july in the appendix of our presentation you can find additional detail regarding the quality and diversity of our deposit base we continue to proactively manage through volatility as it relates to the macroeconomic environment the interest rate cycle and potential regulatory changes impacting our industry going forward key will benefit from a welldefined net interest income opportunity over the next months as our shortterm swaps and treasuries reprice we will see a net interest income benefit that will reach approximately million on an annual basis by the first quarter of we also continue to be proactive from both a balance sheet optimization and capital allocation perspective were well positioned to build capital and reduce riskweighted assets we will continue to prioritize old relationships and exit nonrelationship business and nonstrategic assets in the second quarter our periodend loan balances declined by billion we will continue to benefit from our strong feebased businesses which make up over of our revenue as capital markets normalize we will utilize our differentiated platform driving fee income and naturally reducing our balance sheet on the capital front we will benefit as over of our aoci will roll down over the next months the next area i would like to discuss is our exposure to credit in the current environment credit losses remain relatively low across the industry but as we move through the business cycle asset quality will matter today more than half of our ci loans are investmentgrade and over of our consumer originations have a fico score of or greater these measures reflect the derisking of our portfolio over the past decade in concert with our underwritetodistribute model we have limited exposure to leverage lending office loans and other high risk categories b and c class office exposure in central business districts totaled million twothirds of our commercial real estate exposure is in multifamily including affordable housing which continues to be a significant unmet need in this country we also continue to benefit from insights gain from our thirdparty commercial real estate servicing business as we serviced over billion of ph office real estate exposure keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 finally we will continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency our results this quarter reflect the successful completion earlier this year of a companywide effort to improve efficiency actions completed in the first quarter represented over of our expense base and million in annualized benefit these efforts remain ongoing as we will identify new opportunities to improve both productivity and efficiency before turning the call over to clark i want to take a step back this quarter we strategically built capital managed the size of our balance sheet and for the third consecutive quarter built our allowance for credit losses as i covered earlier we will continue to take steps to manage our level of risk weighted assets in consideration of anticipated regulatory changes i will close by affirming my confidence in the longterm outlook for our business we have a durable relationshipbased business model that will continue to serve our clients our prospects and deliver value to our shareholders with that ill turn it over to clark to provide more details on the results for the quarter clark clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the second quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share down from the prior quarter and down from last year driven in part by two notable items our results included million of additional posttax provision expense in excess of net chargeoffs or per share as we continue to build our reserves we also incurred million of notable posttax expenses or per share this includes severance costs refunds on fees and related claims and a visa class b fair value adjustment turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from the yearago period and up less than from the prior quarter as we continue to support relationship clients commercial loans increased from the yearago quarter relative to the same period consumer loans increased compared with the first quarter of commercial loans grew while consumer loans remained relatively stable total loans ended the period at billion down billion from the prior quarter continuing on to slide keys longstanding commitment to primacy continues to support a stable diverse base of core deposits for funding our total cost of deposits was basis points in q2 and our cumulative deposit beta was since the fed began raising interest rates in march we remain focused on balance sheet management with an eye towards minimizing the total cost of funds average deposits totaled billion for the second quarter of down from the yearago period and were relatively stable across the quarter down approximately million on average yearoveryear we saw declines in retail deposits driven by elevated spend due to inflation normalization from elevated pandemic levels and changing client behavior due to higher rates the decrease in average deposit balances from the prior quarter reflects a continuation of the same trends regular seasonal outflows that we saw in april were more than offset in may and june deposits ended the period at billion up billion from the prior quarter turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the second quarter compared with billion in the yearago and prior quarters down approximately against both periods our net interest margin was for the second quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 yearoveryear net interest income and the net interest margin were impacted by higher interestbearing deposit cost a shift in funding mix to highercost deposits and growth in wholesale borrowings which in part supported elevated cash levels the decline in net interest income was partially offset by higher yields on loans and investments relative to the first quarter our net interest margin was negatively impacted by basis points related to higher interestbearing deposit costs and basis points from a change in funding mix and liquidity partly offset by basis points related to higher earning asset yields and earning asset growth our swap portfolio and shortdated treasuries reduced net interest income by million and lowered our net interest margin by basis points this quarter turning to slide as previously mentioned key has begun to benefit from the maturity of our shortdated swap book and expects to begin to benefit more significantly from increasing swap and treasury maturities as we move forward based on the forward curve we continue to expect a meaningful benefit currently estimated at million annualized in the first quarter of we have continued to take a measured but opportunistic approach to lock in this potential benefit and this analysis includes the addition of hedging activity undertaken beginning in and since we have not and do not plan to replace the swaps rolling off in instead allowing the natural asset sensitivity of the loan book to come through and benefit from higher shortterm rates moving to slide noninterest income was million for the second quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the first quarter the decline in noninterest income from the yearago period reflects a million decline in investment banking and debt placement fees reflecting lower advisory and syndication fees additionally service charges on deposit accounts declined million reflecting previously announced and implemented changes in our nsfod fee structure and lower account analysis fees related to higher interest rates the decline in noninterest income from the first quarter reflects a million decline in investment banking and debt placement driven by lower advisory and syndication fees partially offset by a million increase in corporate services income reflecting an increase in customer derivatives activity i am now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion down million from the year ago period and down million from last quarter compared with the yearago quarter net occupancy expense decreased million reflecting a downsizing of corporate facilities and business service and professional fees decreased million these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in technology expense and a million increase in personnel expense reflecting merit increases and higher benefit costs compared to the prior quarter personnel expense decreased million reflecting lower incentive stockbased compensation and severance additionally other expense decreased million in the second quarter as the first quarter included restructuring charges related to expense actions moving now to slide overall credit quality remains solid for the second quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans delinquencies across portfolio has remained relatively stable our provision for credit losses is million for the second quarter which as we have pointed out exceeded net chargeoffs by million or million aftertax the excess provision increases our allowance for credit keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 losses to of periodend loans despite the increase in the allowance our outlook for net chargeoffs remains well below our throughthecycle targeted level of basis points to basis points now on to slide we ended the second quarter with a common equity tier ratio of up from the prior quarter and within our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our relationship customers and their needs we did not complete any open market share repurchase in the second quarter indiscernible related to employee compensation nor do we expect to engage into material share repurchases in the near term we will continue to focus our capital on supporting relationship client activity and paying dividends on the right side of this slide is the expected reduction in our aoci mark the aoci mark declines by approximately by the end of and by the end of in alignment with recent public remarks from regulators we expect that any changes will be implemented with an appropriate comment and phasein period given that our view is that for any new requirements our reduction in aoci marks and more significantly our future earnings and balance sheet management would allow us to organically accrete capital to the required levels over the necessary period slide provides an outlook for the third and fourth quarter of third and fourth quarter guidance is given relative to each prior quarter respectively similar to our approach in the third quarter of last year we have shifted our guidance to focus on quarterly results this provides a clearest view of trends heading into yearend using the forward curve as of july balance sheet trends are tracking mostly as anticipated we expect average loans to be down to in both the third and fourth quarter versus the prior quarter as we continue to actively manage our balance sheet and recycle capital to support relationship clients we expect average deposits to be relatively stable in both the third and fourth quarter versus prior periods our outlook assumes a cumulative deposit beta approaching by yearend on a linkedquarter basis net interest income is expected to decline to in the third quarter and be flat to down in the fourth quarter as we derive more benefit from the repricing of our swaps and treasuries in we expect growth in both our net interest income and net interest margin our guidance assumes a fed funds rate reaching in the third quarter and remaining flat through yearend these interest rate assumptions along with our expectations for customer behavior and the competitive pricing environment are very fluid and will continue to impact our outlook perspectively noninterest income is estimated to be up to in the third quarter and up to in the fourth quarter versus prior periods reflecting a gradual improvement in capital markets noninterest expense is expected to remain relatively stable both the third and fourth quarters we assume credit quality remains solid and net chargeoffs to average loans to be in the range of basis points to basis points in the third quarter and basis points to basis points in the fourth quarter both below our expected overthecycle targeted range of basis points to basis points our guidance for the third and fourth quarter gap tax rate is to using our quarterly guidance our full year outlook for versus the prior year would be the following net interest income down to fees down to expenses relatively stable net chargeoffs of basis points to basis points for the year and a gaap tax rate of to keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 we feel confident in the foundation of our business in our diverse highquality deposit base the durability of our balanced franchise and our improved risk profile despite nearterm headwinds we continue to be focused on execution in and positioning the company to benefit from the strong longterm core earnings power of our business with that i will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions one moment please for the first question that will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning scott scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey clark i wanted to talk about the nii outlook so the pace of nii degradation it looks like it should slow considerably in the second half the fourth quarter especially maybe a little more color on the main factors youre seeing that would allow that to happen i know you sort of rationalized the beta expectation and of course you got the treasures and swaps but just curious to hear from your view sort of the main factors in that outlook clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure thanks scott and i think this will be a topic were spending a little time on so first let me just remind you that the nim would have been without the swaps and treasuries which were about million in the quarter just to give you kind of a level set if you go back to the most recent guidance we would have guided you to the second quarter being at or near the bottom so to your point scott its a little bit of continued decline what id say is the fundamentals of our business are very consistent with that comment whats changed is the rate expectation in the back half of the year so at that time we were expecting two cuts in the fourth quarter as i stated in the prepared remarks were now going to see kind of one hike and a flat through the end of the year and i think the implication of that is the betas will drift a little higher through the back half of the year and the swaps and the treasuries will be a little bit bigger drag than we previously expected that said we do think that both of those factors are moderating so were seeing deposit balances stabilize and were seeing the slope of that beta increase flatten and were continuing to see swaps mature and the treasury portfolio will begin to mature now in the third quarter so well see opportunity as those two books come off so keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 what were seeing then is that flattening of the nii and nim trajectory as we go into fourth quarter and we wanted to reflect that by providing guidance for each individual quarter as we go beyond that into i think well start to see a pickup slide isolates the swap and treasury portfolios so consistent with what we did last quarter as i stated a few minutes ago million drag in q2 or basis points and the way i think about it just in the simplest terms is billion of us treasuries that start maturing in this quarter with a basically an average yield i think of basis points and billion of swaps between now and the end of with a received fixed rate between basis points and basis points so put those together you are looking at close to billion with an almost yield pickup by the end of and that would get you to the million or million per quarter that we have on slide in the deck as of q1 so again in that case were trying to isolate just the treasuries and swaps and provide as much as transparency as we can there on these specific headwinds what i would say that doesnt include is the relative betas or funding cost that go with that but i just want to touch on that because again i think its important to understand if you look at the million which is equivalent to the million that we quote this quarter that was consistent with a different rate environment where rates were coming down at the end of the quarter or the end of the year and we would have had a slightly muted impact on the nii pickup as i just said rates we think are going to be higher now the betas will be higher but commensurately the pickup in those swaps and treasuries has gone from million to million so those are going to move in sync slide is intended to be again isolated to the treasuries and swaps just to make sure were giving you as much disclosure on those as we can scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats extraordinarily helpful color so i appreciate that i do not want to put words in your mouth but in the aggregate would your expectation be that nii ends up sort of bottoming around end of this year maybe early next year but then does see a more visible inflection back up as sort of the pricing dynamics weighing on funding costs but you then start to get a more material and visible benefits from the swap and treasury maturities is that the best way to think about it clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i think that was very well stated scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you very much i appreciate it clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah thanks scott operator well go next to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp hey good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning chris i just wanted to follow up i think on the same line of questioning that scott around nii so appreciate the up the lift from swaps and treasuries i think the concern when you talk to investors has been the value before we get to that point has kept getting deeper throughout the year when we look at this guidance for the back half i think clark you mentioned implies negative yearoveryear give us a sense of just a level of confidence in the guidance that this is it absent any big change in the interest rate backdrop how good do you feel and the level of visibility that you have and i appreciate it has been tough for the entire industry to handicap this but any color you can provide would be helpful clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure so look i think the biggest changes we have gone through the year has been the rate level so given your commentary on sort of relatively stable rates i think we feel very good about the trajectory were sharing here and i would say overall our deposit betas i feel like are very much in line with the peer group we did some catching up because we outperformed last year but i feel like thats very consistent with whats happening in the industry and we just happen to have the specific headwinds right now on swaps and treasuries but again as those come off we think were prepared to get the benefit of that so i would say that in the expected rate environment our confidence would be good ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and second question i think chris talked about two things one is focus on expenses i see the guidance for flat expenses for the back half give us a sense if there is a bigger opportunity here on flexing expense leverage as you move into back half and as at least the street things about eps and also around any proactive rwa actions i think you mentioned getting rid of or exiting nonstrategic relationships how impactful could that be for capital christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so thats a great question and as you put them together they are closely related so if you just step back here is how we see the future as all the ph regs unfold whats not going to change for us ebrahim is were going to remain focused on our relationship model were going to stay focused on targeted scale but i think there is going to be incredible and intense scrutiny around the duration the granularity the composition of the deposit base and thats one of the reasons that clark talk about that we pivoted and make sure we protected our deposits whereas we were kind of leading in terms of not having a lot of beta keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 next gets to i think it gets directly to your question i think there is going to be a significant change in loan to deposit ratios as you kind of run all this through your models and we run it through our models i think loan to deposit ratios for category banks if theyre mid now theyre going to be significantly less and we are very focused on this so keep in mind last year we grew our loans kind of highdoubledigits i mean like around i should say highteens and then we were on a path to grow to but that all happened in the first quarter before the events of march and we not only stopped that growth but actually pushed it back billion by the end of this quarter which i think is really really important and right now what were doing is were scrutinizing every portfolio we have in the bank ive always said that on a riskadjusted basis most standalone loans dont return their cost of capital and if you think about having to carry more capital and you think about the capital you have being a lot more expensive then you can rest assured there will be a lot of creditonly relationships that wont be strategic to us so well preserve our capital for those relationships as you know we can do a lot with them but we will be continuing to push down our assets and you see in the guidance that clark gave you were looking at average loans being down to in the third quarter and down to in the fourth quarter we will hit that so and then the second part of your question which is also related as we shrink the balance sheet were going to have to make sure that our expense base is rightsized for the future asset base of our company and rest assured were looking at that as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and then chris if i may squeeze one in just give us a sense of the dividend there has been a lot of focus the dividend yield as a chairman of the board i know its evaluated every quarter but how confident are you in terms of dividend sustainability as we kind of ph clock through the back half into christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure well the headline there is i am confident but as a board member we spend a lot of time talking about strategy and talking about dividend policy we manage this company for the longterm and the dividend policy is no exception our capital priorities as i just mentioned are unchanged its to support our clients our prospects and to pay dividends and to your point last week our board did approve a third quarter dividend keep in mind over our history we have paid out very very often its just been in the form of both buybacks and a cash dividend so were obviously paying close attention to that i feel good about it let me talk a little bit about capital because its so related in spite of some of the challenges clark mentioned this quarter we grew capital we paid a dividend and we built reserves and so as we think about taking this longterm perspective when you look at our normalized earnings power of our company and that is the reversal of the nii headwind into a tailwind and also having a reasonable expectation around investment banking fees the earnings power of the company is strong we can build capital there clark mentioned the aoci burndown by by and then as i just mentioned this game plan that we have around riskweighted assets will be important and then the last thing that i think is really important and its going to be important i think as the cycle continues to play out is we have a well positioned credit book and theres nothing that destroys capital faster and in bigger hunks than having a bunch of keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 credit losses so i put all those things together we take a longterm perspective on the dividend we feel good about it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all very helpful color thank you so much christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure thank you ebrahim operator well go next to the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys just a couple of followups on the loan side obviously you said that you are retaining a little bit back to kind of that upperteens point of your investment banking originations and im just wondering does that have any throughput in terms of the ability to generate business in the investment bank and i guess connected just then your confidence in the second half improvement in the investment bank is that because youre starting to see things get back out the door as opposed to keep on the balance sheet like you have been doing for the last couple years christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so first of all thank you for your question ken its complicated by the fact that as usual mix has a lot to do with it so we actually distributed a lot of debt in the second quarter the reality is a lot of it was investment grade so in terms of investment banking fees not so great in terms of keeping the velocity of our balance sheet very very important but the premise of your question as we look to shrink our balance sheet the ability to distribute paper to a lot of different places will in fact be important and so that will be an important part of the mix in terms of what im seeing heres kind of what im seeing one our ma backlog yearoveryear is up our total backlog is down but down kind of midsingle digits which is really not a big deal what im most encouraged by is not that im seeing things coming out of the pipeline obviously in the equity market were starting to see that youre seeing that for sure but what im really pleased with is i talk to our clients all the time in fact as recently as yesterday i talked to one of our large clients who is proceeding with a transaction thats been sort of percolating for some time as people kind of go through the price discovery so its really more a gut feel on my part having been around this business just for so long ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and just one more laurel road ph just some cross factors there too obviously with the debt moratorium and what happens there but just as far as also being scrutinizing every incremental loan that you are making just can you talk about the laurel road specifically but how youre also thinking through that in terms of the other consumer portfolios keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure ill start and then im going to flip it over to clark but its a great question and its one as we sort of had gone through our reset weve spent a lot of time talking about these capabilities that we need to make sure we have before we bought laurel road they securitized and distributed of their loans going forward were going to be securitizing and distributing their loans we have the people and we have the ability to do it so its a really good question while im on the point of laurel road the other thing weve done on laurel road is we really made two pivots and thats been going on with the federal student loan payment holiday one we turned it into a complete digital platform whereby we can have loans deposits importantly checking account card mortgage etcetera the other thing that we did is when we bought gradfin and were in the early days of this ken but gradfin is a market leader in advising people around not only public service loan forgiveness but the whole incomebased debt repayment which the government is really opening up the aperture for its falsely complex and you need someone to sort of help you through it which is a good thing but thats another pivot that weve made there were getting back to your question about sort of our assetlight model clark why dont you talk about speak to that particularly around mortgage as well clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so i think largely were going to look to continue to distribute i mean we do have capabilities now when we distribute a lot of debt were going to expand that more consistently i think to the consumer side the point i think on laurel road that chris made that i just want to reiterate is we never acquired it to be a student loanonly generator that was kind of the headline it was intended to be a full service banking platform we continue to build toward that and we think its got some really unique and differentiated capability around this incomedriven repayment and public service loan forgiveness and you may have seen some commentary out of the government in the past week around the idr specifically and some of the complexity to that which i think will accrue to our benefit over time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it so if i can wrap that together is it fair to say that the tradeoff of less nii or less loan growth over time getting the ldr down youll sacrifice some nii help on the capital side and then move towards more of a fee generating model just in term yeah clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah i think thats the right idea i think were also demonstrating more deposit growing capability there and again were still relatively new in having those capabilities but i think thats the right way to think about it so more of a fee advice and core banking generator than a loan shop ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator well go next to the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning john clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just going back to the million on slide at the nii pickup from treasury and swap maturities so let me just ask it this way aside from a change in the rate backdrop and your interest rate outlook what could prevent you from realizing that i know theres a fair amount of investor skepticism around the ability of that million to find its way into the numbers from your perspective how do you size up the risks what are the risks that you do not realize that what gets in the way is it more on the deposit side or is it in asset side of the picture that could prevent that from being realized clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so i think i mean the rate available when the treasuries and swaps mature is sort of the single biggest factor and that would have been reflected in the million moving to million so and again thats isolating kind of the income portion of that i do think theres a couple variables so think about the treasuries whether or not we reinvest them in the market use them as replacement funding or hold them in cash today those are relatively neutral over time if theres a disparity between those three you might see a little bit of pickup or drop depending on which decision we make but today its kind of a push across all three of those and then your other point was right which is the funding side of this so i tried to reflect that as well in my comments of lower beta expectations at the end of q1 when we shared you a million opportunity higher beta expectations here today but that opportunity is going up kind of in a related way so i dont know and i dont want to pretend those are kind of one to one type but i would think about those moving at least in the fairly correlated direction john pancari q analyst evercore isi keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 got it okay all right thank you and then separately as you continue to exit or as you are evaluating the non strategic businesses and other optimization just to confirm any progress you make incrementally on that front that would be in addition like to the guidance of a decline of to on the loan front so anything on the incremental optimization that would provide that would lead to potential incremental downtime to these numbers clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i think if there were something more significant than what chris referred to which is maybe a very active management of the business that would be incremental but i think what we built into this guidance is how were running the business right now john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you operator well go next to the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right good morning i want to follow up on the kind of the capital line of questions i guess the first thing is a lot of your peers seem to be targeting plus on the cet1 and obviously there is capital proposals coming out but i guess first question is what are your thoughts in terms of that to target moving closer to to like some of your peers christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so matt we think to is the right number for us given our business mix if you think about of our ci book being investmentgrade if you think about the fact that we dont have really any credit card business to speak of if you think about the fact that at funding we have fico scores in our consumer business of or so we think its the right number and obviously at and having grown it from this quarter were right in the strike zone having said all of that we like everybody else will wait and digest anything that comes out in the nottoodistant future and reevaluate it at that point but for our business right now we feel thats the right number matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and in terms of the rwa optimization is it possible to size that or give a range and the timing of when youll get the benefit of that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp were looking at a lot of different things right now im most comfortable just directing you to the guidance that we gave around loans but as i mentioned were looking at other things as well ill leave it at that keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you matt operator well go next to the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i wanted to clarify your comments earlier on the call that you believe that the ldrs for the industry and category banks in particular will have to move lower does that mean that you have some room to optimize some of your loan deposit funding like longer term debt or is that unlikely given the potential for tlac rules to also apply for category banks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so i think that we do have that and you would have seen us do a little bit of that even here in the second quarter so i think youre following question around tlac or longterm debt is the right one as well and well wait as chris just mentioned for the proposed and final rules but we do think that reduction in loan to deposit over time gives us an opportunity to reduce reliance on wholesale funding manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then maybe on the credit side given the acl was up this quarter as well was that entirely modeldriven and i guess how much of a buildup is there more of a buildup to do and what sort of an environment do you have baked into that current reserve ratio christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so just from a cecl perspective obviously its very forwardlooking in terms of what percentage is modeldriven what percentage kind of portfoliodriven i think you can assume its kind of sort of half and half and my assumption is that just to step back for a second my assumption is that we will have i think the fed is going to successfully engineer a soft landing i think it will probably happen in having said that what i dont think is yet in the market is the impact of all the rate increases and also the impact of banks tightening down on credit and i think both of those will have an impact on the economy and as such were pretty conservative in terms of how we look at things and so the first thing we always do is look at anything that is leveraged and anything where the cash flows could be in anyway impacted by a slowing economy so thats kind of the lens that we looked at it there is nothing specific there is nothings that were particularly worried about we kind of looked across all the portfolios keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure as we if we do move towards a soft landing would that imply that you dont need the acl ratios to really move higher christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah right now i feel like we have reserved what we need to reserve for sure manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator thank you well go next to the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah mike we can good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay good morning so you are guiding nii down to in the third quarter and another to in the fourth quarter what does that mean for your nim even in broad terms it was i guess it was in the second quarter clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah we would expect it to be relatively flat in the third quarter and then start to trend up mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so my question is look thats the lowest core margin possibly ever at least since the global financial crisis i mean that is such a slim margin here and then so i guess why such a low margin and even after the increase i guess i get to around nii of about billion per quarter which is where you were in the second quarter of which is before the fed rate hikes and you can correct the math but youre using a midpoint to your nii of million it goes down to million next quarter then million in the fourth quarter and then i guess youre saying it goes up by about one fourth from there by the end of the year right so million plus onefourth to that million annualized gets you around billion nii keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 so i am sorry a lot of numbers around here but in the end you wind up with a nim you wind up with nii thats at a level before the fed rate hikes so even with the potential to improve it next year which would be an incremental positive youre still not getting credit for any of the fed rate hikes that took place so what happened with the structural positioning of the balance sheet that leads to such a low nim and nii clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so i mean what i where i start there mike is if you look at the composition of our loan book in general it is in our view higher credit quality but higher credit quality comes generally with lower yields so we have over of our ci book is investment grade we have super prime consumer books so those are not going to carry the same rates broadly in something like credit card which we have very little exposure to or personal consumer loans which we have very little exposure to so in that regard were starting probably structurally from a little bit lower nii but the counter to that is what we think is higher credit quality book so ill have to go back through the specific math you have there but i am happy to do that and talk about it offline but i think thats at least a starting point but we think over time a nim that starts with the is not an unreasonable place for us to be mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so is that right so next year you are guiding basically from the fourth quarter level where it stabilizes at least the nii should go by about onefourth by the end of the year now as you are guiding basically close to million for the fourth quarter or little above and then youre saying you are gaining million annualized by the end of next year so that would imply nii will go onefourth higher from that fourth quarter level all else equal is that correct logic clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp not exactly so the million is annualized as of the first quarter of mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay just a little bit later got it clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc but eventually that nii goes up by onefourth clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp correct keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i said the words all else equal what would not be equal what could help the nii and what could help that nim go back from to what is that logic missing clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp well i think its i mean the obvious one right there is the basis points that comes from swaps and treasuries so thats what were talking about and betas i think getting or general rates and betas getting kind of more in line with historical averages or overall funding cost so as we just talked about we have some opportunity to reduce the wholesale funding which is obviously expensive and we still yet to see pullthrough on loan spread so i think there is a variety of factors that could improve that many of which were either not experienced at the moment or havent seen kind of broadly in the industry mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last one chris you started off saying you expect investment banking to be stronger in the second half of the year its been some drought for the industry what gives you confidence either for the industry for key or for both christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp mike i mentioned this earlier in the conversation it is based on my experience being around this business as long as i have people will defer transactions for so long but eventually sort of the logjam starts to break i think were starting to see it a little bit in the new issue equity business and ive just been out talking to clients and i think people that have put deals on hold now for months either these deals are going to start to happen or theyre going to move on and do something else so its based on one just looking and scrutinizing the backlog and then secondly just more instinct as im out talking to people mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so fish or cut bait time christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah for sure mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you mike keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 operator well go next to the line of erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp hi erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc first question for hey what was your adjusted cet1 in the quarter including aoci and i presume that cet1 target would be like your fully loaded target even after we get an npr that would be inclusive of aoci and cet1 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so whatever that ultimate target is erika will reflect the appropriate rule so if the aoci of that is eliminated then yes i think you stated that correctly so that level for aoci afs is about erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it so my second question is for you chris and i apologize if this sounds challenging but this is sort of the big conversation that im having with longterm shareholders clearly the stock price performance today is trying to price out some of the dividend fears that were in the market given where your yield is and i think a big discussion im having with your investors is that that payout right that you mentioned and that happened for this quarter it feels like three years ago sort of in the pandemic you were getting the same questions about the sustainability of your dividend and it feels like at the end of the day its really the denominator that has been challenged so whether its been expenses previously or having the balance sheet set up to have these receivefixed rates that essentially imply to zero rate environment forever it just feels like your efficiency ratio isnt just quite right and doesnt really reflect the potential of the business so as you think about the next three years how are you what discussion are you going to have with your board to have that earning the potential of your franchise really be reflected in your earnings power i mean the nim is the nim and i get the swaps but like i feel like that key gets wrapped up in a dividend conversation the entire time not necessarily because the dividend is an albatross but it feels like that your earnings power is so sensitive to vagaries of the macro christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well first of all i appreciate the question i agree with the premise of it our business the challenging thing for us and we just i was with my board last week and we were talking at length about this our challenge is our business is performing well we clearly are underearning and were underearning based on how we have our balance sheet positioned and thats why i mentioned one of the things that gives me confidence erika is when keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 we get the normalized earnings power of the company we just talked about investment banking fees thats driven by something else but what we really need is the position that we have which is liability sensitive at a time when you wouldnt want to be liability sensitive we need for that to burn off and the passage of time will do a lot on that unfortunately it is the passage of time but as i mentioned the burndown is between now and and this is as it relates to aoci by so that is the issue and i think we are said differently we are under earning right now and we will be overearning as the position unwinds and rolls down erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator and well go next to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi clark christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris you touched on in your opening remarks about this commercial mortgage servicing portfolio i think you said its billion can you share with us the special servicing segment within that business obviously with the challenges in the commercial real estate market particularly in the cmbs market i suspect your special servicing business has picked up maybe some color there christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure well thanks for the question its a great business its a great business because it generates a bunch of deposits through escrows which are more important today than they ever have been in my career its also important because its countercyclical so for those of you that arent as familiar with the business we are the named special servicer when a large complex debt financing is put together and so when youre the named special servicer you get sort of what i would think of as sort of a ticking fee and then if in fact it goes into the fall and this is all office real estate we are the workout agent and to gerards point we just set for the second quarter in a row a record in terms of special servicing fees and so i think that will continue and this wont surprise you gerard but more than twothirds of what is in active special servicing is office and i think thats going to continue and i think office is going to be its not going to be keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 a challenge for key because its not an asset class we focus on but i think office is going to continue to be a significant challenge gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and chris based on your experience with this these fees stay with you for a while since the workout phase takes quite a bit of time christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp oh yeah these are very large think of kind of very large advisory fees that take a lot of people these are very complex capital structures its not unusual for these fees on a single deal to be million million million gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just sticking with this can you share with us just on commercial loans not commercial real estate necessarily just what you guys are doing to get out in front of any potential challenges we could see if the economy i know you said a soft landing is what youre thinking but if the economy does lead to more delinquencies and defaults what are you guys doing now to get in front of that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah well this is an area where we spend a lot of time we are as it relates to the ci book particularly focused on anything that has floating rate debt thats leveraged and so for us our leveraged book literally is the same that it was a decade ago its under of our loans and its focused on our industry verticals but we are theres a lot of us and mark midkiffs in the room with me who is our chief risk officer he and i and others are laying eyes on this we feel really good about where the portfolio is but anytime you go into an environment where you have declining ebitda and a business with a lot of leverage and the cost of capital going up youve got to pay close attention and thats where we pay very close attention we feel good about we feel really good about all of our portfolios but thats where i spent some of my time because thats whats most vulnerable gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you gerard operator and well go next to steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning steve alexopoulos steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to first follow up on your answer chris to ebrahims question are you signaling that the door is not open at all in terms of potentially rightsizing the dividend christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i wouldnt say its not open at all the reason i would put that caveat is im yet to see the new capital rules but what im saying is im very comfortable with our dividend payout and the trajectory of our business under the current construct steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats helpful and then on the fee income guide i heard the messaging around green shoots in capital markets but are those really needed to get us to this range right the up to and then sorry up to to and then to or are there other factors which give us some cushion if the ibbs dont come back that you could still deliver on the fee income guide christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp theres other areas where we have cushion but i mean investment banking fees are a big component of that and we need to have more trajectory in the back half of the year on investment banking fees than we did in the front half of the year in order to hit these numbers steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then finally just big picture view obviously lot of questions on the nim im just as surprised as mike seeing for clark how do you think about managing the balance sheet and interest rate risk differently so you dont get in this situation again where the nim is as low dividend payout ratio is this high youre missing on the nii guidance which is really all tied to what were seeing in the swaps but how do you think about big picture so once you do get into a nim range that you sort of hang around there thanks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah and its a great question i think it probably requires a longer answer but short story steve i think you just have to be probably considering a variety of additional scenarios and being a little bit more dynamic in the direction and pace of rate movements so i think if rates had moved in an orderly fashion this would be much less of an issue they did not as you know and i think we just have to be more dynamic in our thinking about putting on certain positions keycorp key corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator thank you and there are no further questions in queue at this time ill turn it back to mr gorman christopher m
