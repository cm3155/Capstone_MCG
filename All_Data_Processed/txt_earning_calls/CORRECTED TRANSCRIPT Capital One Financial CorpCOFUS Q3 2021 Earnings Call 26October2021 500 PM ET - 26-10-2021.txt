andrew m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the third quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share included in our results for the quarter was a million legal reserve build net of this adjusting item earnings per share in the quarter were on a gaap basis preprovision earnings were billion an increase of relative to a quarter ago periodend loans held for investment grew billion or as we had strong loan growth across all of our businesses recall that we moved billion of loans to held for sale late in the second quarter so average loans in the third quarter grew more modestly at revenue increased in the linked quarter largely driven by the loan growth i just described coupled with margin expansion in our card business operating expenses grew in the quarter with total noninterest expense increasing in addition to strong preprovision earnings the pl was aided by a provision benefit in the quarter as record low chargeoffs were more than offset by an allowance release turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail we released million of allowance in the third quarter as the effects of continued actual strong credit performance and a reduction in qualitative factors drove a decline in allowance balance which was partially offset by loan growth in the quarter turning to slide you can see our allowance coverage ratios continue to decline across all of our segments driven by the factors i just described turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was the lcr remained stable and continues to be well above the regulatory requirement our liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately billion down billion from the prior quarter as we continue to run off excess liquidity built during the pandemic the decline in total liquidity was driven by a modest reduction in the size of our investment portfolio and billion in lower ending cash balances which were used to fund loan growth and share repurchases the decline in cash balances had an impact on our nim which i will discuss in more detail on page you can see that our third quarter net interest margin was basis points higher than q2 and basis points higher than the year ago quarter the linked quarter increase in nim was largely driven by four factors capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 first the decline in average cash balances i just described second margin expansion in our domestic card business third loan growth in our domestic card business and lastly the benefit of one additional day in the quarter turning to slide i will end by covering our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the third quarter down basis points from the prior quarter net income in the quarter was more than offset by an increase in riskweighted assets and share repurchases we repurchased billion of common stock in the third quarter and have approximately billion remaining of our current board authorization of billion at the beginning of the third quarter we began operating under the federal reserves stress capital buffer framework resulting in a minimum cet1 capital requirement of as of october however based on our internal modeling we continue to estimate that our cet1 capital need is around before i turn the call over to rich let me describe a few items related to our preferred stock on october we announced our intention to redeem our outstanding preferred stock series g and series h in early december as a result of the full quarter of recent issuances and a partial quarter of the planned redemptions we expect fourth quarter preferred dividends to remain elevated at around million looking ahead to q1 we expect the run rate for preferred dividends to decline to approximately million per quarter barring additional activity with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks andrew ill begin on slide with our credit card business strong yearoveryear purchase volume growth and strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of and provision for credit losses improved significantly credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on side as you can see on slide third quarter domestic card revenue grew year over year purchase volume for the third quarter was up year over year and up compared to the third quarter of and the rebound in loan growth continued with ending loan balances up billion or about year over year ending loans also grew from the sequential quarter ahead of typical seasonal growth of around ending loan growth was the result of strong growth in purchase volume as well as the traction were getting with new account originations and line increases partially offset by continued high payment rates payment rates leveled off in the third quarter but remain near historic highs the flip side of high payment rates is strong credit and credit results remain strikingly strong the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement year over year the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was a basis points improvement over the prior year the pace of year overyear improvement is slowing particularly for the delinquency rate domestic card revenue margin was up basis points year over year to two factors drove most of the increase revenue margin benefited from spend velocity which is purchase volume growth and net interchange outpacing loan growth and favorable current credit performance enabled us to recognize a higher proportion of capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 finance charges and fees in third quarter revenue as well this creditdriven revenue impact generally tracks domestic card credit trends total company marketing expense was million in the quarter including marketing in card auto and retail banking our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends we continue to see attractive opportunities to grow our domestic card business our loan well our growth opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation turning opportunities into actual growth requires investment and once again were leaning further into marketing to drive growth and to build our franchise at the same time were keeping a watchful eye on the competitive environment which is intensifying looking ahead we expect a sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter thats consistent with typical historical pattern pulling up our domestic card business continues to deliver significant value as we invest to build our franchise slide summarizes third quarter results for our consumer banking business consistent auto growth and strong auto credit are the main themes in the third quarter consumer banking results our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continue to drive strong growth in our auto business driven by auto third quarter ending loans increased year over year in the consumer banking business average loans also grew auto originations were up year over year on a linked quarter basis auto originations were down from the exceptionally high level in the second quarter as we discussed last quarter pentup demand and high auto prices have driven a second quarter surge in originations across the auto marketplace third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or year over year average deposits were also up year over year consumer banking revenue increased from the prioryear quarter driven by growth in auto loans third quarter provision for credit losses improved by million year over year driven by an allowance release in our auto business credit results in our auto business remain strong year over year the third quarter chargeoff rate improved basis points to and the delinquency rate improved basis points to looking at sequential quarter trends the chargeoff rate increased from the unprecedented negative chargeoff rate in the second quarter and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points from the second quarter consistent with historical seasonal patterns moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business third quarter ending loan balances were up year over year driven by growth in selected industry specialties average loans were down ending deposits grew from the third quarter of as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity quarterly average deposits also increased year over year third quarter revenue was up from the prioryear quarter and from the linked quarter recall that revenue in the second quarter was unusually low due to the impact of moving billion of commercial real estate loans to heldforsale commercial credit performance remains strong in the third quarter the commercial banking annualized charge off rate was basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was our commercial banking business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capability capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning in the third quarter we drove strong growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and new accounts and loan growth is picking up credit remains strikingly strong across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders in the marketplace the pandemic has clearly accelerated digital adoption the game is changing from new and permanent shifts in virtual and hybrid work to more digital products and exceptional customer experiences to new fintech innovation and business models the common thread throughout all of this is technology and the stakes are rising faster than ever before competitors are embracing the realization that technology capabilities may be an existential issue the investment flowing into fintechs is breathtaking and its growing we can see investors voting with their feet in stunning fintech valuations and the war for tech talent continues to escalate which will drive up tech labor costs even before any head count increases all these developments underscore the size of the opportunity for players who lead the way in transforming how banking works and capital one is very well positioned to do just that we are in the ninth year of our technology transformation from the bottom of the tech stack up we were an original fintech and we have built modern technology capabilities at scale but what is also clear in the marketplace is that the timeframes for investment and innovation are compressing the imperative to invest is now we have been on a long journey to drive down operating efficiency ratio powered by revenue growth and digital productivity gains our journey will need to incorporate the investment imperative of the rapidly changing marketplace and it is likely to pressure operating efficiency ratio along the way pulling way up were living through an extraordinary time of accelerating digital change our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our opportunity its setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking and its the engine that drives enduring value creation over the long term and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may want to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup question and if you have any follow up questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call keith please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey rich ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey rich so rich you talked about competition across the industry has intensified you noted in both traditional players and fintechs and yet it seems like your strategy is working as evidenced by the betterthanpeer growth metrics in credit so i was just wondering can you maybe just talk about the competitive environment youre seeing out there how does it compare to maybe the middle part of the last decade when we saw competition accelerate and where do you think it goes from here and then i guess maybe wrap that in with what does it mean for growth for the company and i have one followup question thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay ryan great question let me really talk about the card competition thats probably at the heart of your questions here but we can also expand on that but in the domestic in the card business competition has definitely intensified especially in rewards marketing and media activity are i would say approaching pre pandemic levels and competitors continue to lean into marketing and originations direct mail is back to levels originations have also recovered across the industry and are above prepandemic levels the pricing continues to be mostly stable our rewards offerings have become richer and we continue to watch that very closely we saw some modest increases in upfront bonuses mainly in the form of limited time offers and in travel as demand returns rewards earned rates have also increased with some of the new product structures introduced recently particularly in the cash back space and of course theres also a lot of increasing activity with fintechs such as buy now pay later installment lending and we talked about the breathtaking levels of investment by venture capital into that industry and by the way all of this is incredibly natural how a market should be reacting if we didnt see everything that i just described to you i would wonder if i woke up in the wrong place this is incredibly natural but in the context of this increased competition we continue to see good opportunities for growth which are enhanced by our tech capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 transformation and were keeping a close eye on competition looking for adverse selection that may come as a result of that and we are underwriting with the expectation of higher losses in the future now you asked for a comparison ryan about how does this compare with the last decade certainly in the middle of the last decade competition in the credit card space really started picking up but and some of the descriptors i would use here i would use there in the sense that more spending on marketing and originations being kind of robust for the industry back then we saw a bunch of things that we really dont see now but well have to keep an eye out for that what we saw back then is very aggressive behavior in ways that was more than just marketing it really was in the form of looser underwriting and in practices some consumer practices that we did not feel were fully in the customers interest so there were a lot of things to react to in that marketplace and if you look back capital ones loan growth kind of slowed in the card business as we moderated in the face of what we thought was competition that was over the top and that was going to not only make it more costly to originate but much more importantly could impact the quality of the credit quality of what is being booked so we do not feel right now that were at a time like that we have to be on the lookout for natural things that happens as competitors continue to heat up their efforts to grow but i think were in a pretty good period ryan right now in the marketplace and for capital one as indicated by my comment about marketing we see good opportunities were leaning into that and we have our having learned over the years and seen a lot of things ryan were going to have our eye out for things that we think are over the top ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color there rich and if i can just ask one quick followup i know credit is as good as its ever been and i know you dont have a crystal ball but yours is probably better than mine so i was wondering that given that this downturn has been like no other how are you thinking about the trajectory of credit over an intermediate timeframe do you think we could run well below normal for an extended period of time or do you think there is the risk of fast normalization as the industry has become more concerned about thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp i think we are ryan certainly in a pretty extraordinary well not even pretty extraordinary were in an extraordinary place from a credit point of view and im speaking of the industry and obviously capital one as well and not only for our credit card business but also really across the board at capital one so as we think about where it could go from here lets think a little bit about whats driving where it is so obviously the high level of consumer support through the government stimulus has been a factor although thats mostly in the rearview mirror theres some lingering benefits in terms of the consumer balance sheet that come from that but this will be a good time to watch how credit performs in the basically in the absence of that weve also had widespread industry forbearance and consumers themselves have behaved very rationally through this period of uncertainty generally saving more spending less and paying down debt and then on top of that weve seen strong labor markets so far this year with very high demand for workers solid wage growth which should support consumers as government stimulus expires so where does everything go from here it feels inevitable that losses will increase from the exceptionally low levels of the past year and of where we are but i think the timing its much easier to have conviction about what will happen than the timing of that were looking for signs of normalization card delinquencies ticked up modestly in august and september although this is the time of year when we tend to see seasonal increases in delinquencies capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 so we this is just a i think this is a very strong time and the i think most companies are enjoying the strength that most banks enjoying the strength that they have i think theyre leaning into their opportunities and for capital one i think our opportunities are particularly good because of the technology that we the shoulders that we stand on but with a watchful eye for normalization that will absolutely inevitably happen and by the way when it happens thats normal thats not necessarily alarming at all it would be surprising if it didnt happen but well just watch out for the extremes of behavior and in the meantime lean into our opportunities jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich you talked a lot about the competitive dynamic in the credit card industry and talked about some steps youre taking from an underwriting standpoint to kind of make up for that could you talk a little bit about how you think about the ability to expand credit lines for your customers because thats always been a big factor in terms of generating kind of ongoing loan growth and strong spreads i do have a followup question thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so moshe we are as you know we talked about continuing our originations going in prior years sometimes while we were holding back online with the caution about the environment that we were in and we talked about the coiled spring that that represents and so we always take the philosophy of trying to continue to build the underlying franchise and then expand the lines as we see validation about the strength of the marketplace and the strength of the individual customers and we are gradually increasing credit lines nothing too dramatic but consistent with how were leaning in in general we are increasing credit lines gradually so that will be another boost on the loan growth side moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you and just as a followup you talked about the potential for pressure in the efficiency ratio i mean youve had some pretty strong revenue growth could you talk about i mean obviously one would think that that kind of helps from the standpoint of being able to fund the investment could you talk about what factors would drive periods of time where that efficiency ratio would be pressured versus times where it would be improving richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah well look revenue growth is the best friend of efficiency ratio as you point out moshe and our philosophy i think some companies sort of drive try to drive a very sustained efficiency ratio improvement by just squeezing costs out and were certainly trying to drive a lot of efficiencies from technology but our philosophy capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 is certainly that leaning into investing in technology and in growth opportunities can be an engine for revenue growth and that combined with digital efficiencies can help drive a sustained longterm improvement in efficiency ratio and of course weve enjoyed something like a basis point improvement in efficiency ratio from to when the pandemic kind of interrupted our process the reason i pointed out the my comment about efficiency ratio a few minutes ago was pointing out some of the pressures on the cost side that really come from the sweeping digital change thats transforming the marketplace and the compressed timeframe for investment and innovation and so new and traditional competitors embracing the need to invest in technology the arms race for tech talent is fierce and in fact its the biggest talent arms race that ive seen in my three decades of building capital one and that moshe thats a disappointing one because that raises the tide level of tech costs without generating in a sense any benefits directly from that and just talking about the fintechs for a minute heres some striking data investments in fintechs through the first there quarters of this year has been more than billion or on an annualized basis of course thats billion and thats more than double last years total and i mean those are just breathtaking investment numbers and thats a huge assault on our industry from a kind of a defensive point of view as we react to that but also i look at this and say thats a clear indication that banking is ripe for transformation which we have believed for many many years so this all shows up in the need to invest both in technology itself and in leading digital products to gain competitive advantage and the clock is ticking so were in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace and we have invested for years to build a modern tech stack we have a deep heritage in big data and analytics and we have a large customer franchise and a national brand so i really like our positioning and our chances but we do have to invest to capitalize on the opportunity so moshe the pulling way up the pressures come really from two things which both derive from one thing which is the rapidly changing marketplace so youve got the cost pressure in terms of tech wages and the compressing time frames for innovation across the industry and we just wanted to share that with investors and that we are leaning in to capitalize on this opportunity and all other things being equal that pressures efficiency ratio of course when you pull way up everything i just talked about maybe not so much the tech labor cost but the investment imperative is in service of the same longerterm objectives enhancing growth building a franchise and very importantly driving greater efficiency jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hello betsy capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc rich wanted to understand in the spend numbers that you generated in the quarter just want to get a sense as to what youre seeing in terms of where theres been change at the margin has this spend been accelerating in any specific type of customer maybe the higher end or the starter outers and then the degree to which you think thats sustainable here going forward what are you sensing in terms of spend trajectory from here and then i have a followup thanks betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc could you hear me okay andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy this is andrew richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp oh sorry sorry andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah i can hear you but we had rich on mute for a second richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp i was on mute sorry betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp let me start over betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 great it was so eloquent i cant repeat what i said now darn it but the spend growth is really an acrossthe board thing from mass market customers to the heavy spenders that we have in our portfolio and virtually every spend category is up and its up over last year its up over two years ago the only laggard versus two years ago i shouldnt say laggard basically the travel and entertainment category has kind of caught up with where it was two years ago but given that you saw our overall purchase volume numbers are up compared to it just kind of shows you how much pretty much all the rest of the categories are surging ahead so thats partly a comment on the marketplace and its also partly a comment about capital one and our the traction that were getting in spend across our business obviously you can see from our marketing and from our products and weve spent years investing in building a spender franchise and we the numbers that weve been posting are indicative of a lot of traction there now im going to im not going to give guidance on where its going to go from here i think its got good momentum but also i think consumers have been sort of making up for lost time and i think as they break out being so cooped up in the pandemic the spend levels have been up and well see where things go from here but we certainly carry quite a bit of momentum into the marketplace and the purchase volume success ends up being giving a boost to the outstandings growth of capital one which of course like all the banks is still being constrained somewhat by the high payment rates but we were really happy to see that even the outstandings growth is the needle started to move there in the quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thats helpful just the other followup question i had has to do with how you think about not only the cost per account but the value of that account and how long it takes for that account to become at run rate i ask because you mentioned earlier how the competition is quite hot so you might someone might come away from this call thinking okay cost to acquire account is up but then the value of that account getting to full run rate levels how do you feel about that in this environment versus what youve seen in the past is that something that takes a to month timeframe or given where we are with the job growth inflation pickup all that is it possible that theres a longer tail on the value of the accounts that youre generating today thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so the time to pay back for any of the originations we do obviously is dependent on the particular segment but weve been investing for years in not just spending money on marketing but spending money on building the franchise of capital one and building a brand creating the really exceptional technology that powers the products that we have with customers creating exceptional customer experiences and i think what we are seeing is the continued benefit of our investment in the franchise capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 now we talked about leaning into marketing which we have been doing and as i said were continuing to do that we see good opportunities in the places weve been investing for years and while there is increasing competition we continue to see a good origination traction and a cost per account originated that is very reasonable for us by our historical standards and we really like everything we see about the early performance of the things that were booking so that would suggest betsy that the value of these accounts should be strong and so given all of this we see opportunity to continue as weve been going and keep a close eye on things that may change in the marketplace one segment at a time but for right now we think the opportunities are good and the return on the growing investment that we have had is good jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my questions this afternoon rich look youve been very clear about the opportunity generally speaking in terms of technology when we think about technology i think there are probably four places or four opportunities its product its customer experience its back office and its potentially underwriting and adding value there im curious when you think about those four factors or those four elements where you see the biggest opportunity to enhance return and are you seeing misuse of technology and people driving bad decisions or bad outcomes on any of these factors richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so hello rick and good evening all the areas that you mentioned are opportunity areas i think that the list is even more expansive than what you have but i certainly agree with the four because im looking at products customer experience back office and underwriting and let me just kind of think through some of the real opportunity areas for us importantly what i want to say is what im going to talk about here stands on the shoulders of our modern tech stack and were working to build breakthrough capabilities and solutions for example our new marketing platforms leverage big data streaming in real time to reach more customers with the right offers and driving to improve and optimize conversion rates our new credit decisioning platforms enable us to use way more data and more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to make better credit decisions our new fraud platform enables us to approve more transactions for our customers while simultaneously reducing fraud costs and just let me pause on fraud for a second because one thinks that while investing in fraud is really important of course to getting fraud costs down because fraud costs have continued to sort of rise in the industry but its also the opportunity having breakthroughs in the management of fraud creates an opportunity on the customer experience side and the business opportunities we have ill give you two examples one is in credit cards for very heavy spenders where the card always works is an incredibly important battle cry at the top of the marketplace and so the spillover benefits there are significant and also in building a national digital bank so if a bank just goes out there and hangs out its shingle and says come capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 on in and have folks sign up for digital bank accounts it turns out while fraud rates in the branches for people if they want to commit fraud dont typically walk into a branch to commit account opening fraud but its very easy to do that online so what we have found is that our heavy investment in fraud has been instrumental to our national banking strategy that you see featured on tv and the ability to really on a mass basis open up accounts nationwide and be comfortable with respect to the fraud cost so weve been talking about some of the risk management side of things let me also say just another key area not really directly on your list but sort of risk management beyond underwriting or fraud is as you know just banks the business risk management is the business and the ability to automate risk management process is the ability to move to monitoring all the time in real time of things that were otherwise just sampled theres just a lot of benefits that come from transforming how we work then to your customer experience category were building growing franchises in addition to the core card business and enhancing the experiences of our flagship cards were growing franchises with innovative products like capital one shopping and creditwise in the auto business were delivering innovative products like auto navigator which offers realtime underwriting of any car on any lot in america in a fraction of a second and enables customers to know in advance what their financing terms will be on any car before they visit the dealership and that was a little wordofmouth thing until we put it on national tv in the last few months im sure youve seen the ads were strengthening our brand and customer franchise evidenced by high net promoter scores and jd power naming capital one the leading mobile banking app i turn to the card partnership business were winning card partnership opportunities where increasingly retailers are focusing on digital capabilities as like a preemptively important part of the conversation were partnering with tech leaders like snowflake where we are their largest customer and in addition to getting valuable early investment stake in them weve been able to leverage the worlds leading data management platform for our own innovation on the operating side were steadily working to automate our operating processes enabling us to reduce risk and to reduce cost then theres the techontech savings our investments in modern technology are enabling us to reduce legacy tech costs and legacy vendor costs so again even as we invest more in modern tech were really powered by some of the benefits of reducing legacy tech costs digital productivity gains are powering speed to market and revenue generation and with all these growing opportunities were enjoying the virtuous cycle of attracting more and better tech talent which in turn accelerates our progress so even sort of beyond your list of four which is a great list our technology transformation is changing the trajectory of capital one in driving growth improving efficiency strengthening risk management enhancing the brand and improving our status as a leading destination for great talent capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 and so we like very much the position that were in here as ive said time frames are compressing in the industry and we want to make sure that we capitalize on those opportunities thanks for your question rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks rich operator well take our next question jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich i wanted to ask specifically about your highspending transactor business are you seeing evidence of the larger banks demonstrate demonstrating a willingness to go underwater on credit card rewards with the hope of driving engagement and winning business in other areas like wealth management and mortgage and if so how do you see these dynamics playing out across the industry in general and capital one in particular richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so the competition in rewards is certainly very intense we see it in the marketing levels everybodys stepping up for more of that the product structures and the overall rewards levels continue to be fairly aggressive and you can see banks out there refreshing products in the market recently with enhanced rewards and not only in the cash back space but also to your point at the very top of the market including with the high fee rewards card so i have not look i think we all live on pretty thin margin in thin transaction margins in this business really because whats happening and its great for consumers the leading banks have passed so many benefits onto consumers but what i would be surprised if our biggest competitors at the top of the market are losing money on every transaction and trying to make it up with volume elsewhere in their franchise there may be selected examples of that but i think what the leading players and this is certainly what weve been doing at capital one have invested for years in brand and digital capabilities customer experience the servicing side of things the card always works side of things to where one doesnt have to compete solely on the basis of rewards important though that is i think really for the top players i think this is really at the end of the day about building a franchise a sustainable franchise and i certainly from everything i see feel that thats what we have here at capital one capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 and i think a small number of players are particularly years of investing to get that position and i think all of us are wellserved by what we have jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good evening just on the expense side i know you indicated on the marketing side you expect a sequential quarter increase in the fourth quarter consistent with the historical trends if you look at it going back youre seeing anywhere between million to million linked quarter increase in the fourth quarter in marketing costs so just wanted to try to get an idea if you can maybe help us size that up and then one separate thing on the expense side the efficiency ratio longerterm implication of the it investment just wondering if theres any way to think about what that could interpret into in terms of an impact on the ratio on that operating ratio thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp john ill take the first question and then pass it over to rich for the second one as you note in the fourth quarter we typically have seasonal increase due to volumes and a number of i think you used the term sundry items and rich has talked about the investments that we are making on the technology side and compensation so i would think that not giving any sort of explicit guidance but i think if you look at history as your guide theres a lot in there that kind of would suggest where we might be going in the nearterm and rich talked about the investments over time and how thats going to play into the number of factors across the pl in terms of revenue growth and fraud and many other things that are playing down through there so thats how i would think about the short to mediumterm and ill turn it over to rich to answer your second question richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so john we declared years ago that through the tech transformation that we were driving which along the way was going to cost more to drive that that over time this transformation and the extra growth that we could get in the marketplace could that would put us in a good position to drive operating efficiency over the longer term and that that would be an important part of the investor value proposition for capital one and weve already seeing some significant improvements in operating efficiency i talked about the pressures that come from rising tech labor costs and the imperative to invest but while again the rising labor costs sort of by themselves dont really generate a lot of value they cost money the things were talking about here of leaning into investment opportunities are the very things that are part of our original strategic philosophy about driving operating efficiency that the way that we drive more growth over time the way that we drive more digital productivity gains will be to continue leaning into our tech transformation and the investment at the top of the tech stack for the in the growth opportunities that can help power that capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 so we are still allin on the quest the efficiency ratio quest and the kind of destinations that we have talked about we need to incorporate the investment imperative that we have along the way john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks and then on the credit front on delinquency trends just wanted to see if you can talk a little bit about if youre seeing any changes in the lower fico bands in terms of delinquency trends weve been seeing that at a couple of other players that theyre seeing some pressure on the lower fico and nonprime areas are you seeing anything there any evidence of upside pressure that would not be otherwise seasonally evident thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah john i think that most of what we see tends to be more in the range of normal but i would be the first to argue that subprime customers have certainly had a number of benefits in the marketplace that over time will and are going away so it would be a natural thing normalization is a very natural thing across the board it would certainly be a natural thing there we watch all these trends carefully what weve seen in both card and auto would really be in the category of both seasonal and normal but i wouldnt draw any big extrapolations from that just more of an observation of what we see at this point jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i guess i have one big picture question for rich obviously a big topic in the fintech world is embedded banking and how big tech companies might be the central hub for consumers rather than what currently might be the bank app i know youre making sizable investments to compete but do you think theres inevitability that behavior shift towards these aggregators richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so sanjay look that is a really great question and one that for many many years we have been we put a we have put your strategic question kind of front and center in our own thinking for years so ever since you could watch of course in china and the incredible way that inside tech apps ones whole life including financial life gets embedded in there thats the most extreme example of the frontend of banking really being taken over by a tech company and the risk of course as one looks at the marketplace to your point is the frontend of banking being taken over by tech companies and banks being the utilities quietly behind the scenes of that and that has been on central on our radar screen from for many years and we have seen and i think that there continues to be momentum in both camps so in terms of the tech companies being the frontend of capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 banking we see increasing traction in aggregation and many many types of aggregation not just people coming to go get a budgeting app kind of thing we see that oneoff aggregation for particular things and a whole variety of things in consumers life but between the incredible scale that tech companies have in terms of customers the incredible engagement they have and now the increasing traction in aggregation that is something that all of us need to really be staring at and i think there is in a sense kind of a great race going on between that model and the model of a bank being the goto place not only for the backend of banking but really for the frontend of banking where one can manage ones financial life through the technology of a customers bank and thats been a primary objective of ours for a long time and one of the probably reasons that weve worked so hard to transform our technology because we want to have shoulders to stand on that are the same shoulders as the leading tech companies have so that we can build software and have the kind of capability and speed to market and so on that comes from being a modern tech company and i have we have seen a lot of traction at capital one and i think some of the other leading banks have seen a lot of traction too i mean just looking at the growth of not only how many mobile customers that we have both online and mobile customers the growth rate of that but also the frequency of visits and the increasing number of things that we can do for our customers and the old world of banking was a reactive one customer would walk into a branch and say i have a particular need and then the banker would figure this out the opportunity that comes in the new world of technology is where proactive banking is as important as reactive banking theyre not proactive banking in the sense of spanning once customers with lots of crosssell offers but really banking where we are watching the customers money when the customer isnt and providing leverage right in the flow of the customers financial life to provide them the information that they need and the guidance that they need and if you notice some of the tv ads we did probably six to months ago were all about some of the realtime alerts that were helping people with things that they really they had no idea were going on with respect to their money so i think that the great race that you talk about is on its one of the reasons we feel a real imperative to invest but we like our position and i really like actually our chances to not just build some features and have a bunch of customers but actually to be at the center of our customers financial lives and to be able to really build a growing franchise where capital one is right there where the eyeballs are and where a customers mindshare is sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you just one quick followup for andrew on the nim obviously you saw a nice increase and you mentioned a number of different items but as we look ahead it would seem with the loan growth and the remixing theres probably tailwinds for the nim to the upside or how should we think about that us cards specifically thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp so sanjay youre touching on really the primary drivers so if youre looking just at card versus the corporate side there are kind of four factors i would call out that drove it in the quarter in card yield specifically rich talked capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 about the credit kind of benefits that are flowing through in suppression saw a tick up of delinquencies in the third quarter in line with seasonal trends but that aids late fees tend to have a fourth a third thing of seasonally higher revolve rates and then day count in the quarter are kind of the drivers of card yield so when i think about how those play out you can figure out which things are kind of seasonal to the quarter versus which things are driven by more macroeconomic factors versus what is sort of underlying trends ill pull up though and just give a corporate view of nim because you touched on some of the other dimensions that are really playing through more corporately which is the reduction of cash at the total company level and having that be replaced by card growth and then those factors coupled with the higher yield in card that i just described is really what benefited this quarter so as we look ahead continued normalization of cash continued growth in revolving card balances those are the things that would be tailwinds to nim but movements in the other direction things like sustained higher than normal payment rates or reduction in card yield would be headwinds so well just have to see how those things sort of net against one another jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much guys sanjay actually just asked my nim question so i have a question maybe diving deeper into the growth opportunities are you seeing is there a better arbitrage or better competitive opportunities in revolver versus transactor or is it subprime versus prime and maybe answer that both card and auto richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay john i dont see a particular segment that really stands out a strategic thing that weve been really leaning into for a number of years at capital one is a continued migration toward the transactor side of the business not running away from the other one but differentially really investing and enhancing that and of course when you see all the purchase volume growth and other things you can see the benefit there but what we have also found is that the real emphasis on the transacting side of the business even for revolvers ends up being something that not only generates more transactions but it helps drive a healthier prime and even subprime book so that quest is very alive and well at capital one we see growth opportunities really across the board theres pretty intense competition across the board but i think we see growth opportunities and a relatively rational marketplace in card across the board the auto business auto there are two things i would say about auto first of all theres like four or five planets that aligned in the auto business that i dont think in our lifetimes are going to align again that have led to some of the extreme performance thats happened in the auto business in terms of the growth the revenue the credit side of the business its been a very strong thing capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 given this strength we have particularly had a cautious eye looking at competitive pressures in that business and ive always said that the auto business is more subject to competitive pressure disrupting the business than the card business because the card business is oneonone us with a customer or a prospect the auto business again has the dealer in the middle of the whole exchange and the dealer is driving an auction and so we continue to be very carefully monitoring the competitive effects we are seeing growing competition in the auto business its showing up across the board from big banks credit unions and smaller independent lenders and were seeing it play out across all credit segments its showing up in pricing underwriting and loan terms and many lenders have expanded beyond their prepandemic credit box and as the competitive environment continues to evolve we remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategy and our core philosophy of maintaining high resilience and taking what the market gives us remained unchanged in our underwriting we make conservative assumptions and assume rapid normalization of vehicle values to more sustainable levels so theres kind of two competing things going on in the auto business that drives the results that you see one is growing competition which is very understandable because every auto player has posted really strong returns and wants to get more of that there are some signs that we raise an eyebrow to make sure that we see sound underwriting out there in the marketplace but we also have our opportunity is differentially being also powered by our tech capabilities that we have in the auto business things like auto navigator things like our relationship with the dealers and their reliance on our technology to help them underwrite better and sell cars more rapidly and effectively so the net of those two forces has led us to post another really solid quarter and were leaning in in the auto business but we should all understand we should be cautious about where the marketplace will go and also understand that the planet alignment at some point those planets wont be as aligned as they have been john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our last question this evening is from kevin barker with piper sandler please go ahead kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler companies good evening thanks for taking my questions just a followup on some of the competitive dynamics that you speak about especially for fintechs i mean have you considered possibly more radical change whether its acquiring the fintechs in order to accelerate your growth or your competitive position in the market or potentially trying to develop more radical efficiencies within capital one in order to spend to address the competitive environment within fintech capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2021 richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp sorry i was on mute there sorry for the silence thank you kevin for the good question there as we have said on a number of occasions the banking industry by the way scale matters a lot and by the way however important scale was years ago and by the way as someone that started capital one three decades ago and ive always worshipped on the altar of scale and its been a tough journey because we didnt have the scale for most of the time and one is always reminded of how more scale would help banks most of the banking industry is i think focusing a lot on buying other banks to build a very important scale at capital one we are not looking at bank acquisitions we are building a national i mean by the way we did four bank acquisitions in our past that were very important in putting us in a good position of threshold scale in the banking industry but where we are focused on the banking side is in building a national digital bank and thats really going to be an organic quest no company has ever really built one organically but we like where we are and we like our chances our acquisition focus is looking at technology companies and at fintechs and i mentioned both of those we have done acquisition of technology companies where they have some of the tech capabilities that were building and since we share a similar tech stack thats been a compatible thing to do and an accelerant and then of course we are looking at fintechs and capital one has done a number of those acquisitions in the past as well its not lost on us the breathtaking valuations that these companies command and so we want to be a patient investor but we are real students of the fintech marketplace because we can learn so much from them were inspired by some of the things they come up with and the things that they do and we partner with some of them take stakes in some of them and sometimes do acquisitions i think capital one is in ideal position as an acquirer of a fintech because of the tech stack that we have and pretty much every fintech out there every modern fintech out there is on the cloud and i think that the theyre on the cloud the tech talent they have is like very similar to our own culturally the whole thing the emphasis on data and analytics that is behind a number of the fintechs has been a focus of our company since its founding days so i think that we have some natural advantages on the acquiring side so for years weve looked at fintechs and occasionally made acquisitions and we certainly are pleased with the ones we have made jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp well i think that concludes our earnings call for this
