relatively strong despite the surge of covid cases in january and the war in ukraine on the whole our customers are in good shape and they remain cautiously optimistic about the future loan growth in the first quarter was solid and exceeded our expectations in several businesses compared to the first quarter last year general middle market average loans were up excluding ppp loans and large corporate loans were up credit quality remained very strong and expenses were wellcontrolled we are actively managing our balance sheet and remain wellpositioned for the rising rate environment overall the year is off to a good start highlighted on the slide are recent accomplishments associated with our corporate responsibility platform we are pleased with the progress we are making related to environmental sustainability climate risk is an emerging priority for all regulators and last month the sec released a notice of proposed rulemaking for climaterelated disclosures for the past years we have disclosed our progress in reducing our scope and greenhouse gas emissions discussing our goals in our annual corporate responsibility reports and providing annual responses to cdps climate change questionnaire comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 we will be publishing our corporate responsibility report in june through our membership and the partnership for carbon accounting financials or pcaf we have begun to develop estimates of our commercial lending portfolios financed emissions we expect to continue on this path and meet any reporting or regulatory requirements we look forward to keeping your apprised of our progress in light of the evolving postcovid environment we are taking a fresh look at our retail banking approach corporate facilities and technology platform these are areas that we are constantly evaluating but with the pace of change accelerating we are acting with even more urgency for example within our retail bank we continue to focus on transforming the delivery of our services aligning resources to best serve our customers and enhancing our small business focus also we are developing additional initiatives around optimizing our facilities for our employees the goal is to better accommodate flexible work arrangements reduce our footprint and improve efficiency while maximizing locations to best serve our customers as far as technology we are increasingly focused on ways to meet customers and colleagues rapidly increasing desire to utilize digital channels we believe these initials initiatives are essential and foundational to continuing to effectively execute our relationship banking strategy as we have for the past years turning to our first quarter results which are outlined on slide we generated earnings of per share solid broadbased loan growth momentum was partly offset by a large decrease in mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes and typical first quarter slower purchase volume as well as the continued wind down of ppp loans deposits in the first quarter are typically impacted by seasonality and this year was no exception following record activity in the fourth quarter net interest income benefited from loan growth as well as our larger securities portfolio as we work to deploy excess liquidity and lock in higher yields these benefits were offset by a million decline in ppp income strong credit quality resulted in a small reserve release as expected maintain the record levels of fee income we generated last year was challenging the first quarter was impacted by a large decline in warrantrelated income and negative returns from deferred compensation assets in addition we saw a seasonal decline in customer activity intensified by omicron in january we believe activity should be more robust as we move through the year expenses declined million and included the decrease in deferred comp and seasonality in several categories such as annual stock compensation overall companies are working on growing their businesses rebuilding inventory levels and increasing capital expenditures despite higher costs and labor shortages in general customers have been able to pass on price increases and their balance sheets are strong with excess liquidity despite some uncertainty customer sentiment remains positive which is reflected in our pipeline and growing loan commitment levels and now ill turn the call over to jim who will review the quarter in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide as curt just mentioned we had solid broadbased loan growth which was partly offset by an billion decline in mortgage banker and a million decrease in ppp loans loan commitments increased in most businesses and the line utilization rate held steady at about positive trends continued in general middle market and corporate banking which both grew over million excluding ppp general middle market comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 loans increased million or higher commodity prices and growing inventory levels are in part resulting in increasing working capital needs ma and capex are also drivers we continue to have great success in our equity funds services business where we provide capital call and subscription lines to venture capital and private equity firms the pipeline is strong and the activity remains high the increase in national dealer services loans included a small increase in floor plan loans which totaled a little over million and remains extraordinarily low relative to the typical historical run rate of about billion we expect it will take some time for inventory levels to rebuild as supply issues are resolved and pentup demand is satisfied environmental services continue to build on the strong growth weve seen over the past year opportunities are abundant and we continue to attract new relationships resulting in record loans and strong syndication activity mortgage banker declined significantly as refi activity slowed with higher rates and home sales fell to seasonal levels however we expect to see an increase in purchase activity as we enter the spring selling season also housing supply is expected to grow as we progress through the year we believe we are wellpositioned as of our mix is purchase related loan yields decreased basis points as the benefit from higher rates was more than offset by lower ppp revenue as the bulk of our portfolio is floating rate and largely reprices at the end of the month the full benefit of the recent rate increase is expected to be reflected in the second quarter as shown on slide average deposits declined in the first quarter mostly due to seasonality this follows record deposit growth in the fourth quarter when we had the highest quarteroverquarter growth rate amongst our peers deposits are up yearoveryear and we believe deposits will remain elevated but slowly decline as the fed increases interest rates and significantly shrinks its balance sheet the average cost of interestbearing deposits remained at an alltime low of basis points with the loantodeposit ratio for us and our peers at low levels we expect deposit rates to adjust slowly as rates rise slide provides details on our securities portfolio our goal is to prudently reduce our asset sensitivity as rates rise in part this can be achieved through deploying excess liquidity by opportunistically growing the securities book through the first quarter we purchased billion worth of securities with average yields of about basis points with recent purchases exceeding basis points a larger portfolio and to a lesser extent favorable new purchase yields resulted in a million increase in securities income holding balances and rates steady at the march level second quarter securities revenue would increase to about million we will continue to assess relative value between mbs and swaps as we execute our balance sheet hedging potentially leading to some incremental growth in the portfolio although likely at a reduced pace the rise in rates resulted in a marktomarket impact of million which runs through oci and affects our book value but not our regulatory capital ratios this accounting treatment does not capture the significant economic value created by higher rates on other parts of our balance sheet that are not marked such as deposits of note we typically hold the securities to maturity in which case the unrealized losses should be recouped turning to slide net interest income decreased million including a million decline in ppp income the net interest margin increased basis points mainly due to a decrease in excess liquidity as far as the details the decline in ppp income two fewer days in the quarter and lower nonaccrual activity together had a million impact this was partly offset by growth in nonppp loans which added million the benefit from higher rates was million and included a partial offset from lower rates on floors with the average rate on floors now at basis points floor has become less relevant as rates rise comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 as i mentioned the increase in the size of the securities portfolio at higher yields added million the decrease in balances at the fed reduced net interest income by million and added basis points to the margin fed deposits remain high at over billion and weighed heavily on the margin with an impact of basis points as far as credit which is outlined on slide our metrics remained excellent including net chargeoffs of only basis points gross chargeoffs declined while recoveries decreased from elevated levels of recent quarters criticized and nonaccrual loans remained low our provision was a credit of million sustained strong credit metrics and a continuing favorable economic forecasts albeit with elements of uncertainty resulted in a modest reduction in the allowance for credit losses to of loans through the cycles our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator with our consistent disciplined approach to credit we believe we could continue to outperform in the event we encounter a recessionary environment we are closely monitoring the portfolio looking for potential signs of stress from supply chain disruptions labor constraints and inflation overall our customers have been able to manage through these challenges performing well and maintaining their strong balance sheets noninterest income is outlined on slide warrantrelated income decreased million following elevated gains on monetizations in the fourth quarter in addition deferred comp which is offset in expenses decreased million to a negative million derivative income declined million due to a million change to the credit valuation adjustment mostly related to higher energy prices impacting our customers positions several customerrelated categories which reached record levels in the fourth quarter were challenged by seasonal factors market performance and a slower economic environment in january attributed to omicron this included a decline in commercial lending fees particularly syndications fiduciary income and card as curt mentioned we believe activity will improve as we progress through the year we continue to maintain our expense discipline as we position for the future growth as shown on slide total expenses decreased million in the quarter salaries and benefits decreased million including the million decrease in deferred comp which is offset in noninterest income performancebased incentives were lower as we reset targets to normal levels seasonal factors included annual stock comp higher payroll taxes and lower staff insurance of note our staff levels increased slightly as we are successfully retaining and attracting talent in a very competitive market occupancy and advertising were seasonally lower also legal expenses declined following elevated yearend activity lower outside processing is partly related to slower card activity and operational losses in fdic expenses which are difficult to predict were at elevated levels we kicked off certain initiatives related to modernization as curt described which increased expenses by million specifically related to consulting severance and asset impairment this is a journey which includes transformation of our retail banking delivery model alignment of corporate facilities and technology optimization we look forward to providing more information as these initiatives form the cost savings generated are expected to be reinvested as we continue to evolve as always our goal is to prudently manage expenses while enhancing our customers and colleagues experiences slide provides details on capital management loan and securities portfolio growth the impact from customer derivatives combined with share repurchases resulted in a decrease in our cet1 ratio to an estimated we continue to closely monitor loan trends and capital generation as we focus on our target as always our comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 priority is to use our capital to support our capitals and customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to shareholders slide provides an overview of our interest rate sensitivity and the benefit of the rising rate environment our standard model assumes a nonparallel rise in rates with a dynamic balance sheet based on the balance sheet as of march we estimate a million increase in annual net interest income over months as rates gradually rise basis points and the benefit will be slightly greater again in year two weve also provided various alternative scenarios for the purpose of providing an outlook for net interest income we added the expected 50basispoint rise in may using swaps and securities at march levels and our outlook for loan and deposit activity for the remainder of the year in this scenario we expect net interest income to increase by more than relative to and increase in the second quarter relative to the first quarter our outlook for is on slide and assumes the economy remains strong with gradual improvement of supply chain and labor challenges aside from the significant upside from rates our outlook for the full year is unchanged from our january earnings call there is no change in our expectation for broadbased average loan growth on a yearoveryear basis in the midsingledigit range excluding the decline in ppp loans this includes a decline in mortgage banker from the continued normalization of refi volumes and lower national dealer due to a slow rebound as a result of supply chain issues including ppp average loans yearoveryear are expected to be stable this outlook reflects our robust pipeline and positive momentum in many businesses relative to the first quarter we expect average loans to grow to each quarter with a seasonal pickup in mortgage banker along with growth in nearly every business line post the seasonal decline in the first quarter our base assumption is that deposits are expected to modestly decline for the remainder of the year with modest growth in wealth management and retail more than offset by a moderate decline in commercial deposits however the magnitude may be impacted by the pace of fed tightening and economic trends as these are major drivers for deposits i already reviewed our net interest income expectations but note that rate increases beyond may and the growth of our securities and swap portfolios present additional upside credit quality is expected to remain strong with net chargeoffs continuing to trend to the lower end of our normal basis points to basis points assuming sustained economic strength and the impacts from supply chain issues labor constraints and inflation remain manageable we expect criticized and nonaccrual loans to remain low as far as noninterest income there is no change to our outlook was the highest on record and the level of some categories are unlikely to repeat in such as warrantrelated activity derivative income including favorable cva stimulusrelated card fees and deferred compensation for the remainder of the year we expect significant broadbased growth in customerdriven fee categories as activity picks up this includes card deposit service charges commercial lending fees warrants as well as fiduciary which benefits from tax filings in the second quarter in addition deferred comp and securities gains and losses are difficult to predict therefore we assume will not repeat we continue to expect lowsingledigits increase in expenses second quarter expenses are expected to be relatively stable relative to the first quarter salary and benefits are expected to decrease modestly as the first quarter annual stock comp and lower payroll taxes are mostly offset by merit staff insurance and added staff as well as deferred comp outside of salaries and comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 benefits we expect higher advertising due to seasonality outside processing tied to revenue and technology expense to be mostly offset by lower operating losses we expect the tax rate to be to excluding discrete items and finally as i indicated on the previous slide we are focused in our cet1 target of as we monitor loan growth trends now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim as i said in my opening remarks many business lines are showing good momentum with increases in loans commitments and pipeline our credit culture continues to produce strong results and our expense discipline was evident as we continue to invest in products and services and make progress on our ongoing digital journey the nature of our business results in the balance sheet structure that quickly produces benefits from rising rates in the current rate environment we expect to continue to appropriately grow our securities and swap portfolios with a goal of providing more consistent earnings performance through the cycles our unique expertise in many areas as well as our geographic footprint offers significant growth opportunities im honored to work along such a talented and committed team we are wellpositioned as we move forward in thank you for your time and now wed be happy to take questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bill carcache from wolfe research your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning good morning curt you said that you expect fee income to be more robust as we move through the year can you discuss a little bit more on what gives you confidence in that and then maybe just a little bit more color more broadly on the optimism that youre hearing from your customers and what your sense is that that optimism is going to be enough to translate into continued loan growth curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ill ask maybe jim to talk about fee income and then maybe peter talk about optimism overall james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 great yeah and good morning bill yeah there are a couple of factors in play here first its important to remember that we are always seasonally lower in q1 it typically gets off to a lower start fewer days and just overall a little bit lower seasonal activity beyond that we had the added burden as i mentioned of omicron that we dont expect to repeat and of course we had significant impact from marketrelated fees i think it was about million just from market impacts on things like cva deferred comp warrant valuation so we had a lot of anomalous things going on in the first quarter we do expect all those to be removed as we move through the last three quarters of the year and get the normal seasonal pickup and you layer that on top of just some customer cautious optimism and we do think well see more activity in noninterest income as the year goes on maybe ill flip it over to peter for other comments peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah bill i would just add that to jims comment that probably even a little more than cautious optimism i think our customer base continues to perform really well we weve communicated to you guys that our pipelines are still above precovid levels and were seeing that in really across our footprint and just about every business line the outlook is pretty good i dont know that i can say that its as maybe robust as it was middle of last year but its still really strong and obviously theres a number of things going on in the economy that customers are being cautious about or prepared for but i dont know that i would say theyre pulling back at all i think theyre moving forward and we feel really good about where we sit and our ability to capture that bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you and if i may follow up with just one additional question your peers are assuming more rate hikes than the basis points that you have in your outlook was the objective there just to be conservative and that sort of along those lines on your interest rate sensitivity assumptions on slide it looks like your asset sensitivity came down a bit youve talked about reducing some of your asset sensitivity as rates rise is that something that like this is indicating youve started doing already or do you expect to wait a bit before more aggressively lowering your asset sensitivity thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah bill we very purposefully took down our asset sensitivity to a certain degree this quarter certainly deposits were a piece of that i had mentioned at the january earnings call that we did have some seasonal deposits that were inflating our asset sensitivity and so that piece was not a surprise but beyond that we did enter into a very significant level of ph fixed receive contracts billion worth of receive contracts made up of billion of offbalance sheet swaps billion of net securities once you account for the paydowns and so that was a pretty significant move it brings a lot of those rate hikes forward we are essentially taking basis points worth of receive fixed instruments making that a certainty by pulling it forward into the run rate for the time value of money and then in exchange for that we did give up about million of asset sensitivity most of the rest of that was deposits comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 so it has been a goal of ours to stabilize our net interest income take advantage of higher rates as they increase and thats exactly what were doing we feel really good about the progress we made this quarter and we continue to we expect to continue to do that as the quarters go on throughout the year bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning jon jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc im here sorry about that curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc okay no problem jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just one followup on that last question on hedging jim what is the longerterm goal or philosophy of the hedging what are you really trying to accomplish there james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc the ultimate goal is to smooth out our net interest income and asset sensitivity we dont like the feast or famine cycle that america had been in for really a number of cycles so our goal is to take advantage of the higher rates as they exist today to lock those in so that were protected from a risk standpoint when rates drop and the good news is were always going to leave a little bit of asset sensitivity on the table so the goal is to protect ourselves from a drop in rates take advantage of the rates that we see out there today lock them in bring them forward and still leave a little bit of asset sensitivity on the table we will likely have asset sensitivity in the lowsingledigit percentage area so i think were always going to benefit from rates rising but its important to us to lock in opportunistic rates like were seeing today and take advantage of putting those really in the income stream for the next several years so its a very balanced approach and we will do this gradually over the next several quarters certainly made a lot of progress this quarter and expect to make a lot of progress over the next several quarters jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 okay good thank you on that and then on the deposit beta question i last quarter you were asked a little bit about the likelihood of being closer to versus your standard model have you seen anything in terms of deposit pricing pressure or requests from your clients after this first hike and just curious on your thinking that we could be closer to deposit beta at least early on than the standard model james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah im going to offer some general comments then maybe ill flip it to peter for some customer color on that we still feel with all the liquidity in the economy that the first several hikes will be below well get closer to the as the subsequent hikes happen but we still feel pretty good about following the pattern of the last cycle the fed has gotten more hawkish since we talked in january on the earnings call so theres probably a little bit more pressure on that beta than i might have thought but it doesnt take us above for the first few so we still feel pretty good about a manageable beta in the short tomedium term but in terms of color from the customer side ill flip it to peter peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah jon and i think the other thing i would say is like everything that we do its very much relationshipfocused and so far that hasnt been a major point of conversation i suspect as we get further into the year it will be your in your larger businesses that are moving bigger deposits there might be a little more sensitivity to it just because of their access to other rates across the country but so far it hasnt been something that weve really faced as a big challenge but were prepared to talk about it and we know that itll be something as the year goes on well need to be upfront with our customers on jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore isi your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning appreciate all the guidance detail particularly around the fee trends and nii i guess putting it all together how should we think about the level of total revenue growth expectation for i know you gave some detail around nii of around up theres a lot of puts and takes there particularly on the fee side as we comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 were talking about so is it reasonable to assume perhaps a to revenue growth expectation for the year or could it be better than that thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah john number one starting with net interest income and maybe ill circle back to part of bills question that im not sure i answered fully we did offer some guidance we assumed the bps from march in our guidance we assumed the bps in may and i think the question bill had was are we being conservative do we not think those future rate hikes are going to happen that is absolutely not the case the rationale for our guidance being set the way it was is there is a wide range of opinions out there in terms of where fed hikes were going to go i think even amongst the estimates on the sellside analysts side theres a wide range of estimates so rather than try to pick one we thought it would be more hopeful to give the hikes that we know are happening for certain and then give you the model and you have the million for average bp hike or ph a point to point hundred you have the model for that that you can plug in you can apply the sensitivities that we have on the deposit betas that are on the slide so its a little bit of a plug and play so were trying to be helpful there in terms of giving you the certainty aspect of the beta hike and then you can put in as many hikes as you want and prorate it by that model that we provided in terms of revenue growth for the year i would bifurcate it between whats going to happen with net interest income and again theres a wide range of outcomes there in terms of fed hikes as well as what we might add on in terms of additional swaps and securities so just some tremendous upside there we know that noninterest income is going to be lower than we tried to make that as clear as possible if you look at some of the anomalous income we had in which i think is in the earnings materials whether it be stimulusrelated card fees cva and the derivative portfolio warrants we have about million of anomalous income that occurred in that will not occur in so we will have a negative percentage for relative to the noninterest income thats not new news at all i think weve been real clear on that noninterest income though has some tremendous capacity to create a very significant growth rate so just apply the modeling that we provided add as many swaps and securities as you think might make sense were certainly going to keep up a pace somewhat similar to what we had in the second or the in the first quarter we feel really good about revenue growth in but theres going to be a range of outcomes there depending on how many hikes you have john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks for that i guess another way to that i can maybe can go about asking is i guess also wanted to get your thoughts on the magnitude of positive operating leverage that you think you can achieve for given your lowsingledigit growth and expense expectation so fair to assume that you can achieve possibly to basis points of positive operating leverage or if you can help us think about that thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i would probably go back to the previous answer again a wide range of outcomes depending on hikes but its going to be a substantially favorable number so again we feel really good about it and it just depends how the interest rate environment goes throughout the year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay no ive got it thank you for that and one very quick last one i know you mentioned the floor plan portfolio increased from billion to billion i think on average just your expectation you think you can continue to see modest increases from here peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc john its peter i think the short answer to that is probably yes but very modest i mean were not expecting a huge recovery in floor plan we do feel like youre starting to see car assembly pick up youre starting to see some progress i think in the auto supply chain but i dont think thats going to translate floor plan balances just because the demand for cars is still so high and what we hear from our customers is theyre pretty much sold the moment theyre rolled off the truck and i think thats probably going to continue through the for sure the rest of this year maybe through the rest of next year quite candidly on some of the things that were hearing so we think well see a little bit if you look at a lot of the balanced growth that we saw it was mostly financing real estate were financing some ma activity because our customers are going to be on the winning side if you will of buying other dealerships and so thats what were really staying focused right now john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks for taking my questions peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yes operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ebrahim good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah good morning i guess just the first question around line utilization was wondering if you can elaborate why we didnt see a pickup weve heard from some of your peers whos observed a pickup or during the quarter driven by capital markets being tighter demand picking up capex et cetera would love any sort of thoughts around what you think needs to happen to see a meaningful pickup in line utilization from here and then just the outlook on the mortgage banker businesses then peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 yeah ebrahim its peter i think a little bit of its portfolio mix our overall corporate line utilization as we communicated was about flat but when you look at sort of our general middle market and our general businesses business banking us banking and so forth we did see a good increase there quarteroverquarter so were starting to see some utilization i wouldnt say its back to historic levels but we did see a little bit of utilization so i think the difference you might be seeing there is mostly portfolio mix its a good segue to your question on mortgage mortgage saw a big drop in utilization in the quarter and i think our outlook there is still positive theres not anything per se that isnt normal seasonality that weve seen and we still feel really good about the mortgage business and i think as the year unfolds youll continue to see ive tried to communicate to you all that on if you look at that quarterly chart in the appendix its up into the right over a long period of time and were focused on adding new customers and increasing that overall warehouse lines that we have out and we think well be able to continue to do that so our we do think though yearoveryear youll we will be down as weve communicated in mortgage banker ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and do you also expect the mortgage banker spreads to narrow as well so even though its a liborbased book given the market backdrop you see spreads coming down so thats going to impact how that reprices peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc ebrahim i think youre asking me about pricing in mortgage in general and i guess my answer to that question is is we do think its getting its more competitive in mortgage banker than it was kind of right when the pandemic started so theres probably a little bit of pricing pressure there but nothing that were not used to in all of our businesses ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one quick indiscernible sorry for going back to this i understand there are like wide options indiscernible but do you have a number in terms of what nii would look like if you just assume that the forward curve plays out as expected and where nii will would land in that backdrop james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc ebrahim yeah we have played with a number of scenarios but at this point again there are so many potential permeations that i think for now were going to hold to the bp guidance that weve offered and just offer the model and let people plug that in ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 thank you operator our next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for hey just wanted to ask a question on deposit balances is your feeling i know you expect modest declines through the remainder of the year visàvis the first quarter but will the first quarter have been sort of the worst of the deposit contraction in your view james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc oh it absolutely will be the worst scott we had a lot of seasonality that occurred as we mentioned some of those structural things cyclical things related to fed movements has not really kicked in yet and that will pressure us probably with our business model and our heavy dependence on commercial deposits we will be impacted probably a little bit more than other banks but we dont expect for any one quarter that impact to be nearly as impactful as the seasonal runoff that we saw in the first quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you and then indiscernible peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc fourth quarter being a record r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah yes understood thank you and then maybe a followup just regarding rate sensitivity can you speak qualitatively to your preference for adding securities versus swaps in moderating your rate sensitivity james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah we always look at relative value between the two thats certainly a factor we also look at capital implications some securities come with capital you need to hold against them so thats a factor and that factors into the overall pricing comparison and relative value between the two of them and then of course liquidity levels our cash levels are coming down and that will probably make us a little more cautious about adding securities going forward so we have been adding an abundant amount of both over the last couple quarters and certainly we stepped it up a lot in the first quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 i do think as the quarters go on youll see fewer and fewer securities added and more and more swaps in terms of the proportion but they both have their advantages on a relative value basis one can look better than the other at times and so well utilize both going forward but i think youll see us continue to pivot a little bit more towards offbalance sheet swaps as opposed to onbalance sheet securities r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes okay perfect thank you very much james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc morning i wanted to start on the rate sensitivity i know youve been very clear you have a goal to reduce asset sensitivity but whats the thought on adding all the swaps here why not wait until rates go up before trimming the asset sensitivity because it just feels like youre leaving a lot of economic benefit on the table by doing so much right now james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc hey good morning steve yeah we do not want to pick our point where we think rates are going to peak we saw a little bit of that in the last cycle and thats not something were interested in doing again i think its really important to mention that we are just getting started we have a lot of swaps a lot of interest sensitivity still on the table we will be taking advantage of these rates over the next several quarters we have quite a ways to go so i wouldnt necessarily think about it in terms of we put our stake in the sand in the first quarter of thats by no means the case we are going to try to avoid picking where we think rates are going to peak were going to stay methodical as ive said in the past and we have a long ways to go comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 and by the way even when were done were going to leave some asset sensitivity on the table and will still benefit from higher rates so wed like to have our cake and eat it too to a certain extent were adding significant amounts of income to the run rate now but we have a lot further to go in terms of adding swaps and as rates go up if were fortunate enough that they do go up continuously over the next year we will certainly be in a position to take advantage of that curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim i might just add a little color this is curt a little color commentary and sort of our thinking here so we live through close to an or 10year cycle of near zero interest rates beginning with the financial crisis which was really challenging for us on the revenue side of the house and so when we saw rates increasing in and we were a little bit more probably focused on picking a higher point in terms of where the rate cycle might go and we made some progress on hedging but not nearly enough and we saw the dramatic decrease in rates going to zero as the covid crisis began so we lived through one of those cycles and were just trying to be prudent theres going to be no change to our model we are primarily a commercial bank so no matter what as we add more loans and customer relationships were always going to be assetsensitive as an organization and probably highly assetsensitive relative to some in our peer group but we want to make sure were dollar cost averaging here if you think about your stock portfolio and that were adding appropriately hedges to the portfolio throughout the cycle were all assuming continued rate increases but we also werent assuming covid we werent assuming a ukrainian war theres a lot that no matter what could derail a scenario and so were just trying to be prudent and sort of solidifying our revenue stream on a goforward basis not just for a shortterm cycle but over several years going forward james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah and i might add to that there are really two components of leveling out the asset sensitivity theres a risk control aspect and theres a profit maximization aspect and steve i think youre thinking of the profit maximization aspect as many equity analysts would there is a risk control stamp or aspect to this and that we want to make sure that if things do go south that we can be as confident as we can be in protecting that common dividend which was not a sure thing back when rates were zero and we were having credit pressures we want to make sure that from a credit rating agency standpoint were always in good stead with the customer base we have we think our credit rating is extremely important our customers value that so i feel like a lot of the wood that weve chopped so far is really taking care of that risk control aspect that to some extent weve secured the dividend weve done those things to make sure that we can withstand a downturn if rates were to go the other direction and as rates continue to go higher i think wed start transitioning from the risk control aspect to more of the profit maximization so really a couple objectives there that were trying to check the box on steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats very helpful color actually so for curt in your prepared comments when you talk about modernization efforts and you indicated a greater sense of urgency is the message to the market that there could comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 be more spin coming from the company at some point or are you simply saying that you recognize that to be competitive and improve the client experience you need to take modernization to the next level curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc steve its a little bit of both i just think over the last months the whole world the whole corporate america has learned a lot and i really think as a ceo of a company whether youre a bank or a nonbank youve got to be thinking about sort of the operating model in a postcovid world and so the way i think you should think about this is that its really a continuation of a path that weve been on for some time and were finding ways to accelerate our progress in terms of our retail branch delivery and sort of the customer experience there continued investment in digital and in our real estate footprint and i can go into detail on all of those but on the retail side weve been a very good steward of over time trimming our network there we operate a fairly thin branch franchise today but we think weve got some opportunities to continue to look selectively at locations and those would sort of bleed out over future quarters as we have opportunities there and were just looking at sort of our model around branch delivery to make sure its as efficient as it possibly can be with really the goal of always doing a good job of the customer experience but also enabling our colleagues with digital delivery etcetera and on the real estate side weve done a very good job there weve reduced our real estate footprint in the last really since about to but with all these flexible work arrangements being more accommodative to the new world of balancing work from home and work from the office we think theres opportunities there to continue to rationalize some of our real estate but also create space that we think is very attractive to our employees and accommodate some more collaborative sort of open floor plan and technology is an ongoing journey a lot of the savings that we realized through those two initiatives which are sort of heavy real estate focused were going to continue to invest in digital the reason were pointing this out to you is we did have some charges in the quarter that we called out they were fairly modest we anticipate as we think about these things we havent yet decided all of them that we may in subsequent quarters have some additional charges and im going to let jim add some additional color there james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i think of this in a couple aspects were going to have what i call some exit and transitional charges of which you saw million in the first quarter and youll see some additional charges in subsequent quarters some will be smaller than the million some will larger those would not be in our outlook since theyre not even formed yet but i do think of those as exit and transitional charges we talked about asset impairments and severance in this most recent million to the extent we actually have investment in our applications in our core product suite those are not the types of things that i think is something we would call out we try to selffund those as much as we can i think about those in terms of our normal investment portfolio that we do each year on the technology side as well as just any normal evergreening of facilities and banking centers and so well manage it really from two aspects and well probably report it as such we certainly will call out the exit and transitional cost that occur but we will attempt to selffund many of the investments in this on the pure product side as we can but more to come and of course these are still forming comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc appreciate all the color thank for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi thanks hi good morning all i want to go back to page in the deck and the projected swap benefit as of so can you just help us understand like is that marked at a certain libor rate and then thatll change as libor goes up that slide or are you just locked in knowing that that chart and the expected contribution is sticky and will carry with you through this period that you show on the lowerright chart thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning ken yeah those benefits are based on libor rates and bsby rates as of the end of march and so to the extent you get a rise in those rates you will bring in less income or recognize less income on the swaps of course you more than make that up many times over on the loan side and the impact of both of those are already forwarded into the modeling that we have on the bottomleft side of that page so it is all accounted for ken usdin q analyst jefferies company right okay got it and so moving to that then can you remind us then can you walk us through just the percentage of the book thats tied to the various libor rates whether one month three months six months prime etcetera if theres a general way that you can help us with that thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah well if you turn to slide of course we do split out the 60day rates versus 30day rates ken usdin q analyst jefferies company right james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 the 60day plus as well as the 30day the vast majority of our focus is still on libor because we didnt start making bsby and sofr loans until january so we started really the momentum right as the year was ending in but at this point the vast majority is still libor we do turn our book over every two years to three years so you can kind of prorate that to get a feel for the rate at which bsby and sofr would start to replace the libor loans ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it yes forgot about that chart thank you for the reminder and then last one just on the your comments about your belief that a low beta you said 10ish or so for the first couple hikes whats your line of sight on how long the betas could stay that low and how do you look at that just in is that in the second quarter guidance how far out do you have a line of sight on the beta staying that low thanks guys james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah ken id mentioned that in the first few hikes of the last cycle it was really the first five we stayed below a beta for each of those and so thats still our kind of base case at this point that we will stay below for the first five and the guidance that we offered in the outlook that takes that into account that does have a somewhat moderate beta in it so that is accounted for ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of jennifer demba from truist securities your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning question on asset quality it remains excellent you had another negative provision in the quarter how much longer can we see negative provisions in this environment where its a bit more uncertain as rates are going up so fast and we have obviously more geopolitical risk melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc good morning jennifer this is melinda its really difficult to predict under the cecl methodology exactly whats going to happen with provision but suffice it to say as was already mentioned i mean we feel really good about the underlying quality of the portfolio assuming that the economic environment stays relatively positive and stable you know it is possible given that cecl is still new we dont really know where the bottom is it is possible that we could have very modest levels of provision negative provision and then stabilizing we expect chargeoffs as jim and curt mentioned to sort of stabilize to the low end of our normal range although asset quality again is excellent right now it is not sustainable in the long run i mean we are a commercial bank we comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 lend money and customers have challenges and theres a lot of economic uncertainty right now just given all the inflationary pressure so we saw just a little bit of migration in the first quarter in terms of our criticized assets nothing that would lead us to be concerned about any particular portfolio but we continue to watch those portfolios that are more sensitive to just the general economic challenges so possible to have a negative provision small negative provision for a couple of quarters but very very difficult to predict specifically jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc which portfolios do you feel are most vulnerable with the rising rate environment at comerica melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc certainly our leverage portfolio i mean obviously given the amount of leverage that they have they are very sensitive to interest rate increases we do sensitize that portfolio when we underwrite initially and again our leverage portfolio is really part of our middle market kind of core ci relationship strategy so we underwrite strong companies and management teams and have a lot of confidence that theyll be able to manage through that but that book is kind of the tip of the spear for credit quality concerns and we continue to watch that one closely automotive the supplier base has obviously been challenged given the chip shortage plus you add on to that all the other uncertainty around the inflationary pressures but its a relatively small book compared to the total and we have many many decades of experience in that automotive supplier base and they have managed through many many cycles successfully so those are the two portfolios id say that we are watching most closely and then small business obviously they have less pricing capability in terms of just all the inflationary pressures less ability to pass that on so that book has held up incredibly well it has good liquidity but we have less visibility into a small customer versus some of our larger customers so were watching that one as well jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of peter winter from wedbush securities your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 thanks good morning curt i was just curious about if there are any plans to manage the available for sale securities portfolio in a rising rate environment and any thoughts on maybe moving it to held to maturity or hedging it especially as soon as i think jim you said that you hold the available for sale to maturity anyway james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning peter yeah we have absolutely no plans to move any of that to htm and really we discount the entire aoci discussion i know it does have an impact on tangible book book value per share i know thats a bit of an optic but i think when you look through the true economics which i think everyone should if you look at other parts of our balance sheet that are not marked in particular deposits as i mentioned we benefit so much economically from an economic value of the franchise from rising rates that we are not concerned about a single line item being marked down and what that does to tangible book we think the real economic value needs to be looked at and we think its just a bit of window dressing to put it in the hold to maturity so certainly no plans there peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then just on energy its under i guess of the loans now is there an interest in growing this portfolio just like id feel like underwriting standards are much stronger loan spreads are better just due to less competition peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc peter this is peter i think the we are focused on continuing to be an energy bank we feel really good about our energy portfolio that we have today i dont know that were going to return to the levels that you saw five years or six years ago as far as the percentage of the portfolio we did see a little increase this quarter but not a lot so its a business that weve been in for a long long time we plan to stay in it but i dont think itll get to the size that it was like i said probably five years or six years ago we feel real good about the level that were at and plan to maintain that peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning just wanted to revisit the size of the balance sheet for a moment combining the comments you made on the tempering of the securities growth the cash normalization process and deposit growth just taking a step back how do we think about nearterm earning assets relative to the million ph million this quarter how do we think about the cadence of that in the next couple quarters james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning chris we do think that to some extent we will see temp investments go down and loans will eat in to some of that but the bottom line is deposits are also going to decrease and that will probably be what really moves the balance sheet so we will see a very modest reduction in earning assets to the extent deposits go down that shrinks the overall size of the balance sheet but therell be some moving parts there definitely go in both directions christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but just to reiterate the drop that we saw this quarter were talking much more manageable declines in earning assets james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc much more manageable yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then from there later in the year is there a as you kind of look to next year would you expect this trend to reverse as deposit growth resets with the fed doing in that regard james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc you know the fed is going to stay active probably for a couple years we dont expect their balance sheet to return to the level the feds likely to target until about rate increases will probably go through at least part of and of course sometimes customers react on a bit of a lag so i think youll see deposits kind of languish just slightly down from where theyre at now probably over the next couple years is our best guess but theres no exact equation for this there are so many moving parts in the economy with money supply that its hard to say but certainly the fed actions will cast a shadow over deposit growth and those will continue over the next couple years most likely christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then if i could just squeeze one more the buyback is seemingly reaching the end as youve achieved your capital target is there anything to speak of in terms of inorganic capital use ma comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah no new information there chris we continue to be very focused on organic growth and are having a lot of good success both in our legacy franchise but also in examples like our expansion into the southeast into north carolina as we set up commercial loan offices there and have now added wealth management capabilities we envision eventually adding a retail bank there as well down the road weve added some staff in our denver office as well in the middle market side and so weve got really good opportunities in our existing franchise still in some of the best markets in the united states in terms of major metro markets especially in texas and california then michigan is doing well also and then weve been able to parlay that into expansion into other markets as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking the questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gary tenner from da davidson your line is open gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning i just had a followup on the acl question im just wondering as you work through the first quarter and your cecl model have you made any active changes to your probability weightings in terms of kind of recession risks gdp growth etcetera and any detail you could provide on that melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah gary this is melinda the economic forecast that we selected in the first quarter was relatively consistent with the economic forecast in the fourth quarter and the way we approach that economic uncertainty is to look at certain portfolios and then stress them to a higher recessionary scenario which we did and so we used a more severe recessionary forecast for a portion of the portfolio to add to the qualitative reserves to come up with again that kind of small release number that we had this quarter gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you for that and just one more followup just on aoci question that peter had asked that your point is well taken in terms of it being kind of a timing issue and temporary but in terms of weve still seen obviously the value of the curve rates move higher here over the first month of the second quarter can you give any color in terms of the sensitivity of aoci to additional moves from here obviously the base that theyre moving up from is higher than it was from yearend in comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah gary in our modeling its not a lot different from what weve seen we saw kind of that medium part of the curve where securities were move about bps over the last couple quarters and we took that close to billion hit to aoci its about the same sensitivity so bps would generate about billion of hit or million for every bp and its somewhat linear so kind of in that ballpark gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian foran from autonomous your line is open brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hi i definitely appreciate the comments that everyone is making different assumptions on rates and you guys dont want to be creating point estimates but just coming back to your plugandplay comment i mean if im trying to work that to what it seems like the central case of the market that maybe the fed has to go to or this year i mean is the plug and play as simple as your guidance implies billion of nii this year theres no rate benefit really in the first quarter so thats more like billion on a run rate and then if i throw in million that gets me close to on fed funds and maybe throw in a little bit more than that if the fed goes to or so its like if im working back to that central case of the market of the fixed income market at least of a to fed funds rate is like a billion nii at least using your plug and play correctly or i guess its hard for you to bless that i guess but maybe its like the fed you can issue a nonobjection to make sure indiscernible james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah the model is pretty linear and its not going to change a lot as rates continue to move higher from an exact modeling standpoint i just remind you as i mentioned in the script that most of our floating rate loans reset at the end of the month following a rate hike so youd want to get that right in terms of your quarterly impact assumptions but it is pretty linear along the lines of what youre describing and what the graph shows brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp and then the added challenge is again if i believe the fixed income market im supposed to be maybe modeling some cuts in so i think you said by the time this process is done youd like asset sensitivity to be in the lowsingledigit range so is the just logical implication that next time around if and when the fed cuts were talking like million adjustment to nii not like the much bigger numbers we would have seen historically comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc that is exactly the goal brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and then maybe if i could squeeze in the last one i mean just trying to translate all this to like a normalized earnings power if you want to just give me normalized eps that would be great but no credit is the other big swing factor can you just remind us what do you think is a reasonable either point estimate for chargeoffs or a range i know its tricky because youre always commercial books are rarely at normalized chargeoffs theyre either theyre on trough for a long time and then theyre briefly at a peak but as you think about through the cycle credit costs what kind of range of chargeoffs do you plug in melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda i think as curt or jim already mentioned i mean we do expect these extremely low levels of chargeoffs to continue to normalize and we would guide towards the low end of our kind of normal range of basis points to basis points would be what we would expect brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp great i appreciate it thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you brian operator our next question comes from the line of steve moss from b riley securities your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning i just want to ask a little further on balance sheet position here with higher rates obviously a pretty big markdown on the securities book just kind of curious is there an aoci mark that could cause you to stop securities purchases and then the other part here just kind of thinking about what is the percentage of cash to assets maybe just thinking of it as a ratio that you guys want to hold going forward james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc all right good morning steve thanks for the question yeah to your first question we are not concerned about the aoci impact so there is no level that would cause us to not buy securities or do something different were very focused on the economics just as we think everybody else should be comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 im sorry whats the second question steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc just i think you said youre going to focus more on probably more swaps less securities going forward just kind of curious whats the percentage of cash you seek to hold yeah james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc oh the cash yeah yeah weve always targeted because we do have a commercial base thats a little bit lumpy and we can see some larger ins and outs out of our cash position perhaps relative to some pure banks we typically like to hold billion to billion worth of cash used to be our own benchmark first of all look at the changes in the environment as we come into the next cycle and the options were tapped into funding on a very expedient basis sometimes well move that number up or down just depending on our access to funding but kind of in that billion maybe billion to billion range is kind of the level of cash we like to hold steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great thank you very much i appreciate all the color james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks for the question operator our next question comes from the line of michael rose from raymond james your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning michael michael rose q analyst raymond james financial inc hey hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to hit on the technology and life science business it looks like the average loans hit an inflection point this quarter so i just wanted to get the outlook there and then on the equity fund services obviously good qonq growth and the outlook i think for the venture capital association is still pretty robust so just any sort of color there on outlook would be great thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah michael its peter both of those are businesses that we want to continue to invest in that were wanting to add resources to the tls business is one that youre right it did feel like it hit an inflection point maybe this quarter and were seeing really good volume there and feel like weve got an opportunity to continue to grow that on the ph efs side i would say the same thing both of those businesses the outlook feels really good and the pipeline activity is really good and across the country were finding opportunities to add people or comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 pick up people it is extremely competitive in the tls business i would tell you a number of banks i think are wanting to get into it weve been in it for a long long time and i think were in a great position to capture what feels like a growth business so yeah thanks for asking about both of those we feel real good about the outlook on each michael rose q analyst raymond james financial inc great thanks for taking my question peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah operator our next question comes from the line of ryan nash from goldman sachs your line is open curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning curt good morning jim jim maybe just a couple of followups on the asset sensitivity on the back of ken and brians question so on slide can you maybe just talk about what the received rate was on the swaps that you added and jim maybe more just philosophically can you maybe just talk about what youre looking at to trigger additions to the swaps is there a minimum received fix level that youre looking at based on your view of the rate environment is there a set notional amount we should expect you to be adding on a quarterly basis to reduce the sensitivity im just trying to think about mechanically how youre going to do this given that i think on our math you need to add another billion to billion of swaps im just curious on the received rate and how you think about adding over the next couple of quarters james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc hey good morning ryan the ones we added in the first quarter the gross received rate was just a tad over very close to and of course we paid bsby which is actually running below libor at this point so that would be give you a perspective for the rates in terms of the volume i would go back to my more global comments that were looking at this holistically in terms of what are the securities options on the balance sheet what are the swap options off the balance sheet and as i mentioned we will likely sort of pivoting more towards the swaps if you look at what we did with securities and swaps in the first quarter at billion on a net basis and thats a pretty stepup pace i dont know if well run quite at that pace every quarter it will depend on market conditions but well certainly be running close to that for the next couple of quarters and you will see more of a pivot towards swaps i suspect over the next couple quarters ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then just on your followup for the modest decline in deposits just given the pace of rate hikes that were expecting over the next couple of quarters how are you thinking about the mix of deposits youre currently comerica inc cma corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2022 in the mid on noninterest bearing and i think last cycle as we got to basis points or so we started to see deposits look for a little bit more rate on what they were receiving so im just curious what are you assuming for mix shift over the course of the next couple of quarters james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah i think to the extent we lose deposits it will be disproportionately to noninterest bearing i think even beyond that we will likely see a modest shift each rate hike from noninterest bearing to interest bearing thats just natural we saw it go the other direction as rates were going down customers just became less rate sensitive so we will see a gradual remix of that portfolio towards interestbearing over time ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc having just said that that just having said that our portfolio is so heavy on the commercial banking side in our deposit mix and so much of that is operating funds for businesses and companies that we work with were always going to have a high noninterestbearing component probably relative to our peer group even though we see some mix shift occurring james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah yeah thats actually part of the value of the business model here at comerica having treasury management services and theyre certainly a foundational piece in terms of operational deposits ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks again james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you ryan operator ill now turn the call back over to curt farmer president chairman and ceo please go ahead curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc as always thank you for your
