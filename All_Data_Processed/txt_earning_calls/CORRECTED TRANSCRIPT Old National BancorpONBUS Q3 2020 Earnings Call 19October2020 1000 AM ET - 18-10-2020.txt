this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy we are pleased with our third quarter results as we made significant progress on client deferrals we improved our operating leverage and grew the loan portfolio and ended the quarter with a robust commercial pipeline old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 we remain committed to focus on the health and safety of our team members clients and communities we are currently occupying about of our office buildings by rotating team members every four weeks our branch lobbies are open and we are active in our communities many larger banks have told their relationship managers to stay home and not worry about goals this year by contrast our relationship managers are proactively serving existing clients and winning new relationships rather than being distracted or derailed by covid jim sandgren and i have also been actively calling our new client opportunities to help win business ive been impressed by the quality of the new relationships weve been able to win this quarter many of them moving from longterm relationships from other larger banks i would like to thank our team members for their hard work and dedication starting on slide our third quarter net income was million or per share i was particularly pleased with our progress on operating leverage and strong balance sheet growth growing our balance sheet and watching our cost should help us mitigate the nearzero interest rate environment while we did not take a provision this quarter we did grow the reserve given our net recoveries for the quarter brendon will fill you in on all the details with respect to our reserve end of period commercial loans increased by annualized primarily due to the record commercial production our commercial production was million up from million in the second quarter line utilization was about the same core deposits were higher by on annualized basis driven by continued growth in noninterestbearing deposits net interest income was unchanged but the margin was lower from the effect of new business yields mortgage and capital markets revenue continued to be exceptionally strong and offset covidrelated lower deposit service charges we continue to achieve lower expenses as we execute on our onb way initiatives our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was yearoveryear operating leverage were improved by almost basis points when we introduced the onb way i told you i was more excited about the revenue initiatives than the cost initiatives many of these revenue initiatives have been delayed because of the pandemic but we are now making progress on building systems and hiring talent to support these initiatives im excited about the team members weve already hired and the ones we have in the pipeline we have a great story to tell and we have strong interest from senior relationship managers from other larger institutions we have hired and expect to hire more in wealth management private banking commercial treasury management and key support team members in it and digital marketing these hires will put nearterm pressure on personnel costs over the next few quarters but will ultimately lead to higher revenue from these growth initiatives most of our reported credit quality metrics are relatively unchanged during the quarter but we expect that credit metrics will ultimately worsen and losses will materialize once the stimulus and deferral programs run their course we proactively downgraded some of our most vulnerable loans into the watch asset quality ratings and are meeting weekly to review credit quality loanbyloan we still dont know when losses will meaningfully materialize but we suspect sometime in the first half of next year depending on additional government stimulus programs we believe our historically strong underwriting practices our diverse and granular loan portfolios and midwest footprint should help us weather the impact better than most we continue to share with our board of directors multiple economic forecasts and various stress tests as a result we dont anticipate any capital actions and we expect to maintain our current dividend old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 on last quarters call i stated we are open for business and are extending new credit old national has always managed with a longterm view we will continue to make new loans if were comfortable with the underlying cash flow structure and pricing the loans we are booking today are generally with better structures than we would have accepted last year we do not jump into businesses or sectors during the good times only to exit during the tough times our balance sheet and capital remain strong our markets are diversed and our experienced team will help us manage this uncertain time speaking of experience i will turn the call over to our 41year tenured team member mr daryl moore daryl d moore chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp great thank you jim first update wed like to provide this morning relates to our client relief programs with respect to deferrals we have previously reported that we granted some type of deferral on roughly billion in loans which represented roughly of the portfolio at the end of this most recent quarter the dollar amount of loans still in deferral mode had dropped to million which represents approximately of the total portfolio in the commercial area requests for deferrals have effectively dried up and weve taken the position that any applications for future deferrals that would result in total aggregate deferment period in excess of days would be granted only in the most unusual of circumstances on the retail side while we continue to receive both new deferral requests and requests for renewal extensions the volume of those requests has fallen significantly while we attempt to hold aggregate deferral periods to days in this portfolio as well we are a bit more lenient with individual borrowers when the cause of their financial issues is clearly covidrelated as you know we were very successful in securing ppp funds for our clients having originated just short of loans with balances in excess of billion the recent announcement by the sba of a streamlined forgiveness process for loans of or less is good news for many of our clients who received ppp funds in that roughly or of the ppp loans we helped facilitate fall into the streamlined forgiveness category todate weve submitted over loans to the sba for forgiveness representing million in outstanding balances remaining fees on ppp loans not yet taken into income totaled million slide sets out those industries that many across the banking landscape feel are most vulnerable to our current economic conditions there has been little change in our exposure to these industries which remains at only roughly of total loans while there is a merit in acknowledging that these industries as a whole may be suffering disproportionately in the current environment it is important to note that not all of the borrowers in these categories are experiencing difficulties with some even doing well the chart at the bottom of slide shows the breakout of our consumer portfolio along with corresponding average fico scores this portfolio has shown little change as well since our last presentation to you that having been said we are watching this portfolio closely with future labor market trends uncertain and deferments expiring consumer portfolios could come under increased stress in the coming quarters slide lays out trends in the most significant credit indicators delinquency rose in the quarter slightly to basis points of the total portfolio with the increase in delinquency rates wholly attributable to the retail lending portfolio this increase in retail loan delinquencies was not unexpected given the level of retail loans on deferment at the end of the second quarter that were subsequently required to resume their payments by september old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 with respect to chargeoffs in an ironic twist of fate we posted a net recovery in the current quarter in large part due to recovery of the writedowns we took back in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of on a pharmarelated project this particular project became much more valuable given its intended use in the covid vaccination process nonperforming loans increased in the quarter as was expected the increase in the current quarter came about in great part through the downgraded relationships that had shown weaknesses prior to the pandemic as well as from the hotel segment that as we all know experienced sudden and deep troubles early on in the pandemic further downgrades into the nonperforming category are certainly a strong possibility with the pace and magnitude dependent in some part on the continued impact of the pandemic and the ability of congress to come to an agreement on additional fiscal stimulus one final comment id like to make is around the loan growth in the quarter while we have given direction to our underwriters to be mindful of current economic conditions weve also asked them to keep in mind more intermediate and longterm factors as they evaluate credit requests requests from borrowers with balance sheet and liquidity staying power are viewed as opportunities and not discouraged from consideration if they meet our lending standards which have always been intended to live through economic cycles with that ill turn the call over to brendon brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you daryl before turning to the quarterly financials we would like to provide an overview of our allowance for credit losses our cecl model assumptions were again derived from the moodys baseline forecast which included meaningful improvements in both gdp growth and unemployment trends increasing reserve needs driven by improving current and expected economic conditions was more than offset by an increase in our qualitative reserve although this economic recovery appears to have garnered some traction downside risks remain elevated and believe it is premature to release reserves until we have more clarity on the path of the virus and future government action our current acl to loan ratio including ppp loans stands at basis points excluding ppp balances our allowance to loan ratio would be basis points wed also like to remind you that we continue to carry million in unamortized marks from our acquired portfolio while these marks will not directly offset chargeoffs any remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution turning to the quarter on slide our gaap earnings per share was and our adjusted earnings per share was adjusted earnings exclude million in onb way related charges as well as million in debt securities gains moving to slide we are pleased with our quarterly adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue which was higher yearoveryear and higher over prior quarter this improvement was driven by commercial loan growth strong mortgage revenues as well as a reduction in adjusted operating expenses resulting from good execution of our onb way initiatives despite the challenging interest rate environment we improved our operating leverage by basis points yearoveryear old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 slide shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning asset mix end of period loans increased million quarteroverquarter driven by record commercial production of million approximately twothirds of this production was in highquality cre projects spread across a variety of property types and geographies we also ended the quarter with a record billion commercial loan pipeline with over million in the accepted category this quarters loan portfolio yield excluding ppp was with new business rates of the investment portfolio yield was down basis points quarteroverquarter to with new purchases yielding moving to slide both periodend and average deposits increased during the quarter mostly in the noninterest bearing checking and savings categories deposit balances benefited from increases in existing accounts but more importantly we added a meaningful amount of new deposit accounts as well our total cost of deposits declined from basis points in the second quarter to basis points in q3 while we continue to look for opportunities to reduce funding costs most of our planned rate actions are now complete however time deposits and borrowing costs will continue to fall as these instruments mature and reprice overall we are pleased with our results of our deposit pricing strategy that has resulted in a significant reduction in deposit costs while maintaining our core client base next on slide you will see net interest income was unchanged from prior quarter which was supported by our strong commercial loan growth net interest margin declined basis points quarteroverquarter which was generally in line with our expectations excluding the impact of both ppp loans and accretion net interest margin was compared to in q2 the decline in margin reflects the ongoing repricing of our earning assets as well as excess liquidity core earning asset yields were down basis points quarteroverquarter and funding costs decreased by basis points slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income our third quarter adjusted noninterest income of million represents a million increase over prior quarter the primary drivers of this improvement came from increasing deposit service charges and mortgage revenues depositrelated service charges have generally returned to precrisis levels with the exception of overdraft fees where we continue to see lower presentments mortgage revenue increased million over prior quarter and with million higher than the third quarter of elevated gain on sales margins and robust production of million helped contribute to the stronger quarter next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which reflect our ongoing focus on expense management adjusting for onb way related charges and taxrelated amortization noninterest expense was down million quarteroverquarter and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low as i wrap up my discussion on the quarter here are some key takeaways we are pleased with our overall performance as the fundamentals of our core business continued to be strong record commercial loan production led to meaningful earning asset growth and our fee businesses continue to perform well particularly mortgage and capital markets we also continue to deliver on the promised expense savings we outlined in our onb way strategic plan slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we ended the quarter with a record billion commercial pipeline which should help sustain our recent balance sheet growth our expected earning asset growth will help support total net interest income but the impact of historically low longterm rates will continue to put pressure on net interest margin funding costs will move margins lower as borrowings and cds reprice at maturity but we do not expect this will be sufficient to offset declines in asset yields old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 ppp loans will also impact our margin going forward but the timing remains uncertain ppp fees will continue to amortize over the contractual lives but accelerated recognition will be postponed until repayment from the sba while we have started the forgiveness process for many ppp clients a significant portion of the related fees may not be recognized until next year we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well wealth and investment revenue should be stable as assets under management have rebounded from their second quarter lows most deposit related service charges have recovered nicely and should continue to trend higher our strong yeartodate capital markets result should continue through the remainder of the year and into next the mortgage market has proven more resilient than we expected but will still be subject to typical seasonal declines in the fourth quarter and revenue could be impacted by refi burnout we continue to outpace our planned onb way expense initiatives and have now realized most of the savings promised this year strong yeartodate performance may impact fourth quarter incentive accruals as we currently are on track to outperform our budget as jim mentioned in his opening remarks we are renewing our focus on achieving our onb way revenue initiative goals many of which were delayed due to covid19 as these initiatives ramp up over the next several quarters we will likely see an increase in personnel costs as we look to hire talent in key revenue positions in our commercial and wealth businesses were also looking to infuse new talent to our technology team that will be focused on supporting both revenue and efficiency initiatives we would also like to give you an update on our current capital position and outlook we accreted an additional basis points of cet1 capital ending the quarter at a healthy i would also reiterate that based on our current capital levels and our outlook on earnings we believe we will continue to outearn our dividend weve also recently updated our stress test model and under the ccar severely adverse scenario we remain well capitalized at the lowest point in the ninequarter horizon lastly a brief update on taxes as we previously reported project delays caused by covid19 have impacted the timing of our historic tax credit projects those projects restarted in q3 and we now anticipate completion by yearend barring some unforeseen issues we will take the full tax credit amortization and corresponding tax benefit in the fourth quarter the total net income benefit in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately million with that we are happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys i hope everyone is doing well james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp we are r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good good and i appreciate you taking the question jim i guess the first question i wanted to touch base on was some of the commercial growth i think you guys have been pretty candid in the second quarter about maybe not being super optimistic on pullthrough rates and i think weve generally seen that in fact be the case industrywide it looks like you guys kind of bucked the trend so maybe just a little more color on how pull through rates actually came in relative to what you would have hoped and then maybe a bit more detail on complexion of the growth as well if you could sort of bifurcate it between commercial and commercial real estate james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp sure ill let jim sandgren start off here james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah scott so from a pullthrough rate perspective we were at a very low in the second quarter that increased to in the third quarter clearly i think folks were kind of waitandsee due to all the uncertainty but again demand continues to be really strong obviously commercial real estate kind of paved the way for our growth in third quarter and as both jim and daryl talked about really highquality projects with developers that we are very familiar with were starting to see even better structure both from a pricing perspective more cash equity in the deals so we really feel good about the production were putting on from that standpoint ci also was up in the quarter compared to the second quarter we saw some opportunities in the educational areas contractors manufacturing so with the pipeline where it is today were really encouraged about fourth quarter and beyond so even given all the uncertainty of the election and all that our customers are still willing to invest and pretty bullish as we look toward the end of the year old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp scott i would say that its really been interesting as weve been out competing for new deals oftentimes we find ourselves the only ones working really hard at it and i think thats given us some great opportunities as i said on the call jim and i personally have been on a lot of calls here during the quarter trying to bring deals across the finish line theres been some banks that quite frankly have been a little distracted and weve been a little bit more focused i think our new organizational structure through the onb way that segmentbased approach really gives us the ability to focus and get all our resources lined up to help win these relationships and bring the full relationship over so i think this is a good sign that the programs and the systems and the process weve put in place are really starting to work r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah at a minimum it definitely looks like it came through in the third quarter so that was a pleasant surprise visàvis what weve seen in others maybe just a separate followon question more financial brendon just looking at the sort of the puts and takes on the volume and rate side in nii would the hope or aspiration be that you could ultimately hold nii at least flat given the pressures on margin but some of the volumes that you guys are experiencing brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i think earning asset growth will certainly help to even interest income im not sure its going to fully offset the headwinds were going to feel in the net interest margin percentage as we look forward we think we might have a similar maybe slightly lower decline in fourth quarter and then i think we have a fairly dramatic dropoff but still a kind of slow grind downward into but at a much lower level r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay and you were talking about the margin rate with the indiscernible brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp the dollar r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah in dollars in dollars some of its going to depend on the strength of the earning asset growth i dont know that the earning asset growth will be sufficient to offset all of the margin headwinds but will certainly be a benefit r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay terrific thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone maybe start with an expense question jim i think you said the investments in the onb way revenue initiatives on the hiring side would push expenses higher on a quarterly basis and it also sounds like thats going to continue into next year i was wondering if you could kind of quantify that increase off the million kind of core run rate that i calculated and just to be clear is that kind of a pretty good run rate to think about each quarter next year or will there be some decline in the latter part of the year james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp we anticipated your question and brendons got all the details here for you terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so i think the million is a good base i think as we think about those positions were going to hire several of those individuals over the course of our expected impact for that is around million into id just remind you though that we have roughly million of merit increases that will hit next year and also i would expect some of that customer travel and entertainment expenses to trend higher as the world opens up again terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 and then let me just ask a cecl question if the key economic assumptions that you list on page if they remain unchanged over the next three months how should we then think about the quarterly loan loss provision is it more a reflection of loan growth as any chargeoffs would likely be already captured in todays reserves brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so as we will continue to run the model and if the economic conditions were unchanged and the reserve level is exactly what it is today is whats needed at the end of the year then yes we would cover chargeoffs how thats going to play out we have yet to see obviously moodys expects things to continue and to improve so our reserve need may fall but we are at this point not expected to release reserves until we start to see some meaningful chargeoffs start to flow through terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thats it thank you both james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone one followup on terrys last question on slide the qualitative factors i think we all understand theres a lot of uncertainty but maybe can you talk a little bit about some of the key drivers that went into that and what could get that to potentially flatten out in the future brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i think we need to get some clarity around the path of the virus any additional government actions and get a sense for what the ultimate chargeoff levels will be i dont know that well have a lot of those answers until at least into the first half of as we get clarity around that well be able to think differently potentially around the size of that qualitative reserve james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i just given the uncertainty out there were going to lean on being more conservative in our assumptions here right as we get more clarity which is probably not likely to happen until the middle part of next year then i think we can be looking at those factors a little bit differently but just given all of the economic uncertainty i think its better to hold it up a little higher here old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thank you for that and then daryl maybe one for you you talked about the potential for and maybe you too jim for rising nonperformers and losses and i think we all expect that but just give us kind of a gut feel the pipeline of potential problem loans and how we should think about the cadence of some of these problems flowing through daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp jon i wish i knew the answer to that right that is something that the whole industry is a bit struggling with and ill go back to what jim and brendon said were only really less than two full quarters kind of into this and so as we see interim financial information from our clients its just really hard to try to understand what ultimate losses are going to come on that portfolio and again i dont want to fall back into what everybodys saying but the fiscal stimulus is going to have a big impact on this by industry most banks including ours who have taken the hotel industry we know were pretty certain that that is a long tail and so weve gone ahead and taking our actions on that in terms of downgrades and im not trying to skirt the question its just a very tough thing to try to figure out now where were going to be in another days and i cant give you much clarity around it james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp and jon ill just say were trying not to be surprised here right i mean we meet weekly with this group on the call and plus some other senior commercial credit folks and were really trying to understand the trajectory of each one of our clients and which ones are more sensitive than others so were not trying to be surprised ourselves but as daryl said generally those conversations have gone pretty well surprisingly well but theres a lot of uncertainty out there and like darryl said we havent seen a lot of interim financials and so its pretty hard to put a pinpoint on it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one small one for brendon on expenses again back to expenses you talked about potential for incentive accruals due to outperformance for the year have you accrued some of that already or whats kind of the magnitude youre thinking for that accrual expense line brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp we did we started to adjust accruals in q3 but we would expect another adjustment if things play out the way we expect in the tune of million or so jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats the incremental for the fourth quarter is what youre saying brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey jim morning morning everybody i want to start maybe on capital you talked about the capital build but also daryls the comments about the uncertainty jim im interested in your thoughts about capital management into next year i think youve talked pretty confidently consistently about the dividend sustainability but what about the share buyback component how are you and the board thinking about ultimately flipping that back on james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp well i think were going to take a cue a little bit from the regulators here right and the regulators have basically said nothing this year obviously theyre not really talking about us i think theyre talking about our biggest cousins here but were going to take that cue and we do have board members asking when are we going to have confidence to be able to turn that back on having said that i think its in the next year again as we just have more insights into ultimate loss content we feel pretty good today but it just seems a little premature to want to turn that back on yet christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and appreciate the color you gave on the expenses and investments youre making as part of the onb way but can you just remind us how youre thinking about the revenue side of the equation that you spoke confidently about in your prepared remarks just the timing and when we should start seeing any contribution from the revenue investments james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp well i do think i mean so we have hired folks already a number of folks are ready across their geographies and i do think the growth youre seeing on both the deposit side and the loan side are really the start of really those initiatives so higher growth in our wealth management business that would be both the kind of the balance sheet side so the private banking side but also the fee income side and obviously our commercial business we havent shared any targets its too early to share any targets yet especially given kind of the economic uncertainty but i think those are the kind of line items fee income continued strong deposit growth and then the commercial side as well old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe just last one if i could so im looking at slide comparing it to last quarter it looks like ci spreads jumped up almost basis points excluding the ppp any color on is that just youre out in the market lending and some of your peers are on their heels i guess what is that is that likely to continue or what do you see in james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah chris its a little bit of both right i mean i think we are as jim said not everybody else is out doing what were doing but i also think theres a wide variance quarterin quarterout just based on how many notes were fixed rate versus floating rate this stuff tends to be a little bit more floating rate which drives down the absolute yield but that mix shift can also shift these numbers around quarterin quarterout but we are getting i would say slightly better pricing not more id like to get more pricing but its slightly better than we have seen in the last year for sure christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay awesome thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thanks for taking my question want to get back to that qualitative portion of the reserve really quick just do you have a specific internal projection that youre using as to what the next stimulus package may look like in coming up with that ultimate reserve level brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp we do not i can tell you i think moodys had an expectation in their forecast for i think trillion stimulus happening in september so the fact that that didnt get done and maybe delayed did influence our thoughts and decisions around the qualitative reserve but we dont have a specific forecast internally david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay thank you and then switching gears to the mortgage banking side obviously strong again there how does the upcoming basis point fee impact your origination expectations and is that something that you can pass along or how do you think thats going to work out old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp i think its all too early to tell how much of that we can pass along i think our own internal projections or assuming we take that out of our spreads i mean spreads have increased in that business throughout the kind of refi bonanza weve all seen here so that probably at some level comes out of our margin but im hopeful that we could pass along some of that increase through new production as well david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay and then finally on the capital side obviously youre in a very good position right now but what would change or what in the economy would it take to change to change your outlook like how bad does it have to get in the overall economy for you to change your outlook and consider raising additional capital james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thats a good question brendon and ive kind of chuckled a little bit we were supposed to learn our lessons as an industry heading into whatever the next crisis looked like and i felt like we had enough capital heading into this and brendon shared our stress tests that were running right so things would have to get pretty draconian before i think id have to move off my position here i understand the rationale for kind of opportunistic issuances particularly if we had a use for it but at this point in time we feel very comfortable with our stress test models and obviously theyre models and they could be wrong but it has to be significantly different than what our most severely stressed environments look like in order for us to have a probably different view on that david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it good to hear cool thanks jim james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott again how are you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks for taking the followup james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co was just curious given some of that balance sheet growth is that pretty broadbased across the franchise or are there indiscernible like is it the sort of the legacy onb franchise or is it some of the newer markets that you guys have how is that all sort of projecting james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yes scott specifically on the cre id say a big chunk of that really is up in the twin cities specifically in the suburban areas some multifamily opportunities there with the developers that i talked about earlier also have seen some growth in wisconsin parts of michigan and in and around louisville so it really has been spread around kind of a mix of our legacy markets and our newer markets james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp jim and i are heading to minnesota after this call and so weve been spending time out actually walking some of these projects getting firsthand insights into them so this isnt a handsoff approach were very active in the business we want to make sure the things were investing today we feel really good about and so its nice to see that kind of continued growth were seeing in minnesota and despite some of the challenges theyre having there the economic vibrancy is still very strong r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you guys again james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp sorry dorothy operator thats okay your next question comes from the line of kevin swanson with hovde group kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc hi guys james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 kevin how are you kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc good how are you james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc as regards to expense initiatives has there been any additional lookback at the branch footprint when considering the effects of covid pandemic james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp absolutely its something that we review pretty regularly as our branch footprint and the board has challenged us to make sure that weve got an appropriate footprint we dont have any new assessment to share with anybody but its something wed look at pretty regularly and we do think over time just as customers continue to move transactions to mobile and other online platforms we will continue to have opportunities to look at those branches a little bit differently but at this time dont have anything new to share kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc okay thanks and then could you talk about the parameters of what you would or would not be interested in doing for ma and then maybe any changes in expectations or willingness to sell i guess james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp well i think given the interest rate environments going to be a challenge for our industry and i think as people put together the forecasts for next year and do the strategic planning it could open up some opportunities for us we continue to think consolidating within our current footprint makes the most amount of sense and so were really focused there weve talked about potential partnerships that are more meaningful fewer of them but more meaningful and i continue to be very active it was a very active summer for me to make sure that i was calling on folks that were interested in and we continue to do that and be purposeful about that so its on our minds and obviously the farther we get into the pandemic the easier it would be to put some balance sheet marks together i think its still a little early to be honest with you but the farther we get into it it would be easier to think about a potential partnership but at this point time were not looking i think today so were just going to continue to keep be open for opportunities kevin swanson q analyst hovde group llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2020 okay thank you operator you have a follow up question from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yes terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi hey i forgot to ask i think it was last thursday or friday a bunch of states had their highest oneday covid case count and i believe indiana wisconsin and minnesota unfortunately were in that count earlier in the year that was the exact opposite and jim you kind of talked about maybe the upside to your franchise just given how it was impacting different parts of the country in a different way and now its kind of come closer to home so i guess what are your updated thoughts there and do you have any kind of updated thoughts on some of the vulnerable industries and whether that count goes higher whether those industries need to be looked at yet again james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp all good questions thankfully i would just start with our team members and our own experience here within our four walls so to speak has been relatively good we continue to make sure that our team members remain health and safety its paramount right but having said that obviously were all concerned and were cautious about whats going on to some of our geographies im hopeful that its kind of temporary as everybody move back to colleges and maybe saw a number of increases from that were watching the numbers very closely our chief risk officer sends very regular updates on this topic even during the height of maybe the first or second wave i didnt see we have so little restaurants and the hotel exposures we talked about are pretty welldefined i just dont see much difference today then i saw back then even when the numbers were trending better so i dont think its gives us any kind of different outlook terry but some were watching very very closely if nothing else for the health and safety of our team members terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks again james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator and
