the first quarter of operating preprovision net revenues increased from the year ago quarter as we managed positive operating leverage of the overall success of fnbs financial performance was due to the consistent execution of our previously stated strategic initiatives for example we set out to diversify income and rely on various sources to maintain performance this quarter fnb reported record wealth management revenue of million on a linkedquarter basis contributing to our stable noninteresting income we also strive to be our customers primary operating bank and through our deep customer relationships and granular deposit base we were able to maintain stable average deposit balances our philosophy of maintaining consistent and prudent underwriting standard regardless of the

levels through the industry disruption are a testament to the success of our focus on growing client relationships with deposits ending the quarter at billion a slight decline of from the prior quarter outperforming the h8 deposit data for small and large banks between march when the industry volatility began in quarterend our deposit balances were essentially flat declining primarily due to seasonal outflows with normal wholesale and retail customer activity another strength is the diversity of our deposit base throughout the different customer segments with consumer account balances comprising the largest segment of total deposits at the consumer segment is comprised of approximately million accounts with the median consumer deposit balance at quarterend around fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 additionally since march we experienced a net increase in the number of accounts across all customer segments positioning fnb as a benefactor as deposit inflows are restored to normal levels and customers diversify funds between banks because of the granularity in our deposit base fnb ended the quarter with approximately of deposits either insured by the fdic or collateralized which exceeds the peer median for the banks in the krx bank index at year end if necessary we also have available liquidity to fund up to of our uninsured and noncollateralized deposit balances as of march placing fnb in a very strong liquidity position fnbs investment portfolio philosophy is also conservative by nature with respect to duration and risk we managed to an average duration of between three to five years and have historically maintained a fairly even split between available for sale and held to maturity at the onset of the current banking industry disruption fnb management activated our contingency funding plans our teams response was swift and working diligently over the weekend to ensure that our board of directors will indiscernible employees were reassured of our stability and customerfacing personnel began proactive client outreach ph with talking points regarding the strength of our balance sheet including fnbs capital liquidity position on a relative and outright basis in addition we bolstered our liquidity position by increasing cash on the balance sheet by nearly billion through the financial crisis pandemic and now the banking industry disruption fnb has earned our customers trust and we promise to uphold that trust as we have positioned the company to outperform the industry in a wide array of potential economic and industry scenarios credit continues to remain as one of our strengths im very pleased to once again report a solid credit position with low delinquency at basis ph points i will now turn the call over to gary to give more details on our asset quality and our consistent management of credit risk gary gary l guerrieri chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thank you vince and good morning everyone we ended the quarter with our credit portfolio well positioned and our asset quality metrics remaining near historically low levels our performance for the period reflects total delinquency that ended the quarter at basis points npls and oreo at basis points and net charge offs at basis points criticized loans were up moderately at basis points quarteroverquarter although down basis points yearoveryear and still at historically low levels i will cover these gaap asset quality highlights for the quarter in more detail followed by some insight into our credit strategy we used to manage the loan portfolio throughout economic cycles lets now walk through our credit results total delinquency declined basis points in the quarter maintaining the historically low delinquency levels seen in previous quarters npls and oreo were down basis point compared to the prior quarter with of our npls in a contractually current payment status net chargeoffs for the quarter totaled million or basis points on an annualized basis with basis points reflecting the use of previously established specific reserves total provision expense for the quarter stood at million providing for loan growth and chargeoffs that did not have a previously established specific reserve ceclrelated model builds were moderate at approximately million our ending funded reserve increased million in the quarter and stands at million or a solid fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 of loans reflecting our strong position relative to our peers when including acquired unamortized loan discounts our reserve stands at and our npl coverage position remains strong at we remain steadfast in our approach to consistent underwriting and managing credit risk to maintain a balanced wellpositioned portfolio throughout economic cycles we proactively review and stress test portfolios on an ongoing basis including in the current quarter where we performed an indepth review of commercial real estate loans maturing in and we were pleased with the outcome of that exercise and did not have any risk rating changes which was not unexpected as we maintain a diversified commercial real estate portfolio backed by strong sponsors and low ltvs regarding the office portfolio delinquency remains very low at basis points and criticized loans are below our top office exposures averaged million and of the loans are less than million we have and will continue to aggressively manage this portfolio on a loanbyloan basis as part of the indepth reviews we regularly perform in closing we had a successful quarter marked by the strength and favorable positioning of our credit portfolio as we continue to generate diversified loan growth in attractive markets we closely monitor macroeconomic trends in the individual markets in our footprint and well continue to manage risk proactively and aggressively as part of our core credit philosophy which has served us well in softer economic times i will now turn the call over to vince calabrese our chief financial officer for his remarks vincent j calabrese chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks gary good morning everyone today i will focus on the first quarters financial results provide some color on our balance sheet management activities during the banking disruption in march and offer guidance updates for the remainder of first quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled million or per share with record revenue contributions seasonally higher expenses and continued solid asset quality performance total earning assets reached an alltime high ending the quarter at billion with the million quarterly increase driven by loans and leases growing million or annualized commercial loans increased million or annualized driven by the continued success of our strategy to grow highquality loans across our diverse geographic footprint while commercial production was slightly lighter than the fourth quarter reflecting normal seasonality attrition approved and loan pipeline increased sequentially after the robust loan production last quarter consumer loans increased million linkedquarter or annualized as growth in residential mortgages of million was partially offset by decreases in average direct home equity installment loan balances consumer lines of credit and indirect auto loans given the high rate environment organic growth in residential mortgage reflects customers continued preference for adjustablerate mortgages as well as the continued success of our physicians first mortgage program both of which we currently keep in portfolio investment portfolio remains stable at billion with classified as available for sale when including the fair value ph marks in our afs and atm portfolios our cet1 ratio is above the peer median calculated on the same basis and we remain wellcapitalized fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 duration of our securities portfolio at march 31st is years and inclusive of our cash position is years total deposits ended the quarter at billion a decrease of million linkedquarter or largely due to normal first quarter seasonality in fact since march deposits were relatively flat with a slight decline due to normal outflows from wholesale and retail customer activity vince mentioned earlier our median consumer deposit balance was at the end of march when looking at the total deposit portfolio our average account balance is approximately which is well below silicon valley banks average of million and signature banks we are also lower than our peer median as of yearend the deposit mix did shift this quarter with time deposits increasing billion as customers moved funds out of money market accounts to take advantage of higher cd rates as of march 31st our mix of noninterestbearing deposits remained strong at of total deposits down slightly from at yearend our loantodeposit ratio remained at a comfortable level ending the quarter below in light of the banking industry disruption we decided to bolster our onbalance sheet liquidity position by increasing short and longterm borrowings by about billion in the aggregate bringing our excess cash position to billion at quarter end looking at the income statement record quarterly revenue of million was driven by net interest income totaling million a linkedquarter increase of million or the net interest margin expanded basis points as the earning asset yield increased basis points with loan yields up basis points while the cost of funds increased basis points prudently managing deposit costs in this rate environment continues to be a significant focus spot interest bearing deposit cost ended the quarter at ph million with the quarterly average coming in at ph million reflecting the ongoing diligent work by our team total cumulative deposit betas ended the quarter with within our prior guidance of turning to noninterest income and expense noninterest income totaled million a slight decrease of in the fourth quarter of last year wealth management reached a record million with a quarterly increase of million mostly split between securities commissions and fees driven by strong annuity revenue and audio gap services primarily from strong organic growth seasonality higher production and contingent revenues led to a million or linkedquarter increase in insurance commissions and fees while mortgage banking operations income increased million linkedquarter reflecting a increase in sold mortgage volume and improved gain on sale margins capital markets income decreased million due to reduced syndications and swap fees from very strong levels in the fourth quarter of service charges in the quarter decreased million largely reflecting the expected decline in overdraft and nonsufficient fund charges due to our previously announced ph fee program changes given the current competitive environment operating noninterest expense totaled million an increase from the fourth quarter largely reflecting normal seasonality combined with the addition of the union expense base for a full quarter and the impact of the previously announced increase in the fdic insurance assessment rate salaries and employee benefits increased million of which approximately million was related to normal seasonal compensation activity including million of longterm compensation and seasonally higher fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 employerpaid payroll taxes the remaining million increase primarily from reduced salary deferral given lower loan origination volumes and the addition of the acquired union expense base even with these expense items the efficiency ratio remains at a favorable level of our capital ratios ended the quarter at levels that are expected to be at or above peer median tangible book value per common share was at march 31st an increase of per share or in december largely from the higher level of earnings and the decreased impact of aoci which reduced the current quarter end tangible book value by per share compared to at year end as vince mentioned our tce ratio is one of the highest in company history at to demonstrate the strength of this level amidst the industry disruption tce adjusted for our htm unrealized losses equals which is basis points higher than our peer median using recorded yearend levels lets now look at financial objectives starting with the balance sheet on a full year spot basis we maintained our previous guide for loans to increase midsingle digits yearoveryear total deposits projected to end at a similar level as of december spot balances although we do expect a continued shift in the deposit mix given the current rate environment full year net interest income is expected to be between billion and billion with the second quarter between million to million our guidance currently assumes a basis point rate hike in may and then flat for the remainder of the year the modest decrease in guidance from last quarter is largely related to our expectation for higher deposit betas given the current banking industry environment if rates were to come down this year as the forward curve currently is projecting that could lead to modest upside to our nii forecast full year noninterest income is expected to be between million and million with a slight upward revision reflecting our first quarter ph beat relative to our previous guidance second quarter is expected to be in the mid70 million range with continued benefits from the diversified revenue strategy full year guidance for noninterest expense on an operating basis is million to million adjustment has to account for the higher first quarter expense levels but the remaining nine months are expected to be consistent with our prior guidance second quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between million to million full year provision guidance remains million to million and is dependent on net loan growth potential cecl model related builds from a softer macroeconomic environment lastly the effective tax rate should be between and for the full year which does not include any investment tax credit activity that may occur with that i will turn the call back to vince vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania our conservative business practices have positioned fnb to sustain solid performance during turbulence in our industry we ended the first quarter with a strong capital position and stable deposit base and are confident that we are poised to capitalize on this

choice award winner for women and millennial women fnb earned these awards through the hard work and dedication of our employees who share our commitment to our values and mission thank you to our team for cultivating an environment that succeeds in creating shareholder value while respecting one another and winning together technical difficulty question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from frank schiraldi of piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning vince you mentioned the negative carry or you mentioned the additional liquidity on the balance sheet just wondering what the negative carry is on that and is that a primary driver of the lower nii guide or is it more of the mix shift i guess you now have accelerating a bit into time it seems vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the negative carry frank is really like maybe basis points its not that significant as you know were earning our excess cash position was still at billion where we earned million on that i think the ph borrowings now were around million or so its not a big negative carry its just the mix shift and stuff continuing to roll given current deposit rates frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just kind of curious i dont know if you have this granularity there in front of you but as you think about the mix shift thats baked into your guide what does that sort of assume in terms of noninterestbearing levels as a percentage of total deposits by the end of the year vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania it comes down slightly between now and the end of the year as you know thats a big focus in the company our account acquisition strategy and lending strategy has always revolved around bringing in the operating accounts and those continued efforts continue to bring in new accounts and during this disrupting period we actually net out of accounts but as a vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah id say weve talked about customer primacy what we mean by that is were the principal operating bank or were the disbursement bank for consumers and businesses and if you look at the granularity in the consumer book that we mentioned on the call in the prepared comments theres thats pretty sticky theres not a lot of fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 places to go to to earn more on i dont know that it is impactful enough for people to move their money around and we tend to be that tends to be their principal operating account for us so theyre going to keep cash to cover items that are presented for payment and its where direct deposit is credited into and then on the business side as weve said historically if you look at the concentration of of the deposits that we have in the commercial segment a good bit of that is tied directly to services so compensating balances where we gain an earnings credit that sits in a noninterestbearing bucket and again tends to be sticky because customers prefer using balances to pay for services versus paying cash ph fee so thats all embedded into that noninterest dda category so we feel pretty good about having a good solid base and at a minimum we feel well outperform others who may be relying on more transient balances i think it shows basically if you look back historically you can see it in our performance relative to other banks in the category frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hope that helps frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co i appreciate that yeah and then just lastly as a followup just a question for gary on the on credit in the slide deck you talked about the average ltvs i think its in the office book specifically in the low im guessing i assume thats largely value at origination of these loans and im just wondering as youve gone through this in depth portfolio review what that sort of tell you if you can share what thats telling you about where value has moved in some of your markets in terms of the underlying property in sort of percentage terms thanks gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah weve updated various appraisals frank on properties in that space weve seen reductions generally speaking in the to highteen range into the we did have one that had some leasing issues that got into the but so far at this point thats the range that we have been experiencing and thats pretty much been across the board with the ones that weve had to update frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate that thanks vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania and then frank just to clarify on the negative carry question i forgot we had some portion of what we took down with ph twoyear money like million kind of all in the additional liquidity which really had no negative carry kind of all in on a flat basis fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks operator the next question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks good morning everyone maybe first on the operating expense guidance if you could just give me an idea of what drove the overall outlook higher given i guess my overarching thought that with the outlook down that that should drive a decline in incentive compensation vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i can comment on that danny expenses for the quarter on an operating basis came in at million our range from january was million to million so million above the high end of that range half of that variance was just lower deferrals on loan origination costs and lower consumer volumes consumer loan volumes than what we had planned so that was kind of half of that million difference and then the rest of it was really a handful of kind of onetime items if you look at our guidance for the second quarter million to million that compares to million figure thats consistent with our original guidance that we gave in january in fact the nine months as i mentioned in my prepared remarks is unchanged from what we had said before so its really just a combination of lower ph fas deferrals half of it and then some onetime items so as we move forward depending on how the year plays out there is commission incentive comps and variable depending on how much revenue we create thatll be up or down so that is a swing item or a variable expense that will vary depending on indiscernible ultimately but its really just it was million above the high end of the range so its not that significant and the guidance forward well manage expenses diligently as we always have daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc i appreciate that sorry i missed the your comment in the prepared remarks on the stable from prior guidance for the rest of the year but thanks for that and then maybe a couple for gary here on credit first the office portfolio appreciate all the incremental detail there just wondering if you had a breakdown of i know you mentioned its spread across the footprint but what properties are in what cities or urban versus suburban any way that we could get more detail into kind of the type of city that those offices are in gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 well i mean the majority of the larger office facilities are in the metro cities daniel as mentioned in the remarks i mean almost half of that book is under million so theyre kind of scattered in suburban markets for the most part but in terms of those appraisals we had one with leasing issues in pittsburgh that came down we had one in the carolinas that came down so its pretty much across the board vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania gary just to clarify like you said the majority vast majority of our cre exposure is suburban in nature i know you said metro markets but we cannot finance on a longterm basis large office facilities other than our own but i mean we dont were not in that business right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no with the average being million i mean that kind of speaks to the top the million speaks to the type of properties and locations we have very little urban big city center type of office properties very little vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and our ltvs are very conservative i think a portion of the portfolio thats in construction fund up basically typically secured by leases so we dont do a lot of spec or hardly any so thats backed up by leases and the ltvs are going to be a little higher on the construction pieces of the portfolio versus what we have in our book because we tend not to keep large exposures we underwrite them to permanent takeout so i just want to make sure everybody understands that the makeup of the numbers on the slide that we presented are for nonowner occupied cre daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay terrific thanks for that thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc and lastly just a followup there on not on office but in i guess the macro outlook overall the reserves came down in the quarter which was a little bit surprising but just curious on your thoughts on the driver there of reserves down and then your thoughts on the overall macro outlook i guess relative to last quarter gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah actually dollar reserves were not down and the reserve was down from to so it was down basis point still at million and we use some specific reserves that i mentioned in the prepared remarks in terms of that basis point so we look at it as flattish and when you include the unamortized loan discounts at million i mean our reserve position compared to peers is very strong fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i think above our peers ph than to basis points if you look at our coverage level danny versus the peers thats a significant buffer over and above where others have been carrying their reserves daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc understood no i got you all right well i appreciate all the color thats it for me thanks guys gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks dan vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks dan operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared maybe just continuing the last line of questioning on the allowance ratio i mean to your point it is quite elevated compared to peers i guess how much of a pending recession reserve is already embedded in your numbers and i guess if we do end up in a more punitive macro environment does that basis point buffer kind of hold true as the rest of the group catches up or some of that already embedded in your more cautious starting point gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah timur weve taken a cautious position ever since we got into six months into covid we felt very strongly that it was going to be an issue for quite some time we did not release reserves as other institutions did during that timeframe in large sums and we looked at it from a standpoint that we wanted to maintain those reserves based on what we saw coming down the road and then we get into what appears to be naturally a softer economic timeframe so weve been able to maintain those reserves theyre well within our ranges of being quantitative versus qualitative and its an analysis that we go through each and every month actually we rerun the reserve every week based on the changes in the portfolio weektoweek so when you look at that position we feel good about where we are and were going to continue to manage it accordingly fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then gary one more for you just following up on the line of questioning regarding the office book i guess for the you laid out maturity in in i guess for those loans that are coming up for kind of maturity or refi cycle whats the new rate that they would be rolling into and i guess whats the confidence on kind of the underlying occupancy and underlying trends that there is the ability to absorb the higher interest rate that theyd be rolling into gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah we just did a deep dive on every single one of those larger credits during the quarter and we had no downgrades as i mentioned in the remarks around those credits we manage them on a regular basis on a loan byloan basis and so that most recent review which reflected no downgrades took into consideration those maturity walls and the ability to reset generally in the range so weve got that built into those particular situations ill also mention that ltvs generally in the naturally some of thats going to take a hit when you have some leases roll out but the sponsorship is extremely strong across that book and we feel that its very manageable based on the most recent review which reflected no downgrades as i mentioned vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey gary gary the question that came up about our reserves relative to peers i think its helpful to mention that our criticizing classified loan ratios are typically higher than the other banks because of our aggressive gradation it doesnt necessarily translate into net chargeoffs so if you look at over a long period of time fnb versus the peers we tend to run higher but then have lower chargeoffs throughout the cycle thats a function of our credit people being very aggressive and proactive in downgrading credit which results in a higher reserve position so the gradation really matters within the portfolio other institutions could delay or have delays in their assessment of risk and they wont see the same level of reserves until the very tail end of a crisis so it should be viewed as a positive not a negative i just want to make sure everybody understands that indiscernible gary gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no i would agree with everything you said there vince i mean were very aggressive around the management of risk ratings as you mentioned and this portfolio is front and center for certain and it has been for quite some time timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no thats a good color i appreciate that maybe one for vince calabrese on slide the interest rate sensitivity it looks like the shock to both the bps up and the bps down increase im just wondering what they dynamic is that nii benefits in both an upside and the downside scenario fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 scott free a executive vice president treasurer fnb corporation sure this is scott free the treasurer the inverted yield curve has kind of created a unique circumstance where with the deposit rates finally moving up the down scenario now will start to get indiscernible moving those balance a little faster than indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then just last for me any thoughts around the buyback the banks are kind of all over the place in terms of continuing it pausing it you guys are active in the first quarter im just wondering if you can give any color as to what was repurchased kind of subsequent to march and then what the outlook is for the buyback going forward vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well id like to start out by saying if you look at our capital position relative to others we stand out because of the limited aoci impairment and conservative management of our investment portfolio indiscernible whos sitting there with us so i think that puts us in a different position were already cet1 were already were bargaining so we expect capital appreciation to continue to advance those capital ratios that gives us a little bit more flexibility than others having said that were still very cautious because of the environment that were in im not quite sure how things play out throughout the rest of the year im a little bit cautious because i feel that we are headed into a recessionary period and were seeing some slowing down in the economy in various sectors so were getting mixed signals but because of that were going to proceed very cautiously but we do have the capacity to do it if we desire to do so and if its beneficial to the shareholders so vince i dont know if you want to add any color to that but vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no i would just say i mean the target that weve talked about we still think is very appropriate given the risk profile of the balance sheet so as we move forward with do as vince said expect that to kind of gradually build from here we have capacity i mean well be thoughtful about repurchasing we purchased in the ph 13th if we get comfortable with the environment wed like to be repurchasing in the ph 11th obviously so i think theres definitely interest in having some of that deployed as we go through the year its just going to be kind of a matter of when vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania and just to confirm none of the fourth quarter repurchase activity happened when the market disruption started well before that right but i will say again were in a different position than others fortunately so we have options and well be very careful about how we execute those options but we do have the capacity to do it others do not thats why youre getting mixed responses fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you appreciate all the color vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania the only other thing i would add timur too is on the asset sensitivity just to add to what scott was saying if you look at the numbers its very close to neutral the numbers plus or minus are not significant like they may have been or months ago so you get that slight benefit whether its a plus or minus but youre kind of starting to triangulate around kind of neutral position there operator the next question comes from michael perito with kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning guys thanks for taking my questions vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc you guys have hit most of it i guess just one kind of bigger picture question around loan growth here i guess what you guys have talked a lot about the credit side but i guess what about in terms of the funding side i mean is there scenario that that could impact your appetite for incremental loan growth here i mean obviously i think in response to recent events the cd growth kind of across the industry has surged i would imagine that will continue to a certain extent maybe not quite as severely as it did over the last days of the quarter but is there a scenario where the funding if it sustains at kind of like the current beta increase and higher cost ph cdds where that could impact your appetite to book new loan growth vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think our guidance is pretty conservative for us given the markets that were in and if you look at our deposit base and our liquidity position the mix of our deposits we have a lot of avenues to drive liquidity that still creates a scenario where its accretive to book loans so i dont think were going to be impacted like others might be im not suggesting i think youre spot on across the industry but thats what differentiates us again our conservative nature the fact that the companys been positioned with the deposit base that it has and our conservative credit underwriting standards gives us the ability to continue to lend through the cycle very selectively fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 so while demand may fall off therell be fewer players out there looking to originate i think the last cycle we went through we saw it so we may have an opportunity to increase share in the markets that weve expanded into relative to a number of competitors i dont see us in a position where we have to pull back and ive told our employees that they should be very happy that they work here particularly if youre in the lending business so while its difficult during good times because we tend to be a little more conservative our ability to sustain our lending activity through the cycle is real and garys philosophy about credit is real so we stay within a narrow band and we dont try to outgrow ourselves during frothy times and take on undue risk and during times like this were in the market supporting our clients and growing share i think thats utopia for commercial banker i wouldnt say thats the case for everyone as you look across the broad spectrum of banks everyones in a different position but fnb is in a very sound position relative to achieving our guidance michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful vince thanks and then not to put the cart in front of the horse here but just as you guys think about that relative strength and we get through these next couple of quarters and maybe hopefully finally get a better idea of whether were going into a recession or maybe things stabilize what have you i mean how does that translate to i mean i think one of the reasons that you guys are in this position is just because of the diversity of the franchise line of business youve got geography ma obviously historically has been a big part of achieving that diversity and then theres dislocation you guys are kind of strongly positioned here i mean what type of opportunities longer term do you think could stem from for fnb from all this dislocation vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i certainly think the industry is going to change i think the landscape is going to change because of whats gone on there will be pressure on others as we move through this cycle were going to stay very focused on managing risk making sure we have ample liquidity pricing our funding appropriately not worrying too much about growth worrying more about margin as we move through this portion of this economic cycle but i do think that there will be opportunities on the other end of it i dont know what they are i will tell you though that weve also done a terrific job our team done a great job of building businesses from the ground up so if you look at our noninterest income which performed pretty well this year and reflecting on the prepared comments vince mentioned the wealth management business weve had good success in insurance we have a very granular diversified group of businesses that generate the income from the company and thats largely been grown organic so well continue to focus on building out our capabilities within those groups to derive fee income which is an annuity benefit to the earnings and then were going to stay focused on our digital strategy i think the award that we received for the estore was fairly substantial where large large the largest banks in the world applied to be recognized and we were selected so our strategy is different we are very focused on continuing to add features to that and continuing to penetrate the customer base that we have and the prospects that we have in the seven states that we operate in which are pretty good states to be in so i think thats the focus as we move forward and ive already gone over our ma strategy weve talked about it before but i think for now were just pausing and were going to wait to see what shakes out i think we will come through this in a position of strength so well have plenty of opportunities indiscernible fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great no that makes sense i appreciate you guys provided some color call today thank you vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yes thanks michael appreciate it gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks mike operator the next question comes from russell gunther with stephens please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania hey russel russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc i just wanted to hey gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania good morning russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc just a quick followup you guys mentioned the liquidity steps taken in the quarter and excess cash just remind us of your target level of whether its cash to assets and have that bogey changed at all intraquarter even just for the near term vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i mean weve been managing that cash position fluidly over the last year or so i would say that we took down quite audio gap billion dollars or so of liquidity when we brought in liquidity just given the uncertainty in the environment and just given our conservative nature so that was billion we wouldnt have otherwise taken so we thought that was the smart thing to do and conservative thing to do in this environment and when we look at what we put on so our total wholesale funding today about billion about a third of it is two years a third is one year and the other third is inside of six fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 months so kind of put a ladder together and we use that kind of over time to kind of fund what we indiscernible as far as the lending side so i mean really that billion is a reference point we could use russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thats helpful vince thank you and then just a followup to the nii guide you mentioned the slight stepdown due to higher deposit beta assumptions have you guys quantified what you think the deposit beta through the cycle will be has that increased can you put a target on the vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah no we have our quarterly target in the slides i would say that so far just to remind everybody as we have on the slide our cumulative beta for total deposits was at the end of the quarter we had guided to so pretty close to that and it was remember at the end of the year so as we look ahead were projecting kind of mid total deposit betas at the end of the second quarter and while the end of the year feels very far away i mean our current thoughts and ill call them thoughts for year one would be kind of low for total deposits as far as the cumulative beta through the end of this year russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc thats great okay vince i appreciate that last one for me gary you guys have been conservative and derisked the portfolio in a couple of ways over the past two to three years do you see any opportunity or appetite for further derisking as you look out into the environment ahead gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania as we look at the portfolio today russell naturally there are softer economic times ahead were not looking at any significant derisking at all at the moment because were pleased with the position of the portfolio but naturally were extremely cautious on the office sector as we have been for quite some time now and we continue to review that book on a loan by loan basis so well in the normal course of business potentially move an asset or two or small segment of them but we have nothing teed up at this point russell e t gunther q analyst stephens inc all right thanks guys thank you all for taking my question vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you very much gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania sure operator the next question comes from brian martin with janney please go ahead fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys id say most of my stuff has just been answered but just a couple of things maybe vince calabrese just on the margin i mean i guess can you talk about where the march margin was kind of with the steps you talked about a little bit about liquidity just kind of whats the starting point if you will for next quarter vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah the march margin brian was million kind of our entry point into the second quarter brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and just kind of the puts and takes from here i guess as you look into kind of what the guide youve given vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i guess one thing too to point out thats important is with the excess cash that we have the additional liquidity that we grabbed the billion that obviously affects that ratio right so the net interest income comes down a little bit the ratio gets affected by that kind of excess liquidity position of what was there im sorry say what was your second question again brian brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah no i was just saying just to kind of think about that margin the stepping point into the next quarter million is kind of the starting point just is it tied to the guidance is your expectation that that margin percentage is relatively flat from here or just i know you talked about with rates being down you could see a little bit of a benefit but just nearterm in the next quarter or two vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think indiscernible net interest income i mean it comes down a little bit from here and then we build into the third and fourth quarter kind of given our earning asset growth as we move into the third and fourth quarter i mean the margins fluctuates a lot and with the noise in the balance sheet its just harder to talk to the margin piece brian but the net interest income brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yes indiscernible brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 okay and as far as just that excess liquidity vince i mean whats the plan i guess how long do you plan i guess do you just plan to keep that for a bit while some of it exit or just how are you thinking about that vince vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania well thats what i was saying a third of it is kind of six months or less and then a third is one year a third is two years so we just let that were not going to prepay it just let that naturally kind of get absorbed as it meets with time brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay i missed that part so all right and then just the pipelines the loan pipelines in the quarter i missed what you guys said there on the commercial side maybe it was vince as far as where theyre at or just kind of how theyre trending here vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania well i think the pipelines are a little softer than theyve been historically at the same time i dont think that were out as aggressively knocking on doors and i think that the demand has fallen off a little bit kind of unilaterally kind of across the board i will tell you that the shortterm pipelines look pretty decent our days we measure at days and then beyond that beyond days looks a little softer the 90day pipeline looks a little more solid theres a higher percentage of funding coming through in that pipeline which means theres less junk ending up and people are a little more focused so its a mixed bag as ive looked across all of the markets some of the markets in carolina are down some have better pipelines south carolina looks pretty good charlotte looks good short term and is probably building their longterm pipeline cleveland and pittsburgh are doing okay so its kind of all over the board which tells me theres a lot of caution out there in the customer base so its not us its not due to a lack of effort on the calling side i think its more about what the client is doing and theres less demand from our existing customers for capex spend at this stage in the cycle which is probably a good thing right so a little more caution in the portfolio what were also seeing is utilization rates are flat no one asked that questions ph or offer them i think basically as we look at the ci book and gary you can chime in if you like to but i think a lot of our customers have not been building inventories theyve actually been leaving inventory and moving their short term assets to cash as we move into a slower economic period so were starting to see reductions in loan balances and i think after the disruption that occurred in the banking industry a number of companies it gave them a heightened awareness about where they are and they took cash and basically paid down revolver debt because theyre paying a much higher interest rate than theyre receiving so a lot of thats going on over the last few months and its a little hard to forecast out through the end of the year but i would expect us to be more in line with our guide but its going to be a fight to get there right gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i would fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania go ahead gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania i would agree with the customers position on managing inventory downward were pretty much seeing that across the board naturally they built up some inventory during the supply chain issues theyve moved through some of that and with caution ahead from an economic standpoint and then potentially slowed down there they are very focused on their inventory positions and i would expect that to continue to move down as we go forward brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc perfect thank you for all the color and just on the new origination yields just i dont know if gary or whomever but just kind of where are those at today on the loan front indiscernible vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania sorry gary gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania no go ahead go ahead go ahead vince you got the specific numbers i mean i have generalities vincent j calabrese a chief financial officer fnb corp pennsylvania i can make a high level comment gary and then any color you want to add the new balance made during the first quarter came on at million but for comparison that was million in the fourth quarter and thats total total new loans brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect and maybe gary just you mentioned earlier on the call just the criticized level did you say that that was up modestly in the quarter i think you said down yearoveryear or do i have that wrong as far as whats criticized assets did gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania it was up basis points quarteroverquarter brian down basis points on a yearoveryear basis with a billion larger balance sheet so theyre at near low record levels from a criticized standpoint still today brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 okay and just the increase was there anything specific that kind of drove the increase or is it just a lot of things in there just anything you would point to given all the things youve all the disclosures youve added on credit gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah not really it was it was kind of just general brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania nothing specific brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and just the last one for me was on the capital markets revenue i think you talked about syndications being a little bit lower just any thoughts on just how that i guess the expectation would be that you see a little bit of volatility in that but it should trend higher as you go throughout the year vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah i think if you look at how we performed this quarter its pretty consistent with a less robust its kind of more baseline performance right brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania so i think that will all depends on how everything shakes out as we move forward i mean obviously on the structural side of syndications if were ph leading and less leading its going to depend on capex need ma activity theres a bunch of factors that go into driving fee income in that category i would expect some things to come up over the next few quarters that will benefit that area because we do have a fairly significant calling effort audio gap syndication side and then i would also expect derivatives as we move through the cycle and you see a number of companies burned through their own fixed rate program i would expect to see them reupping particularly with the inversion in the yield curve so i mean theres hope that we can sustain or grow those numbers i think thats reflected in our guide so i actually thought they did pretty well in the first quarter which is typically seasonally lower brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah fnb corp pennsylvania fnb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible i think were good from a wealth perspective were doing extraordinarily well producing net asset values and growing net asset values supplying the southeast in particular in intermittent lending so i would expect that to continue because we ph beat up staffing down there over the last few years and have better penetration so im expecting that to do a little better than previous years in terms of organic growth that should help us in the long run and then mortgage theres quite a bit of uncertainty about where were headed from a gain on sale perspective because of where rates are but again we were new to many of the markets we have great people great originators and were spread across a pretty vast geography with diversification with lower relative share in many markets so we should be able to sustain that so we feel pretty good about our guide in that indiscernible brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah no thats all understood okay well thank you for taking the questions and thanks for all the added disclosures on the office book and the cre book its very helpful vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania yeah thank you thank you brian gary l guerrieri a chief credit officer fnb corp pennsylvania thanks brian vincent j delie jr a chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania indiscernible questions vincent j delie jr chairman president chief executive officer fnb corp pennsylvania that concludes the yeah i think that concludes the question so i want to thank everybody for participating thank you for your thoughtful questions very detailed and hopefully we were able to answer we put out quite a bit so id recommend reading through the disclosures that we put out and thought our team did an excellent job getting the information out to the street id like to thank
