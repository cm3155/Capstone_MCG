before we discuss the third quarters results id like to begin with purpose on slide as you all know truist is a purposedriven company were dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities its the foundation for everything we do and the belief in this mission has never been more important given the extraordinary start to the fourth quarter with two devastating hurricanes in the days since these storms cut a path through the southeast truists humanitarian aid team and hundreds of teammate volunteers have been out in force to help our communities ive spent time in recent days with teammates in some of the hardesthit areas these teammates are doing just incredible heroic work helping their neighbors distributing critical supplies and making sure truist facilities were open to serve our clients even as their own lives have been upended in addition to contributions from the foundation weve set up several sites where weve distributed supplies weve also deployed mobile services for basic needs like showers and laundry facilities as well as mobile branches atms and generators to serve clients in areas without power this recovery is going to take time and were going to play a significant role in helping these communities recover and rebuild in the days weeks months and even years to come they can count on truist okay lets turn to discussing our thirdquarter results on slide weve made demonstrable progress on our strategic priorities during the quarter and im proud of the results our teammates delivered which included solid underlying earnings improved momentum and sound asset quality metrics on a gaap basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of billion or a share adjusted eps was per share which excluded a few small discrete items that mike will discuss later in the call as you can see on the slide our solid performance was defined by several key themes first we grew adjusted revenue on a linkedquarter basis due to another strong quarter of investment banking and trading income and a full quarters impact of the balance sheet reposition we completed during the second quarter second our results show our continued expense discipline and focus on managing cost as a result of these efforts our efficiency ratio improved on both a linked and likequarter basis adjusted expenses increased by less than linked quarter and declined for the third consecutive quarter on a yearoveryear basis expenses are now projected to decline in compared to which is an improvement from our original commitment to keep expenses flat for the year nonperforming loans remained relatively stable while net chargeoffs were better than our expectations we did record a million loan loss provision during the quarter specifically related to hurricane helene which mike will discuss in more detail later we also returned billion worth of capital to our shareholders through our common dividend and repurchased a million worth of common stock as part of the billion repurchase plan our board approved in late june we anticipate repurchasing another million of our common stock in the fourth quarter our cet1 capital ratio remained relatively stable leaving us well positioned to grow our balance sheet and to continue to return significant amount of capital to shareholders finally we continue to actively pursue growth opportunities in our core consumer small business and wholesale banking businesses although average loans declined during the quarter im encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of increased loan production greater wallet share within certain businesses and the talent were attracting to our company all while continuing to maintain our expense discipline and investing in important areas like technology and our risk infrastructure maintaining this momentum and continuing to execute against our strategic growth priorities will be key to reaching our midteens mediumterm roatce target which we also announced during the quarter truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 before i hand the call over to mike to discuss the quarterly results i want to spend a little time reviewing the positive momentum were seeing within business segments and within our digital initiatives on slides and in consumer small business banking im encouraged by the momentum as we experienced an increase in loan production in key focus areas within our lending portfolio and we continued to acquire new clients and households through both digital and traditional channels average consumer loan balance remained relatively stable linkedquarter as growth in other consumer which includes our specialty consumer lending verticals was offset by lower residential mortgage and home equity loans we did experience a linkedquarter increase in consumer loan production driven by nonreal estate lending which drove periodend indirect auto and other consumer balances each higher by on a linkedquarter basis importantly were not sacrificing our credit standards or pricing discipline to drive growth credit metrics remained relatively stable and new consumer loan production spreads are accretive to the portfolio although overall deposit growth remains muted were continuing to add new clients and households we opened nearly new digital loan and deposit accounts during the quarter including over newtobank clients through our digital channels which represents a increase over the third quarter of last year net new checking account growth was once again positive in the third quarter as we grew new consumer and business accounts bringing our total to yeartodate not only are we adding new households but primacy rates and client retention also continue to increase due to improvements to the client experience as we rolled out more than enhancements to our digital experience during the quarter in wholesale im encouraged by the underlying momentum in terms of improved production increased wallet share within certain businesses and the talent were attracting to our company during the quarter we saw growth in commercial deposits and a increase in wholesale lending production which was offset by lower line utilization and higher paydowns due in part to greater capital markets activity which is an area where we have invested consistently the third quarter represents the strongest capital markets quarter weve reported since as investment banking revenues increased yearoveryear and yeartodate we experienced record quarterly performance in equity capital markets investmentgrade issuance public finance and asset securitization the growth is tied to our focus on gaining greater mindshare with our clients across our industry verticals which has led to an increase in the number of lead roles across several product lines were continuing to invest in our wholesale platform as weve made several key new hires this quarter in commercial banking corporate banking investment banking wealth and payments and plan to add additional talent in the fourth quarter and beyond these new teammates complement our great existing teams and have significant experience in many cases from larger institutions and are attracted to our resultsoriented culture as i mentioned last quarter we have a specific focus on further building out our middlemarket commercial lending segment which represents one of the largest growth opportunities within our regional businesses well primarily focus on industries that support existing corporate investment banking coverage and expertise where weve gained significant share we also continue to enhance our wholesale digital capabilities by improving the client experience during the quarter we launched several significant enhancements to the truist one view platform including the ability for clients to securely chat directly with treasury management specialists enhancing the client experience and growing our digital capabilities are important parts of our strategy which ill discuss in more detail on slide we continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities as client mobile app users grew and digital transactions increased compared to the third quarter of we continue to migrate clients towards selfservice capabilities primarily driven by strong growth in zelle transactions which are up yearoveryear truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 in addition to an increase in account openings were also seeing an improvement in the funding of our digital account openings with balances up significantly over the third quarter of last year a recently enhanced digital deposit application experience has helped drive a increase in mobile device applications which now account for of total digital applications these improvements also drove a 500basispoint linkedquarter increase in the conversion rate on new digital applications driving productivity and leading strong digital client satisfaction scores were not only better serving and growing with our clients but were also doing that more efficiently so now let me turn it over to mike to discuss the financial results and ill come back after that and close us out michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone as a highlevel summary we reported third quarter gaap net income available to common shareholders of billion or per share our adjusted eps was per share which included a million pretax or per share aftertax increase to the gain on sale of truist insurance holdings and a million pretax or another per share aftertax reduction on the fdic special assessment total revenue adjusted for the losses on the availableforsale investment securities that were sold in the second quarter increased by linked quarter due to a increase in net interest income and growth in noninterest income driven primarily by growth in investment banking and trading revenue adjusted expenses increased linked quarter but were down approximately on a likequarter basis reflecting lower personnel costs moving on to capital our cet1 ratio remained relatively stable linked quarter at as currentperiod earnings and a smaller balance sheet were offset by the payment of our common dividend and share repurchases completed during the quarter from a credit perspective net chargeoffs declined by basis points on a linked quarter basis and our nonperforming loans remained relatively stable both on a like and linkedquarter basis next getting into additional detail ill cover loans and leases on slide average loans decreased billion or on a sequential basis reflecting overall weaker commercial client demand and line utilization partially offset by modest growth in consumer loans average commercial loans decreased by billion or primarily due to a decline in ci balances driven again by lower line utilization and at least in part by greater capital markets activity in our consumer portfolio average loans remained relatively stable linked quarter as growth in indirect auto and service finance was offset with lower residential mortgage loans as bill mentioned production improved in both consumer and wholesale lending but paydowns and runoff in certain categories like commercial and residential real estate will likely result in continued pressure on an average balance basis in the fourth quarter likely similar to the rate of decline that we experienced in the third quarter moving to deposit trends on slide average deposits decreased sequentially or billion with approximately billion of the decline due to lowered brokered deposits average noninterestbearing deposits decreased and represented of total deposits which is unchanged versus the second quarter of the billion decline in average brokered deposits reduced our total and interestbearing deposit costs by basis point sequentially to and respectively overall we expect deposit balances to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide sic taxable equivalent net interest income increased linked quarter or million primarily due to the strategic balance sheet repositioning we completed during the second quarter a reduction in highercost wholesale funding and the impact of one additional day in the third quarter these tailwinds were partially offset by the impact of additional receive fixed interest rate swaps that became effective during the quarter and by lower commercial loan balances reported truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 net interest margin increased basis points on a linkedquarter basis to due primarily to the securities repositioning i just mentioned and a reduction in highercost wholesale funding returning to noninterest income on slide adjusted noninterest income increased million or relative to the second quarter the linkedquarter increase was primarily attributable to higher other income and higher investment banking and trading income which improved million due to higher ma equity capital markets and investmentgrade fees adjusted noninterest income increased on a likequarter basis due to higher investment banking and trading income and higher service charge on deposit income next ill cover noninterest expense on slide gaap expenses of billion decreased million linked quarter primarily due to lower other expenses as the second quarter included a million charitable donation regulatory costs decreased by million partially due to a million reduction on the fdic special assessment which was recognized in adjusted noninterest expense increased sequentially due to higher professional fees other and marketing expense partially offset by lower personnel expense on a like quarter basis adjusted expenses declined by million or reflecting lower personnel and other expenses now moving to asset quality on slide asset quality remains stable on both a like and linkedquarter basis reflecting our strong credit risk culture and proactive approach to quickly resolving problem loans during the quarter our net chargeoff ratio decreased basis points to basis points due primarily to lower losses in our cre portfolio our loan loss provision remained relatively stable linked quarter and includes a million provision related to hurricane helene the provision exceeded net chargeoffs to the fourth quarter which along with lower loan balances resulted in a basis point increase in our alll ratio to nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans remained relatively stable for the fourth consecutive quarter while total delinquencies were also flat on a linkedquarter basis included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio which is down million linked quarter to of total loans our office reserve increased from to driven by continued expected stress in the office sector approximately of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming compared with at june approximately of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan notably approximately of our office portfolio is housed within our commercial community banking and wealth segments where loan sizes tend to be more granular guarantor support more prevalent and overall loss is lower we expect stress to remain in the office sector and believe that the size of our portfolio is manageable and well reserved but our position is to be very proactive in identifying and resolving issues in this portfolio turning to capital on slide truists cet1 ratio remained relatively stable linked quarter at as current period earnings were offset by the return of billion in capital to shareholders via our common stock dividend and the repurchase of million of our shares our cet1 capital ratio including the impact of aoci increased from to reflecting a billion linkedquarter improvement in aoci due to the decline in longerterm interest rates experienced during the quarter although we await the final proposal for the basel iii endgame rules we believe that our current strong capital position gives us the unique ability to utilize our future earnings and aoci accretion to fund balance sheet growth and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders i will now review our updated guidance on slide looking into the fourth quarter of we expect revenue to decrease from the third quarter adjusted revenue of billion we expect net interest income to decrease in the fourth quarter primarily driven by lower commercial loan balances and some pressure to our net interest margin due to the temporary lag in our deposit beta our net interest income outlook assumes two 25basispoint reductions in the federal funds rate over the remainder of one cut in november and another cut in december we expect noninterest income to decline by driven primarily by lower investment banking truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 and trading revenue as the third quarter performance was helped by some pullforward of capital markets activity from the fourth into the third quarter adjusted expenses of billion in the third quarter are expected to increase in the third quarter driven by investments in areas such as talent our digital platforms marketing and risk infrastructure for the full year consistent with our previous guidance we expect revenues to be down to down which reflects our updated outlook for the fourth quarter as bill mentioned we now expect full year adjusted expenses to be slightly lower than adjusted expenses versus our previous expectation for expenses to remain approximately flat in terms of asset quality we previously expected net chargeoffs of about basis points for full year we would now expect net chargeoffs to be closer to basis points in as it relates to buybacks similar to the third quarter we are targeting approximately million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter finally we expect our effective tax rate to approximate or on a taxable equivalent basis in the fourth quarter of i will now hand it back to bill for some final remarks william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thank you mike so in conclusion im really pleased with the progress weve made as a company this year and im confident that weve got tremendous momentum within our company with our clients and with our teammates as our value proposition has never been stronger first weve got an incredible franchise with leading share in highgrowth markets weve got highly motivated and energized teammates we have a fulsome set of specialized wholesale and consumer capabilities that our loyal clients value our relative capital advantage is a differentiating factor that gives us a unique ability to grow our core banking businesses by serving existing and new clients invest in our infrastructure and return considerable amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the next several years as we execute our strategic growth and capital management priorities we see a significant opportunity to improve our profitability over the medium term our path to profitability improvement is multifaceted and a function of client and business growth while maintaining our cost discipline i can say that im encouraged that much of the profitability improvement potential were working towards is centered on further deepening of existing client relationships in verticals and product lines that already exist at truist the good news is we see multiple paths and initiatives that with proper execution will result in improved performance while we dont have to experiment with new products or expand into new markets to achieve our goals we plan to accomplish all of this while maintaining our expense discipline and focus on generating positive longterm operating leverage while also continue to invest in talent technology and our infrastructure although its too early to provide specific earnings guidance for based on the current momentum the confidence in our teams and our franchise where we are in the planning cycle we do expect to achieve positive operating leverage next year finally well never take for granted our strong track record on asset quality as we continue to focus on maintaining strong risk discipline and controls im as optimistic as ever about truists future especially in light of the success i see every day inside our company id like to thank all of our teammates and all of our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity in moving our company forward again thank you for your interest and investment in truist and with that brad let me turn it back over to you for qa truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 brad milsaps headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you bill betsy at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one followup in order that we may accommodate as many of you on the call today as possible question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question today comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you for taking the question mike was hoping you could please maybe unpack the fourthquarter margin guidance a bit more for overall nii i certainly understand the ongoing pressure on loans but was hoping you might be able to sort of walk through thoughts on how quickly deposit betas might be able to catch up to help support or ideally enhance the margin and then just make some toplevel thoughts about the companys overall rate sensitivity at this point michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah good morning scott happy to do that from a nim perspective maybe just to sort of start with the third quarter and give you the trends into the fourth and maybe even give you a sense for kind of where we go from there and ill link that to the beta the bulk of the improvement that we saw in the third quarter was really driven by the repositioning so the basis points from to as you look into the fourth quarter we mentioned the temporary beta lag we do expect two cuts in the fourth we did see some improvement in the third youll recall we were better by basis point on call it an average funds rate that was better by basis points for the quarter so it started at call it a beta our outlook for the fourth quarter is that while well accelerate significantly call it into the mid maybe even high from a beta perspective thatll still lag a touch relative to how quickly the assets are repricing so we see some margin compression there maybe its to the same tune as we guided nii so call it or so of net interest margin down into the sort of low area we would expect that to catch up very very early probably in the first quarter of and would expect to see the margin stabilize id say in the first quarter and then begin to improve as we have further cuts as we get into r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thats great color and thank you and then just wanted to ask separately so you did the really large balance sheet repositioning earlier this year ive gotten the impression that that was sort of all you planned there but you have so much capital flexibility relative to so many banks out there any thoughts on further opportunities to do so or is it sort of stand pat on that front truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i mean look i think youre right we feel like we took a pretty big swing at this in may have now fully realized at least the benefit into the run rate in the third quarter we do think that our capital position is an advantage were trying to be patient very focused on growing the business bills talked a lot about the various initiatives in both of our business segments where we do think were going to have an opportunity to grow footings and leverage capital obviously as thats been a little slower to develop were buying back shares at an elevated level i think we would expect to continue buying back shares at an elevated level i think the repositioning incrementally i dont think we want to ever put the tool back in the toolbox necessarily but i think its a lower priority for us based on what else we see in front of us r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah got it all right thank you very much appreciate it operator the next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp betsy brad milsaps a headinvestor relations truist financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc bill you mentioned with proper execution deliver on the goals here the targets that you have could you help us understand what do you mean by proper execution is that just hitting the goals or is there a change in how youre operating that delivers proper execution william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean betsy theres a real strong focus on expanding our relationships with our existing clients im really pleased with the momentum weve created in the execution coming out of the merger there was a lot of diversion and a lot of focus on activities of getting clients converted and getting teammates onboarded and all those type things and thats just way behind us and now the teams really focused on executing against our priorities weve got a really strong focus and clarity about what we want to accomplish so when i say proper execution maybe i should better have said continuation of the execution momentum that weve started and you see some of that in this quarter you see increase in primacy rates you see that continuation of net new so all these things that are demonstrable evidence of the fact that were continuing to expand and grow our truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 relationships with our clients so proper probably ought to be continuation and improved momentum against existing execution betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then as were thinking about the positive operating leverage into how much of that is being driven by deposit beta lags catching up here with fed funds i mean is that the major driver of how were thinking about operating leverage as we roll into william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well youve got all the factors that come into it so first is the momentum of the business that we have so take investment banking lets use that as one example the momentum we have in this quarter continuing that type of momentum into next year as an example the loan growth activity is going to i think were confident its going to return we saw production increases this quarter particularly on the consumer side we saw loan production up around we saw real increases in the areas that we can lean into think about the things you know about like service finance and sheffield so we saw really good momentum there increase in production on the wholesale side but the utilization was the lowest this quarter its been in the last five quarters so but we expect to see some of that return so weve got some loan dependencies weve got some executional dependencies some fee dependencies and then as you mentioned the deposit beta and im really pleased with the team i mean mike and team have provided really great leadership working really closely with kristin and dontá on the businesses to really be on top of where we are from deposit betas and mike indicated weve already had a little bit of movement we expect a little bit of lag but sort of see that transitioning in the first quarter of next year and then continuing from there and then the final factor is the expense side so the other side of that is controlling expenses and hopefully were giving good evidence to the fact that weve got a good handle on our expenses were going to be down this year versus last year and i think weve got a really good capacity to correlate our expense growth with our revenue growth opportunities so its a lot of things maybe its a long answer to a short question but all of those things i think have the requisite amount of focus and attention and we dont have a single dependency were going to manage them all really tightly and really well with a focus on achieving that positive operating leverage betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much operator the next question comes from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning brad milsaps a headinvestor relations truist financial corp good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc morning my first question is a followup mike you mentioned a little bit of guidance on the fourth quarter as we think about the trajectory from here and fully appreciate were not getting specific color today as we think about the structure of your asset side versus your liability side should we assume that from that level your assets can start repricing faster than liabilities in but then theres a daycount impact on nii thats negative or will the assets repricing faster than liabilities go come later and to that end you mentioned the swaps if you could give us a little bit more color on the swaps what the notional active is what the weighted receive fixed rate is so we can factor that into our modeling michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah sure good morning erika as it relates to the i call it just maybe the nim trajectory i think youve got it right well actually let me say this so we do expect in the fourth quarter for the beta to accelerate i mentioned call it midhigh we would expect that to continue and essentially catch up in the first quarter so at that point we would expect to actually have the balance sheet behaving a touch liability sensitive again after an assetsensitive fourth quarter and so really as we move deeper into again a lot of variables here we would expect the net interest margin to begin to expand a touch so thats a good guide and i think you mentioned day count im glad you brought that up there are two fewer days in the first quarter so as you think about actual nii dollars while we might see a more stable earning asset base in the first we might see a more stable net interest margin you might still feel a touch of pressure from the dollars of nii perspective i think i got most of your questions and on the swaps lets see we did as you know well we have two programs that we use to manage our rate position weve got our receive fixed program which we primarily rely on to manage our nii sensitivity and risks and opportunities and we have our pay fixed program to manage our asset values manage our capital volatility risk in the future aoci etcetera we did have some activity in the positions during the quarter we added about give or take billion dollars of forward starting receivers during the third quarter that takes notional up into the call it 60orsobilliondollar area we also added about billion of pay fixed swaps we added to the investment portfolio during the quarter as well so had some accompanied activity there in terms of active versus sort of forward starting we did have i mentioned in our nii results sort of description we had a touch of a headwind in the third versus the second quarter based on about billion of incremental receive fixed swaps becoming active during the quarter that was a manageable headwind as we look at the fourth quarter we really dont have much else coming on throughout the course of the year we will have more active in but thats going to come on frankly who knows the curve could change but based on the curve that we see today thats going to come on and actually be less of a headwind each quarter into our receive fixed rate you asked erika is around on that notional erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question and thanks for all the detail is for bill based on what mike just said you should have nii growth next year if everything is supposed to come true that the markets thinking in terms of capital market strength in youll benefit from that as you did this quarter if the market is good volatile as it could be after an election and a change in administration that could be good for your wealth management business as well so as we think about truist on offense and fully appreciate that youre aiming for positive truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operating leverage are you thinking about your expense base really just more relative to that potential revenue strength in in other words should we think about truist as truist on offense rather than oh because of this and that we have to think about managing expenses because of all the issues with the merger integration so i wanted to get your thoughts there and additionally some longerterm investors have asked me why will truist operate in the midteens in terms of roatce if their two super regional peers are aiming to earn in the high teens or the mid to high teens and i suspect that might be a capital adjustment i know thats a compound question but i wanted to get your thoughts on both thank you so much william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah thanks for the comprehensive questions i think youve characterized the first part of that question exactly right in the sense that we are on offense and you can feel it in our company you can feel it in the results you can see it in the things that we talked about in terms of this third quarter and you outlined many of those in terms of momentum we think about the expense side and this is the concept that i talked about our commitment to long term operating leverage is the expenses are correlate to that opportunity and i think today weve got the calibration correlated i think as you noted it was sort of uncorrelated as we were coming out of the merger and today i think weve got a really good handle on the capacity to invest and win and grow and be on offense and have those be correlated again you saw good evidence of that in this quarter so there isnt a merger hangover or other activity related to the expenses weve been investing were going to continue to invest and we see the results of that in our top line revenue growth and opportunity so again higher correlated and commitment to have an efficient company so were operating today at a really much stronger efficiency ratio so we didnt talk about that so this commitment to have positive operating leverage on the platform of a really efficient company so lets put that in one category and then on the roatce side i think you highlighted sort of the starting point is a little bit different right because of the sale of the insurance business and the creation of a lot of capital should we start sort of from a different framework i think about it as the speed in increase in terms of return so our speed of increase and return i think is unparalleled so where we start from our ability to deploy capital both in growing our business and returning capital to our shareholders i think has us the capacity to grow our roatce faster than anybody else and then once we get to that midteens sort of level then and our business model starts to reflect more of what we talked about in the first part of my answer then i think we sort of catapult from there but the key is we have the most ability to grow our return over the medium term hope that answers it erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc helpful thank you so much william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes perfect truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess maybe just the first question and apologies if i missed it i think you mentioned pace of buybacks relative to billion this quarter should we is there room or are you thinking about increasing the pace of those buybacks in the near term if loan growth is muted or should we assume that the million is relatively locked in for the next several quarters william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah this is bill so i think we ought to think about it as its going to stay at an elevated level for some period of time weve been very clear that we see opportunities to grow our business so were going to make sure that weve got ample capital to do that and invest in the growth if we see that as being much longer than sort of our current view we have the opportunity to recalibrate or to stay at elevated levels longer or to increase those elevated levels but for now i think and so we talked about the fourth quarter and how we would enter the first part of next year were entering that with a lot of confidence in the ability to grow our business ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just on that i think you responded slightly to betsys question earlier if you think from an outside standpoint and you mentioned that truist is now all like done with the overhang with the deal just remind us bill when we think about the momentum and growth where across the businesses do you expect to grow market share and do you feel like youre at a point where the bank will stop bleeding market share to smaller or outofmarket competitors whove been aggressive in terms of hiring across the southeast thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean lets talk about market share in terms of all of our businesses so starting with the investment banking side weve increased market share consistently through this year in virtually every discipline so on the margin increase share in every discipline and then when i think about share i think about the things that we talked about in terms of for example net new weve really had a really strong focus on net new growth so when i think about share its growing share with clients so increasing the number of net new clients and thats sort of an incredible hallmark and then when i think about share its primacy within our existing client base so are we growing our primacy in terms of our share and this quarter particularly both on the wholesale side in terms of treasury penetration and on the consumer side in terms of product penetration we grew primacy with all of our clients so yes we have a lot of new clients coming into our markets i mean a lot of new competitors coming into our markets because we have great markets but our primacy and our net new and our capacity to serve our clients and grow in our share as we look at the important parts of share i feel really really comfortable with and thats going to continue so that pace is granted started slower out of the merger but now is at a really good pace and i expect that to continue ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted thanks bill truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operator the next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning brad milsaps a headinvestor relations truist financial corp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc bill can we get more meat on the bones for the financial expectations in and beyond such as the definition of long term when you talk about operating leverage in are you talking about more than give some kind of level the term medium term when you talk about returns what year are you thinking and the reason i ask is im trying to better understand the accountability of management to shareholders and ive written about this but in the third quarter you lowered the return targets from when it was low to midteens at the same time you granted a special extra leadership bonus award to some executive officers and that was on top of awards they already get psus rsus ltip annual incentive awards and for what looks like fixing a problem that truist caused the asset liability management pre the current cfo and then theres the question about morale for those who didnt get the award i mean two of the five named executive officers i recognize bill you did not get that award but theres others in the 24member operating committee who i assume did not get that so aside from the morale and reconciling pay with performance im just looking at todays slides and i dont see the word shareholders when you say on the slide that says mission on the slide that says why truist and you have taken some steps you restructured the board the balance sheet you reordered the company you sold tih you cut expenses but still shareholders the stocks underperformed is the bottom line stocks underperformed over most time frames since you announced the merger so again thats my big teeup can you give us more detail on financial expectations after the fourth quarter and the key metrics that you think should drive a higher stock price thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp sure thanks mike and thanks for acknowledging the efforts that have been underway let me first say as it relates to the deck every slides about shareholders so i just want to be really really clear about that everything we do is about shareholders so that is all in context as it relates to the rotce specifically i would say what we do we did as reset sort of post the sale of tih so it was appropriate to sort of reset the return post tih because we generate a lot of capital and we change the construct of our business in terms of return we created a significant amount of capital so that actually lowers the return to create that capital but as we deploy that capital we increase that return and i think as i said earlier to an answer i think our capacity to increase that return is were in the best position of anybody because weve got that capital and that capacity to deploy it quickly both in our business and as a return to our shareholders so we raised it efficiently and i think we have a chance to deploy it and return it efficiently in terms of the elements that are part of that return hopefully those are many things that ive talked about and focused on things that are critical to expanding relationships with existing clients in markets and places where we truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 already have committed capital and resources so these are things that have higher returns and faster paybacks so if you think about our strategy its not focused on these longterm paybacks and going to markets and trying new things this is about really executing against the opportunities that we have in our existing franchise and increasing that return faster with higher paybacks when i talk about medium term the definition of that is somewhere in that threeyear kind of range but that also depends on sort of where the economy is and what we see in terms of growth and what we see in terms of rates so that could go faster that could go slower but the key is well have momentum against that and again i think you see that in this quarter i think youll continue to see that well use the capital as an answer to the earlier question well use the capital as a lever so we can return that capital in many ways to the shareholders all of which will increase returns i think faster than others are capable of doing i have tremendous confidence in our team again i think you see evidence of many of that and then as it relates to the operating leverage we said let us get into the year a little bit more let us sort of see where things are coming in terms of where rates are going and where we see asset growth but that commitment to positive operating leverage is a continuous one so i think well make that transition next year as i said earlier and then well continue to improve on that transition yearoveryear as the returns improve to the earlier part of my answer mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just a followup to the incentives for management i think you changed i cut off with the page of the proxy last night thats what you do if youre a bank analyst for a long time and im just trying and i also saw the release that you had this quarter or in third quarter and it looks like theres like financial metrics and then five nonfinancial metrics and theres so many different metrics that driving compensation if you had to pick one or two key metrics that we on the outside can monitor and focus on that should drive shareholder value what should they be william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean appreciate you diving into the proxy i think as you dive into that proxy youll see compensation based on performance so i think youll see that actually quite clearly so dont assume that we dont have that mentality at this company and i think the primary measures that we look at are rotce and growth in our business so you have to have really good return and you have to have growth so were looking at total book value per share plus dividends plus rotce so total absolute growth and total relative return growth mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and i think those in fairness are the highest correlated to share price return mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 operator the next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right good morning in the prepared remarks you guys mentioned about increasing in the fourth quarter investments related to risk infrastructure i was just wondering if you could elaborate on what that is and the drivers of i guess why now william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean matt thats a continuation of the investments that we have in the risk infrastructure so thats everything you can think of in terms of how we build a more enduring consistent infrastructure so think about the investments in cyber think about the investments in data all the type things that go along with that investment theyre bumpy by quarter but they are increasing and part of our overall guidance and so in the fourth quarter we just had some specific items that were more unique to that quarter but theyre also factored into the guidance that weve given on positive operating leverage for next year were going to continue to invest in infrastructure this isnt a onetime unusual thing this is a continuous investment for a company our size with the responsibilities and the obligations we have to our clients regulators and our shareholders matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i know when you combined the two companies you guys made a lot of investments in call it the ph guts to the company taking the best of both and creating some new platforms maybe just like give us a quick snapshot of like what is there still to do like is it catching up on something is it just kind of business as usual staying uptodate like all the other banks are doing william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i think in terms of basically the risk infrastructure i mean weve seen the elevation of expectations of how we manage data weve seen elevated expectations in ai and the investments that we want to make there weve seen elevated expectations in terms of cyber so there are many more not things that were left out of the merger but things that are just continuous improvement of what we want to do and be responsive to the opportunities and challenges that exist in financial services matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi bill hi mike william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us bill in your prepared remarks when you talked about market share in response to a question but you were talking about wallet share how in some of your businesses youre gaining wallet share can you share with us how can we as outsiders measure that success growing that wallet share and second what are you doing to grow that wallet share thats showing up that maybe you didnt see three or four years ago william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean the best way to see the wallet share gain is see it in the overall returns of our business so if you think about the return expectations and increasing rotce think about that for us as increasing roa think about that as the focus so we have assets deployed we have resources deployed and we increase the penetration this time we talked about checking primacy up we talked about treasury management penetration of our commercial base up so hopefully were giving you that kind of information thats consistent to demonstrate that primacy but you primarily see it in the returns so thats the focus i mean thats the big way we drive returns for this business is improving our primacy with our clients gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and following up on that primacy comment bill how do you guys intersect or interlock your pursuit of the digital channel with primacy it seems like the industry you guys included the optimal kind of mix is having physical branches as well as the digital channel do most of the primacy relationships still come through the brickand mortar or are you seeing some success in building it through the digital channel william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well youre really on it and the answer is both we have this concept called t3 so this concept of that touch and technology equals trust so what we want to do and the capability that weve built for example our clients in truist assist so our digital clients can have a virtual assistant to sort of help them in their transactions but what we believe is that they also have the opportunity to then transition to a human interaction with that so youve got to sort of supply both of those opportunities when a client is interacting with us digitally and shows up in our branch we want to be able to follow up on that transaction and continue that process so i think theyre actually both really important as part of the overall process it never becomes more clear in something like weve experienced in the last few weeks in the storms so those economies go to cash during that particular time so our branches and our atms are the most important thing that those communities need at that time they dont have access to digital internets down powers down so being able to toggle between both of those and making sure that we serve our clients in the way that they can be best be served thats why i led with that and this particular commentary is just to show how important both of those things are because the goal is to create an enduring relationship with a community and with a client and we do that by investing in the channels that are most important to them when theyre most important to them gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 appreciate that thank you bill operator this
