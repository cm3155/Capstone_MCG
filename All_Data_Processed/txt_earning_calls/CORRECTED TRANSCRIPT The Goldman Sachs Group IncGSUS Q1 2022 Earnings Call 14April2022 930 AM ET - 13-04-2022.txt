our website at wwwgscom no information on forwardlooking statements and nongaap measures appear on the earnings release and presentation this audiocast is copyrighted material of the goldman sachs group inc and may not be duplicated reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent i am joined by our chairman and chief executive officer david solomon and our chief financial officer denis coleman let me pass the call to david david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks carey good morning everyone thank you all for joining us this morning theres no question the first quarter was extremely volatile russia invaded ukraine inflation rose across the globe and we saw an accelerated trend towards deglobalization in recent decades we have grown used to low inflation low interest rates and the free flow of people and goods across national borders i believe were entering a period that that wont be the case and the consequences for financial markets will be meaningful although much remains uncertain im proud that goldman sachs effectively supported its clients in this type of environment this is a testament to the progress weve made and to our strategy around clients at a time of great volatility it was clear our clients needed help managing their risk and they turned to us for our expertise in navigating this changing landscape the recent turbulence is nothing to change our firms clientoriented strategy in fact it makes it all the more imperative we are building a more resilient diversified franchise that can generate solid returns even in more uncertain markets in february i laid out our revised mediumterm return target im very proud that even with the headwinds we faced our results this quarter meet those objectives we are also well positioned to achieve the targets we laid out for our growth initiatives across asset management wealth management transaction banking and consumer in some areas we have accelerated our progress via acquisitions including greensky which closed in late march and nnip which closed earlier this week im thrilled to be welcoming these great businesses to goldman sachs for the quarter we produced net revenues of billion and generated earnings per share of an roe of and an rote of as i noted the evolving market backdrop had a significant effect on client activity this meant that some parts of our firm faced significant headwinds like equity capital markets where issuance volumes were lackluster for the quarter the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 on the other hand global markets had a strong quarter as this environment allowed us to support clients in the risk intermediation and financing needs and in line with our strategy several of our growth areas continue to reflect durability despite the difficult environment for example we saw solid management and other fees across asset management and wealth management as well as revenue growth in our consumer business but theres no question that the most significant event of the first quarter was the invasion of ukraine as ive said before we condemn the invasion on the strongest possible terms and our hearts go out to the ukrainian people this act of aggression demands a response that goldman sachs is committed to doing its part early on we took action to ensure the wellbeing of our people and to begin winding down our firms operations in russia that process is ongoing let me also say a few words on our direct financial exposure to russia our positions were relatively limited but weve been focused on closing them out and reducing our exposure the overall direct financial impact from russia and ukrainerelated instruments on our first quarter revenues was a net loss of approximately million our risk mitigation efforts would not have been possible without the close collaboration of our people around the globe on both the business and the control side of our firm our risk management culture is a true differentiator for us and we continue to navigate as we continue to navigate this volatile environment more broadly the russian invasion has further complicated the geopolitical landscape and created an additional level of uncertainty that i expect will outlast the war itself while it is encouraging to see newfound unity among the western democracies the trend towards deglobalization is clearly gaining momentum the consequences of that shift are likely to be significant and longlasting and i believe it will take some time to fully appreciate all the second and thirdorder ramifications beyond geopolitics im keeping a close eye on several other trends while us unemployment levels are low and wages are increasing inflation is the highest its been in decades were seeing new stress on supply chains and commodity prices and us households are facing rising gas prices as well as higher prices for food and housing were also seeing an increased risk of stagflation and mixed signals on consumer confidence these crosscurrents will certainly create ongoing complexity in the economic outlook but whatever the future holds i believe goldman sachs is wellpositioned we continue to make progress on our growth strategy and our commitments to clients is strong our commitment to clients is stronger than ever ill now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the first quarter we generated net revenues of billion and net earnings of billion resulting in earnings per share of as david noted firmwide performance was strong with an roe of and rote of notwithstanding an operating environment that was significantly less favorable than the prior year turning to performance by segment starting on page investment banking generated revenues of billion financial advisory revenues were billion as our ma franchise continued its outstanding performance and client dialogue remained significantly elevated in the quarter we closed over deals for approximately the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 billion of deal volume and maintained our number one league table position with nearly billion in announced transactions this was roughly billion ahead of our next closest competitor the largest quarterly lead in our history as a public firm in equity underwriting net revenues were million down significantly versus a record performance in the first quarter of on the lower industry issuance volumes that david mentioned despite this we continue to rank number one yeartodate in equity and equityrelated offerings with volume market share of debt underwriting net revenues were million lower versus the prior year driven by lower results in leveraged finance and assetbacked activity while transactions have slowed from the elevated pace of last year and deals have been pushed out given the uncertain backdrop our investment banking backlog remains robust client engagement is strong catalyzed by secular trends like digital disruption and transformation across industries and future activity will likely be bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors moving to global markets on page segment net revenues were billion in the quarter up yearonyear we saw exceptional strength in both our ficc and equities business on page you can see revenues across ficc were billion in the first quarter higher than the strong results in the first quarter of ficc intermediation produced net revenues of billion this was driven by particular strength in our macro products with elevated activity across rates currencies and commodities these macro businesses within ficc which generally represent the preponderance of ficc intermediation revenues benefit from a portfolio effect our diversified and global footprint combined with our risk intermediation and execution capabilities is a key differentiator ficc financing generated record revenues of million which were up sequentially and yearon year with particular strength in mortgages total equities revenues were billion equities intermediation revenues fell yearoveryear driven by lower activity in both cash and derivatives due to fewer marketmaking opportunities compared to a very strong backdrop at the start of equity financing produced net revenues of million though lower on a yearonyear basis these results were higher sequentially while average prime balances declined slightly from record levels at yearend opportunities to provide client liquidity increased which drove stronger quarterly performance moving to asset management on page first quarter revenues were million materially lower than the first quarter of last year due to market headwinds in equity investments and lending and debt investments management and other fees totaled million up sequentially net revenues for equity investments were negative million across both our public and private portfolios we experienced substantial losses tied to russiarelated positions all of which have been written down to zero more broadly we experienced additional headwinds due to the overall market environment all in we experienced roughly million of net losses in our public portfolio offset by approximately million in net gains across our private portfolio largely due to eventdriven items including asset sales and financing rounds we harvested billion of onbalance sheet equity investments in the first quarter we remain fully committed to reducing this portfolio over time and have line of sight on another billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to approximately million of capital reduction the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 turning to page consumer wealth management produced revenues of billion in the first quarter up sequentially and yearoveryear in wealth management quarterly management and other fees were billion down versus the fourth quarter of on seasonality and counseling fees but up yearover year private banking and lending net revenues of million were up yearonyear driven by higher lending and deposit balances consumer banking revenues were million in the first quarter up sequentially and yearoveryear we continue to grow credit card loans and deposit balances next on page across these two segments total firmwide aus ended the quarter at trillion with a quarterly decline primarily driven by net market depreciation of billion partially offset by billion of long term net inflows combined firmwide management and other fees for the first quarter rose yearoveryear to billion driven by higher average aus versus last year on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion for the first quarter higher versus a year ago reflecting higher loan balances and lower funding costs our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion up billion versus yearend primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and credit cards for the first quarter our provision for credit losses was million up from million in the fourth quarter provisions in the quarter were primarily due to the growth in our lending portfolio as well as broader macroeconomic factors including a slowing growth outlook as we continue to expand our consumer business and grow our lending activities we are cognizant that macro headwinds and inflationary pressures could potentially weigh on payment rates and thus portfolio performance while we have not seen any meaningful signs of deterioration in credit metrics we are being vigilant and will continue to monitor performance and macro conditions to assess risk mitigation measures and calibrate our underwriting where needed turning to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses were billion down yearover year this drove an efficiency ratio for the quarter of our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion higher yearoveryear driven by our continued investments particularly in technology that will further enhance our infrastructure and support our strategic growth initiatives turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach in the quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of million and common stock dividends of roughly million as it relates to the second quarter we deployed capital to support the closing of the nnip transaction and we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment in conclusion our strong first quarter results reflect the durability and resilience of our client franchise across almost any environment despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical complexity we remain focused on executing on our strategic plan to diversify our business mix and drive competitive returns for shareholders and we have significant confidence in our forward momentum as an organization with that well now open the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much so i appreciate the billion harvesting out of the balance sheet pe and the other billion coming up so its a partial answer to the question but in the backdrop that weve seen with slowing ma and again almost no ipos my original question was going to be can you still get to that scb of thats so important to give us all confidence about putting up that to return over time how do you view that forward look of the march towards denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so glenn its denis thank you thank you for the question obviously our results in the quarter in terms of rote are and roe was our mediumterm targets that you referenced were to be achieved by so were really pleased with the performance in this quarter as it relates to the scb for us it continues to be making the choices that we can with respect to investing in our business mix creating more durable and predictable revenue streams and then also continuing to migrate down our onbalance sheet equity position so i think our commitment to the strategy remains intact we have obviously submitted our ccar submission and we await response from the federal reserve and we will continue to focus on driving those aspects of our business that we can all of which we hope will contribute to an scb that is lower and reflects our business mix glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay i appreciate that its working so far good first quarter maybe a little followup on the sponsor side and its both as you as someone thats planning to raise a lot of thirdparty money as an alternative management and also you as the largest servicer of that sponsor community can you give us a little insight towards just whats going on do you expect is the capital raising environment disrupted you harvested a billion but can you still have a decent harvesting backdrop amidst a disruptive banking backdrop thanks so much david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure glenn its david and ill jump in here i would say that there are a variety of secular tailwinds that are still driving lots of institutional capital on a global basis towards broad alternatives platforms i think despite the volatility that exists in markets those trends continue to be in place and i think youll continue to see secular growth in the amount of capital institutional capital thats allocated to alternatives platforms for quite some time in the context of that i think we and others who have deep broad multiproduct global platforms that are well positioned and so while the pace of fundraising might ebb and flow a little bit from peaks i think the general secular trend is still in place in this volatility i dont think in the short run will affect that with respect to monetizations and values theres no question that weve gone through a period of time where the macro backdrop certainly created an acceleration of that there were a variety of factors that i think were more the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 shortterm that amplified that and i think weve commented in the past about the fact that we did not think those levels of activity were sustainable however even in an environment like this when you have a broad diversified portfolio of assets and there are certainly lots of areas where theres real growth in the economy and the economy is still growing very well the opportunity to see monetizations to see transactions i think continues just probably not at the same pace and velocity as we saw in and operator your next question comes from the line of christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning so overall rote of was pretty impressive in the quarter given it was a pretty challenging backdrop are you now in a place where you think given the diversity of the business model that goldman should pretty much always earn cost of capital on a quarterly basis david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i mean i always is a definitive word we never saw always to anything because there certainly can be environments that we do not foresee that could produce the distribution of outcomes a very skewed outcome in one direction or the other i do think that this leadership team over the last almost four years has made significant investments in our business and that has allowed us to grow our business and that has allowed us to better plan in our business given some of the investments and planning process we made that hopefully over time will give the market more confidence in the durability of these returns i think were well positioned in february we laid out these mediumterm targets we do not lay out targets lightly so i would never comment on what could happen in any given quarter christian but i think we have a larger more durable business and i think were going to continue to add to that durability as we move forward and were very committed to executing on that strategy christian bolu q analyst autonomous research okay thanks on ficc and just maybe more broadly intermediation businesses how do you think about the potential going forward as the fed sort of shrink its balance sheet and raise rates trying to figure out the potential for meaningfully good volatility and greater demand for risk intermediation services versus any sort of funding cost headwinds that may occur david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so i mean i comment from a macro perspective on a couple of things with respect to that and im not smart enough to know what good volatility or bad volatility is were more focused on serving our clients and ensuring that we have the highest market share available with those clients as they position their portfolios that they transact intermediation is a big business i think its always going to be a big business that doesnt mean that it cant ebb and flow from quarter to quarter but i think that one way to frame this is that the size of the available intermediation activity thats out there for firms like ourselves to play a big role in this is bigger today than it was five years ago going back prepandemic the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 and in addition based on investments weve made both in the client centricity and the approach were taking and in technology our market shares are larger and we think those market share gains are durable id also highlight that weve been and weve been very clear with you on this building our financing capability for those clients and one of the things about that business now is a larger proportion of it is financing revenue and that financing revenue is more durable so i feel good about the way the business is positioned i wont speculate on what every quarter will look like going forward but certainly i think were better positioned in this business today than we were five years ago and i think thats reflected for example on a quarter like this and the results from the client activity were able to accomplish operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so wanted to start off with a question on capital management you guys were clear positive outliers in the quarter many of your peers reported pretty significant drawdowns in cet1 admittedly i was a bit surprised to see the improvement in your ratios just given a lot of the sources of rwa inflation that have been cited on some of the other calls have really highlighted market risk rwa inflation i was hoping you can just give some perspective on how much of an impact did you see from higher market risk rwas in the quarter where you could see some relief down the road and just given the accretion in capital you saw in the quarter whether there is any appetite to accelerate buybacks especially into a declining share price denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure steven thank you for the question as it relates to our build of capital over the course of the quarter that was deliberate we knew that at the beginning of the second quarter that we would have to pay for the nnip acquisition and so weve grown our capital over the course of the first quarter we also were very disciplined on rwa growth our growth was billion on a quarteroverquarter basis so we were able to deliver the types of results that david just made reference to across our big businesses while maintaining a discipline with respect to rwa growth and so that also contributed to the improvement now as it relates to our outlook weve been reasonably clear that our first priority in terms of driving longterm results for shareholders and supporting clients is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities and once again you would see in the first quarter with the global markets segment roe north of and firmwide roe at there certainly were attractive client deployment opportunities and we prioritized that we remain focused on sustainably growing a dividend and then obviously to the extent the opportunities to support clients where the market environment shifts obviously wed look to return that capital back to shareholders i would say from where i sit right now looking at the second quarter my expectation on buybacks is that would be reasonably consistent with the first quarter but we do expect to remain nimble and to the extent that the opportunity set with clients is less attractive and you make reference to the then prevailing share price thats obviously something that well consider steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 thats great color denis and just for my followup on the investment banking businesses you noted the backlogs are stable yearonyear certainly a good outcome given the macro uncertainty but i was hoping you could just provide a little bit more granularity on the individual investment banking businesses and more specifically how you expect them to perform over the next call it to months and how much of the slowdown that weve seen at least in the first quarter would you attribute to growing macro risks and waning ceo confidence that could drive a more prolonged slowdown versus maybe something thats more temporary due to the elevated market volatility david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so ill start steve and just say that that activity level is still quite high and engagement from our banking clients is still quite high there is no question that equity beta kind of turned off for the quarter and so one of the things that happened was a bunch of equity issuance that was supposed to happen in the quarter got pushed out that definitely is a market volatility effect and my guess is as the market volatility settles down during the course of the year to the degree that it does that will bring some of that issuance back into the marketplace weve seen when you look over the course of the last years plenty of periods of time where there are quarters where you have very very low equity issuance its been very rare that that continues for a year or a longer period that doesnt mean that that couldnt happen but certainly that wouldnt be expected given history and businesses need capital they need to make investments and at times as prices reset or values reset people need some time to absorb those changes versus their expectations but ultimately at the end of the day they understand the reality and they move forward i dont see a significant change in kind of strategic dialogue i would say if the world got materially worse or materially more volatile given some of the geopolitical stuff that was going on that certainly would have the potential to slow down some of the strategic activity and dialogue but at the moment that activity level and certainly the engagement remains quite good quite robust but we watch it very very closely i would note that i think its important to just recognize and we said this at the yearend at yearend call on the yearend call that the activity level that we saw in in the banking business nobody expected those to be normalized levels and so id certainly describe a little bit of what were seeing as a normalization and i think first quarter overall activity theres some normalization of that although i think equity is well below what i would call a normalized trend operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 i know we talked a lot about the investment banking side of the business maybe we could turn to the loan growth areas that youre focused on and just want to understand what youre expecting there from some of the recent acquisitions like greensky some of the new relationships that youve got i know its been a couple of years already but apple card is growing nicely from the gm relationship how should we think about the capital call that that piece of business will have and what kind of growth rate you expect to get this year thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hi betsy thank you very much for the question weve been very focused on growing these businesses and whether it be loan growth across the consumer platform in terms of installment loan business or the cards businesses or now with the acquisition of greensky or whether it be across private wealth channels or even across our ficc financing businesses we have a strategic objective to continue to grow those businesses in a creditsensitive fashion and in terms of thinking about the impact and how to think about that from the pl youll see that in the first quarter we did raise our provisions for credit losses they were at versus and a primary driver of that was our growth in loan activity so thats something that we expect across these businesses as we grow them we expect as we grow the portfolio of greensky that will also continue to provision so it remains focus for the firm were looking at across multiple channels and trying to keep in mind sort of underwriting credit quality as we do so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and thats kind of the followup i had because weve got the forward curve looking for something like nine rate hike this is year a few more next year and so theres a triangulation between rate hikes and credit quality and how are you thinking about that when you talk about the provision increase that youve done maybe you could unpack that a little bit as to how much of that was coming from loan volume increase expected versus what youre anticipating for credit quality changes given that backdrop i just mentioned denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure fair enough and thats a question were very very focused on i mean in terms of looking at the portfolio and its performance we have not yet seen a change in the overall credit quality of our portfolios we remain very mindful of that given some of the headwinds that are on the forward but if you look at metrics like our chargeoffs in the first quarter they were million net chargeoff rate of unchanged quarteroverquarter and as we think about growing these particular businesses underwriting standards and the credit box remain top of mind as we continue to grow and to the extent we see indications significantly slowing rates in terms of payments or the percentage of people making their minimum payments that are indications of future credit deterioration that will be a signal for us and we can obviously take riskmitigating actions in the forward as a result operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 hi if you could just david and team maybe just summarize where you think we are in terms of normalizing you said equity underwriting would be below normal and maybe trading its way above and i know nobody has a crystal ball and its tough but one of your competitor banks talked about volatility remaining elevated and i dont know just how should we think about the normalization of the legacy capital market businesses here and also how much did commodities contribute to this quarter was it a record or close to a record david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so mike i dont its and i know i just used it myself i use the term normalization were talking about the equity capital markets business its very easy for me to look at equity capital markets revenues for the quarter and say thats not a normalized run rate level for that business i would also tell you that the equity capital markets revenues in the first quarter of was not a normal level for the business when you talk about the broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and markets again i would amplify i dont have a crystal ball i cant tell you exactly where its going to settle out but i think these are good businesses we have a high degree of confidence that through market cycles we can produce very nice returns in these businesses we think its a very powerful ecosystem combining these two businesses together with the global scale and footprint that we have and we expect them to continue to be big contributors to accretive returns to allow us to meet our targets broadly commodities was not a record theres no question that when you look at the ficc macro business where it was really great performance it was well diversified across rates commodities and currencies i mean the macro businesses certainly outperformed but thats what id say to that point so again id go back i think these businesses are in terms of the available wallet for people like ourselves that compete in them they are fundamentally bigger than they were five years ago because the market cap growth around the world and that creates a good opportunity for us in addition weve continued to invest in things in those businesses which we think strengthen our competitive position but its hard for me to give you a predicted normal revenue number its just not that kind of business mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right let me follow up in a different way then in terms of your market share improvement with your capital markets businesses with corporates i know thats part of kind of the one firm directive can you do you have any metrics around that progress and how youre doing with corporates david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i mean we ill point out something that i think is an anecdotal metric but i think is interesting we have when you open the ma lead table which is something obviously we dominate we have billion lead for the quarter thats the largest onequarter lead weve ever had in our history in the ma lead table so thats a metric thats reflective of clients coming to us were tracking our market shares quite closely across investment banking and also across global markets and we see market share gains across both over the course of the last couple of years and well continue to track them and make investments where we think we can strengthen them to make sure theyre very durable the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question betsy asked about this broadly but maybe more narrowly with greensky now closed how should we think about those loans from my understanding their loans were securitized right so basically is the idea that they will mature off and as greensky underwrites new loans then those loans would be on goldmans balance sheet and so it would just sort of naturally migrate as the portfolio matures and is reissued and should we think about it just getting to that roughly billion level where greensky had been running how should we think about that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so in terms of our strategy we would expect over time that as greensky continues to originate we would take those loans on to our balance sheet we certainly would retain the flexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously but the goal over time is to ramp up those balances on to our balance sheet i think they had origination volumes of approximately billion in the first quarter and so were stepping into them based on that level of activity and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you for that and then similarly as far as deposits and deposit costs what are the expectation for deposit beta in marcus for this rate hiking cycle last cycle was a little unusual it was a growing and newer platform more established now as a happy marcus customer myself ive been watching my yield and it hasnt really moved much which is not that surprising because were just getting started but how should we be thinking about that on go forward denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc fair enough youre right to observe that we have not increased our marcus savings rate look in terms of how were thinking about the deposit betas across the channels i mean that really you really need a throughthe cycle experience we have a certain expectation for these businesses that will prove out through the cycle this cycle will be different than previous cycles obviously i would say at this very very beginning part of the cycle the experience is outperforming our expectations but i think thats because we recognize that the maturity of our portfolio and our time in the business is less than some of our biggest competitors but we remain really focused on managing that continuing to drive deposit growth and support the other origination activities across our lending platforms operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david and denis maybe ill just stick on the same theme here on consumer love to talk about just the consumer product roadmap and what we could expect from here im sure you dont want to kind of give away your entire hand here but just kind of what to think about as a natural extension coming next and then the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 obviously with the apple news and kind of where theyre going how that affects buy now pay later and any other kind of parts of the strategy in terms of timing denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay great thank you for the question so in terms of our aspirations to build the leading global digital consumer bank a lot of the pieces of the puzzle are in place at this point a lot of those investments have been made and we feel really good about the progress across the various lending and deposit platforms that weve invested in and built out i mean to give you a sense our active customers in the consumer space are north of million now and that number in the fourth quarter was less than million so we continue to see attractive active customer acquisition both organically and inorganically which is an important piece of the strategy i think perhaps next up on the product roadmap will be the launch of checking were already piloting that internally and we expect to launch that more broadly to our clients later this year and i think that will be an important piece of the product roadmap for us david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the only thing i would add to that devin as i just highlight back in the february update we put out a billion revenue target and i just want to tie that target to what denis said when he said most of the investments was made most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so thats something i want to amplify and then just finally because you referenced it our partnership with apple is very very strong while there has been a bloomberg article about what apple is doing apple nor we have have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time and i would just say were very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific thanks for all that color quick followup just on the operating leverage in the model and maybe just starting on comp ratio i know its very early in the year so its hard to give much of a prediction but comp ratio net of provision was basis points lower than the first quarter of last year even with i would say kind of an unfavorable mix so is there anything we should read into that just around kind of how to think about the full year just overall leverage on comp relative to revenues based on the current backdrop david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well as weve said always were a payforperformance culture this is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the first quarter we manage this very closely were comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively and we will also obviously payforperformance so im not going to speculate going forward but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time and we obviously the one thing id just highlight is our focus on our efficiency ratio and thats something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to this efficiency ratio and so that also affects our decisionmaking as we move forward operator your next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning a question just on asset management with the nn deal now closed do you see yourself as a scale provider with that property now and then within that maybe highlight or remind us what the opportunity set is with that business in terms of incremental growth now that its closed david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure and appreciate the question dan i mean i would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in europe it opens up some interesting distribution channels and it accelerates some of our capabilities around esgoriented products so it was a good step forward to expand that growth i believe carey will correct me if im wrong its the fifthlargest active asset manager in the world at the moment so fifth largest active asset manager in the world we see opportunity based on our footprint our global position our client mix our strong position in alternatives to continue to grow that business both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with nn and so were going to continue to strengthen our position there but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities in alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the firm daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thats helpful i guess just in similar context with wealth in terms of the outlook for growth thats also an area where there has been a fair amount of consolidation within the industry do you see yourself as a potential participant in that and maybe kind of the acceleration of hiring andor some of the initiatives you put in place how are you thinking about kind of the growth of the wealth business at this point david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well you can see from our earnings the growth of the wealth business yearoveryear we continue to be focused on that opportunity and id just highlight that thats a process that takes time you add wealth advisors you add footprint its a slower growth its a slower process if you do it organically but we see it as a very big opportunity i think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space its only been the last couple of years first through the united capital acquisition and also through our ayco channel were meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that weve been focused on really broadening that footprint i think were off to a good start there but i think there is a lot of organic opportunity that still exists i think our ayco channel goldman sachs ayco is a very very unique platform to work through corporations and i do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping their employees with wealth management services operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning david you made an interesting comment about when you were asked about the pipelines that it takes a little while for the potential issuers to realize that they need to reset maybe their expectations in your the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 experience how long does it take assuming markets dont come roaring back and id say they stay below where they were maybe months or months ago how long does it take for that reset to finally say okay yeah we still need to raise the capital even though its at lower levels than we originally would have liked david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think gerard its a hard question to answer very specifically some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business thats making those decisions is under but i think if you want me to make a very generic generalization these are not things it doesnt take a year for peoples mindset around the reality of markets to reset its more something that happens realtime over months or quarters gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup to another comment you made you talked about how the global capital markets today versus five years ago are much larger which obviously we have seen how much of an impact do you think the quantitative easing by the global central banks because i think now its over trillion of those balance sheets that are outstanding we all know the us fed is at trillion up from trillion at the start of the pandemic when we go into qt the us at least theyre going to bring those balances down what kind of effect any color on what you think may happen versus what happened over the past five years when those balances blew out david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well theres no question that and ive tried to say it in different ways and theres no science to this and no one knows obviously where the macro environment goes as we go forward but when you look at the volumes and the levels of and we said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reflection of some of that monetary fiscal policy that doesnt mean when you contract the monetary and fiscal policy that those businesses that these businesses go away and contract proportionally i think these are big businesses theres a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and financing that will continue to go on but theres no question its not going to operate at the levels that we saw in operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning maybe just talk about the bank a little bit youve kind of stealthily have grown the us bank to be sort of almost a top ten player i appreciate some of the color around the loan book and its rate sensitivity but the bank balance sheet is almost three to four times the size of the loan book so can you give us some sense of how we should think about asset sensitivity in a rising rate environment in the bank and if there is wed like to think that there is some material upside there given the size of the bank denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you for the question and to help through that i think theres a couple of things that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle on the one hand we do expect to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity that is modestly asset sensitive so when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest earning assets given the forward curve we think that will be a benefit to the firm the other thing that i should mention which is separate but probably also important just to be clear on and that is in the past we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the rolloff that fee waivers may have on the forward i would just point out that in the first quarter we had fee waivers of about million versus in the fourth quarter was about million and on the forward we expect those to be negligible so that too obviously only a one time benefit with the first hike but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc id also just highlight the im sorry jim id also just highlight that we continue to grow deposits and deposits are important for funding so our bank has many activities across the firm and obviously were growing our lending businesses but this strategy also affects our market businesses positively too james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities no absolutely i just im trying to think through ex the markets nii which obviously tends to be a liability sensitive but if you just think about the bank the loan book youve disclosed i think within the bank something like million to million from basis point move is it at least fair to say that the bank in total would nii benefit from basis point move would be better or worse just trying to think through the other parts of the balance sheet and how that nii could react and what that growth could look like if theres a way to frame that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah look i think i would just refocus you on my comments previously overall nii sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive i think just given the relative size even though weve grown it substantially given our relative size relative to some of our larger competitors and i think that proxy that i offer you on behalf of the firm is a good way of thinking about it operator your next question comes from the line of andrew lim with société générale andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so first of all can we talk about your management of the efficiency ratio last year it seems to be more volatile than usual i guess in the first three quarters it ran at quite a low level and then in the fourth quarter it seems like you had some kind of cost trueup both for compensation but also for noncomp i was wondering if we should expect the same thing again for this year the first three quarters running at a lower level and then the fourth quarter being higher and then what would you guide to really for the full year as a whole denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 14apr2022 okay thanks very much for the question andrew i think as david indicated from an overall framing perspective on firmwide operating expenses we have put out this efficiency target of approximately and that is a target and a lens through which we look at the combined set of expenses compensation and noncompensation the compensation level that we set for the first quarter obviously our best estimate right now based on what we pay for the full year but i could not predict for you at this point what our fullyear compensation ratio will be that will be a function of our performance the competitive landscape and our attention to the overall efficiency level efficiency ratio on the noncomp side were making decisions and taking steps to manage noncomp growth where we can make the types of investments that we think are important strategic investment for the longterm strength and growth of the firm like in areas such as technology and trying to manage other noncompensation expenses that are less strategic andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk great thanks and then just switching tack as a followup question you seem to be a leader in the crypto and blockchain space its been a few years coming now for banks to try and get some products off the ground but maybe this year we might see something a bit more material so i was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about sort of what we could expect maybe this year in terms of your product pipeline and what could be commercialized in the crypto and blockchain space david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well at a high level andrew what id say is were certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space but in terms of our product offering and what we can do were really following the regulatory lead and at the moment the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is really restrictive and very very small i dont have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of but were engaged in dialogue with our clients and certainly when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure payment systems and other activities in the financial market were extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how goldman sachs participates in that and how that will affect different business and business opportunities thats to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency and clients interest in cryptocurrency operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks carey halio headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc great thanks erica since there are no more questions wed like to thank everyone for joining the call and if you do have other questions that come up throughout the day please dont hesitate to reach out to
